Fifield, 13 Clifford's Inn, E.C.\nLove's Counterfeit\nStratford-on-Avon\nUnder the shade of the Kursaal veranda\nIdly I follow the flight of the seagulls,\nGleaming like snow when their wings catch the sunshine,\nWhile from the palm-house adjacent is wafted\nMusic half drowned in a babel of voices,\nFitting the mode of this temple of follies.\nFar though the mountains, their influence, ever\nChangeful in temper, from sombre to smiling,\nConstant in wileful and mystic allurement,\nRouses unrest and a strange fascination.\nLimpid and blue are the waters of Leman\nClear in the deepness, translucent and shining,\nBlue as the ether's ineffable azure,\nBright in the glow of the midsummer sunshine.\nCleaving the air with their palpitant pinions,\nWheeling and drifting, the beautiful seagulls\nFly with the grace of unconscious perfection,\nCrying exultant and wild in a chorus.\nAre you not fit for the realm of immortals,\nTo float on the winds of the gardens Elysian?\nOr must you hover a little while longer--\nWandering souls in a state of probation--\nHalf-way uplifted beyond our defilement,\nHalf-way removed from the land of the blessed?\nFar in the distance beyond the blue water,\nRises the hoary old father of mountains,\nRugged and scarred with antiquity's furrows,\nCrowned with the snows of a million winters.\nLow in the shade of his ponderous presence,\nDappling the slopes, are the homesteads of peasants,\nEach with its cloud of blue vapour ascending:\nAnd sweetly the bells across the green pastures\nAnswer each other with voices persistent,\nTelling the herdsman the tale of his charges.\nGrim is the smile of the white-headed mountain\nFor toilers below in the slumbering valley,\nGrim is the glance with a touch of derision,\nSeeming to say to his towering brothers--\nCatogne and the broad-shouldered heights of the Midi,\n\"Iguanodon,--Mastodon,--Man,--in their passing\nServe but as signs on the path of the ages.\"\nSoftly the plash of the waters of Leman\nSounds from the rough-tumbled stones at its margin:\nGently the zephyrs play over its surface,\nMaking it glitter with myriads of sparklets.\nSwiftly the barques trim their sails in the sunshine--\nSails high and slender that swell to the breezes,\nWhite as the snow on the breast of the Jungfrau--\nMirrored in whiteness upon the blue water.\nAs I sat watching the lake and the mountains,\nSlowly a haze like a curtain of muslin,\nFlimsy and fine like a texture of cobweb,\nDrifted and rose till it shut out the bases\nAnd bulk of the mountains across the still water,\nWhilst high above it the crests and sierras\nStood out as castles and walls of enchantment,\nRaised in the air like king Solomon's city,\nHeld up aloft by invisible genii.\nThen in the faintly drawn lines of escarpment,\nBattlements, pinnacles, turrets and bastions\nSprang into being, and fancy, untrammelled,\nPictured a palace with walls, and a fortress\nBeleaguered and stormed by a shadowy army,\nMassed under pennons seen dim through the vapour.\nOver the drawbridge a desperate sortie\nMade by the knights of the castle invested\nBrings the foes quickly in conflict together.\nPlumes white and restless like foam on the breakers\nDrift to and fro with the tide of the battle;\nFalchions and maces and curtaxes gleaming\nA moment aloft, strike sparks in descending\nOn corslet and casque and dinted escutcheon,\nWhilst out of the contest, with stumbling footsteps\nThe wounded are led sore stricken and helpless.\nLadies in sarcenet, arabesque broidered\nWith blossoms that climb fantastic in colour,--\nStiff flowers of blazonry's formal convention\nThat rise from the hem to the throat in profusion,\nWhere carcanets flash on bosoms unquiet,--\nLook from their casements with eyes full of wonder,\nDown on the conflict that rages below them,\nFierce in the shock and the heat of encounter,\nHearing the war-cries and clashing of weapons,\nWinding of horns, and the groans of the dying.\nTill all was lost in the thickening curtain,\nVeiled by the mist were my golden romances.\nOnce when a snowstorm swept over lake Leman\nFilling the distance with wildly tossed snowflakes,\nI pictured a scene in the heart of the mountains,\nHidden in shadows, unknown to the climber,\nOut of the range of Humanity's footsteps.\nThere is the cave where the slumbering ice god\nHides from the gaze of the wandering stranger,\nShut in the depths of the mountain's recesses,",

Heaven of their rays\nSeem'd joyous.  O thou northern site, bereft\nIndeed, and widow'd, since of these depriv'd!\nAs from this view I had desisted, straight\nTurning a little tow'rds the other pole,\nThere from whence now the wain had disappear'd,\nI saw an old man standing by my side\nAlone, so worthy of rev'rence in his look,\nThat ne'er from son to father more was ow'd.\nLow down his beard and mix'd with hoary white\nDescended, like his locks, which parting fell\nUpon his breast in double fold.  The beams\nOf those four luminaries on his face\nSo brightly shone, and with such radiance clear\nDeck'd it, that I beheld him as the sun.\n\"Say who are ye, that stemming the blind stream,\nForth from th' eternal prison-house have fled?\"\nHe spoke and moved those venerable plumes.\n\"Who hath conducted, or with lantern sure\nLights you emerging from the depth of night,\nThat makes the infernal valley ever black?\nAre the firm statutes of the dread abyss\nBroken, or in high heaven new laws ordain'd,\nThat thus, condemn'd, ye to my caves approach?\"\nMy guide, then laying hold on me, by words\nAnd intimations given with hand and head,\nMade my bent knees and eye submissive pay\nDue reverence; then thus to him replied.\n\"Not of myself I come; a Dame from heaven\nDescending, had besought me in my charge\nTo bring.  But since thy will implies, that more\nOur true condition I unfold at large,\nMine is not to deny thee thy request.\nThis mortal ne'er hath seen the farthest gloom.\nBut erring by his folly had approach'd\nSo near, that little space was left to turn.\nThen, as before I told, I was dispatch'd\nTo work his rescue, and no way remain'd\nSave this which I have ta'en.  I have display'd\nBefore him all the regions of the bad;\nAnd purpose now those spirits to display,\nThat under thy command are purg'd from sin.\nHow I have brought him would be long to say.\nFrom high descends the virtue, by whose aid\nI to thy sight and hearing him have led.\nNow may our coming please thee.  In the search\nOf liberty he journeys: that how dear\nThey know, who for her sake have life refus'd.\nThou knowest, to whom death for her was sweet\nIn Utica, where thou didst leave those weeds,\nThat in the last great day will shine so bright.\nFor us the' eternal edicts are unmov'd:\nHe breathes, and I am free of Minos' power,\nAbiding in that circle where the eyes\nOf thy chaste Marcia beam, who still in look\nPrays thee, O hallow'd spirit! to own her shine.\nThen by her love we' implore thee, let us pass\nThrough thy sev'n regions; for which best thanks\nI for thy favour will to her return,\nIf mention there below thou not disdain.\"\n\"Marcia so pleasing in my sight was found,\"\nHe then to him rejoin'd, \"while I was there,\nThat all she ask'd me I was fain to grant.\nNow that beyond the' accursed stream she dwells,\nShe may no longer move me, by that law,\nWhich was ordain'd me, when I issued thence.\nNot so, if Dame from heaven, as thou sayst,\nMoves and directs thee; then no flattery needs.\nEnough for me that in her name thou ask.\nGo therefore now: and with a slender reed\nSee that thou duly gird him, and his face\nLave, till all sordid stain thou wipe from thence.\nFor not with eye, by any cloud obscur'd,\nWould it be seemly before him to come,\nWho stands the foremost minister in heaven.\nThis islet all around, there far beneath,",

    "text": "'Tis midnight's holy hour, and silence now\nIs brooding, like a gentle spirit o'er\nThe still and pulseless world. Hark! on the winds\nThe bell's deep tones are swelling; 'tis the knell\nOf the departed year. No funeral train\nIs sweeping past; yet, on the stream and wood,\nWith melancholy light, the moonbeams rest\nLike a pale, spotless shroud; the air is stirred,\nAs by a mourner's sigh; and, on yon cloud,\nThat floats so still and placidly through heaven,\nThe spirits of the Seasons seem to stand.\nYoung Spring, bright Summer, Autumn's solemn form,\nAnd Winter with its aged locks--and breathe\nIn mournful cadences, that come abroad,\nLike the far windharps wild, touching wail,\nA melancholy dirge o'er the dead year,\nGone from the earth forever.\n'Tis a time\nFor memory and for tears. Within the deep,\nStill chambers of the heart, a spectre dim,\nWhose tones are like the wizard voice of time,\nHeard from the tomb of ages, points its cold\nAnd solemn finger to the beautiful\nAnd holy visions, that have passed away,\nAnd left no shadow of their loveliness\nOn the dead waste of life. The spectre lifts\nThe coffin-lid of Hope and Joy and Love,\nAnd bending mournfully above the pale,\nSweet forms that slumber there, scatters dead flowers\nO'er what has passed to nothingness.\nThe year\nHas gone, and with it many a glorious throng\nOf happy dreams. Its mark is on each brow,\nIts shadow in each heart. In its swift course,\nIt waved its sceptre o'er the beautiful;\nAnd they are not. It laid its pallid hand\nUpon the strong man: and the haughty form\nIs fallen, and the flashing eye is dim.\nIt trod the hall of revelry, where thronged\nThe bright and joyous; and the tearful wail\nOf stricken ones is heard, where erst the song\nAnd reckless shout resounded. It passed o'er\nThe battle plain, where sword, and spear and shield,\nFlashed in the light of midday; and the strength\nOf serried hosts is shivered, and the grass,\nGreen from the soil of carnage, waves above\nThe crushed and mouldering skeleton. It came,\nAnd faded like a wreath of mist at eve;\nYet, ere it melted in the viewless air,\nIt heralded its millions to their home,\nIn the dim land of dreams.\nRemorseless time!\nFierce spirit of the glass and scythe! What power\nCan stay him in his silent course, or melt\nHis iron heart to pity! On, still on,\nHe presses and forever. The proud bird,\nThe Condor of the Andes, that can soar\nThrough heaven's unfathomable depths, or brave\nThe fury of the northing hurricane,\nAnd bath its plumage in the thunder's home\nFurls his broad wing at nightfall, and sinks down\nTo rest upon his mountain crag; but Time\nKnows not the weight of sleep or weariness,\nAnd Night's deep darkness has no chain to bind\nHis rushing pinion.\nRevolutions sweep\nO'er earth, like troubled visions o'er the breast\nOf dreaming sorrow; cities rise and sink\nLike bubbles on the water; fiery isles\nSpring blazing from the ocean, and go back\nTo their mysterious caverns; mountains rear\nTo heaven their bold and blackened cliffs, and bow\nTheir tall heads to the plain; and empires rise,\nGathering the strength of hoary centuries,\nAnd rush down, like the Alpine avalanche,\nStartling the nations; and the very stars,\nYon bright and glorious blazonry of God,\nGlitter awhile in their eternal depths,\nAnd like the Pleiad, loveliest of their train,\nShoot from their glorious spheres, and pass away\nTo darkle in the trackless void; yet Time,\nTime, the tomb-builder, holds his fierce career,\nDark, stern, all pitiless, and pauses not\nAmid the mighty wrecks that strew his path,\nTo sit and muse, like other conquerors,\nUpon the fearful ruin he hath wrought.\nHow grace this hallowed day?\nShall happy bells, from yonder ancient spire,\nSend their glad greetings to each Christmas fire\nRound which the children play?\nHow shall we grace the day?\nAh! Let the thought that on this holy morn\nThe Prince of Peace-the Prince of Peace was born,\nEmploy us, while we pray!\nPray for the peace which long\nHath left this tortured land, and haply now\nHolds its white court on some far mountain's brow,\nThere hardly safe from wrong!\nLet every sacred fane\nCall its sad votaries to the shrine of God,",

    "text": "A Tale of the Spring-time\nIn the merry spring time, thus says my song,\nWhen the sun shines bright and the days grow long,\nAnd the crocuses brilliant, in purple and gold,\nBloom in the gardens in numbers untold;\nWhen in the fields the grass grows green,\nAnd a few early lambs are seen;\nWhen daffodils in gaudy gowns\nLook gay upon the verdant downs,\nAnd fair spring flowers of each degree\nIn every sheltered nook you see,\nUpon a bright and sunny day\nThe Crows to one-another say,\n\"CAW! CAW! our nests now let us build.\"\nAway they fly: each beak is fill'd\nWith little sticks of beechen wood,\nWith which they build their houses good:\nWhen all is done, with joy they see\nThe work of their community.\nAnd, circling widely, CAW! they say,\nCAW! CAW! our eggs now let us lay.\nTwo spotted eggs in every nest\nFor warmth await the mother's breast.\nAnd all the Crows around them fly\nWith flapping wings and joyful cry:\n\"CAW! CAW!\" they say, \"now it is fit\nThat we upon our eggs should sit.\"\nThe patient Crows for many a week\nNo other occupation seek;\nBut, while one sits and looks around,\nThe other makes the woods resound\nWith cawings loud, or frequent brings\nWorms, seeds, or such delicious things,\nAnd kindly feeds his brooding mate\nFrom early morn till evening late.\nTill, to reward their anxious care,\nA gentle sound the parents hear\nOf tapping from within the shell:\nThis sound doth please the mother well,\nAnd, fondly helping with her bill,\nShe hears the voices weak and shrill.\n\"Caw! Caw!\" the downy young ones say,\n\"How lovely is this peep of day,\nOh what a glorious sight is this,\nThere can be nothing here but bliss.\"\n\"CAW! CAW!\" replies the mother crow,\n\"There is no joy unmixed with woe.\"\nThe father crows with tender heart\nIn the parental cares take part--\n\"CAW! CAW!\" they say, \"for food we'll fly\nBefore our young ones hungry cry.\"\nIn course direct they fly afar\nTo where the ploughmen lab'ring are,\nAnd, seeking in the upturn'd soil,\nThey meet with many a wormy spoil;\nAnd, filling their capacious beak,\nStraightway their forest homes they seek.\nThe young crows see them homeward fly,\nAnd stretch their skinny necks on high;\nAnd gulping down the luscious food,\n\"Caw! Caw!\" they say, \"'tis very good.\"\nSo daily every parent flies,\nEach young one grows in strength and size;\nTill seated on a branch at length,\nExulting in increasing strength,\n\"Caw! Caw! Caw! Caw!\" they proudly cry,\n\"We shall be flying by and bye;\"\nBut ah, poor Crows, there's many a slip\nBetween the cup and longing lip.\nThe farmer heard the cawing sound,\nAnd sent to all his neighbours round,\nBegging of them every one\nTo bring a rifle or a gun,\nIf they would come the sport to see\nOf shooting at the rookery;\nAnd try to check the rural pest,\nWhich did the country so infest,\nAnd stop the robbery of corn,\nWhich was no longer to be borne.\nFor though the farmers had a plan\nTo scare them with the form of man,\nThe Crows, at first much terrified,\nAnd wheeling high in circles wide,\nHad soon become too bold for that;\nAnd even perched upon the hat,\nAnd loud in mockery cried \"CAW! CAW!\n'Tis nothing but a man of straw.\"\nThe next day, as the picture shows,\nThe farmers met to shoot the Crows--\nTheir rustling underneath the trees\nThe young ones thought was but the breeze;\nBut an old Crow's experienced eye\nDiscovered soon their enemy;\nWhose purpose was not left in doubt,\nFor, uttering a murderous shout,\nThe shooters levelled each his gun--\nBang! Bang! the slaughter is begun.\nBang! Bang! again for every ball\nWounded or dead the young Crows fall;\nThe old Crows wheeling in the skies",

Perhaps the night,\nMy foolish tremors, or the gleaming light,\nLent power to that Portrait dark and quaint--\nA Portrait such as Rembrandt loved to paint--\nThe likeness of a Nun.

The warm blue June was spread\nUpon the earth; blue summer overhead,\nWithout a cloud to fleck its radiant glare,\nWithout a breath to stir its sultry air.\nAll still, all silent, save the sobbing rush\nOf rippling waves, that lapsed in silver hush\nUpon the beach; where, glittering towards the strand,\nThe purple Mediterranean kissed the land.\nAll still, all peaceful; when a convent chime\nBroke on the mid-day silence for a time,\nThen trembling into quiet, seemed to cease,\nIn deeper silence and more utter peace.\nSo as I turned to gaze, where gleaming white,\nHalf hid by shadowy trees from passers' sight,\nThe Convent lay, one who had dwelt for long\nIn that fair home of ancient tale and song,\nWho knew the story of each cave and hill,\nAnd every haunting fancy lingering still\nWithin the land, spake thus to me, and told\nThe Convent's treasured Legend, quaint and old:\nLong years ago, a dense and flowering wood,\nStill more concealed where the white convent stood,\nBorne on its perfumed wings the title came:\n\"Our Lady of the Hawthorns\" is its name.\nThen did that bell, which still rings out to-day,\nBid all the country rise, or eat, or pray.\nBefore that convent shrine, the haughty knight\nPassed the lone vigil of his perilous fight;\nFor humbler cottage strife or village brawl,\nThe Abbess listened, prayed, and settled all.\nYoung hearts that came, weighed down by love or wrong,\nLeft her kind presence comforted and strong.\nEach passing pilgrim, and each beggar's right\nWas food, and rest, and shelter for the night.\nBut, more than this, the Nuns could well impart\nThe deepest mysteries of the healing art;\nTheir store of herbs and simples was renowned,\nAnd held in wondering faith for miles around.\nThus strife, love, sorrow, good and evil fate,\nFound help and blessing at the convent gate.\nOf all the nuns, no heart was half so light,\nNo eyelids veiling glances half as bright,\nNo step that glided with such noiseless feet,\nNo face that looked so tender or so sweet,\nNo voice that rose in choir so pure, so clear,\nNo heart to all the others half so dear,\nSo surely touched by others' pain or woe,\n(Guessing the grief her young life could not know,)\nNo soul in childlike faith so undefiled,\nAs Sister Angela's, the \"Convent Child.\"\nFor thus they loved to call her.  She had known\nNo home, no love, no kindred, save their own.\nAn orphan, to their tender nursing given,\nChild, plaything, pupil, now the Bride of Heaven.\nAnd she it was who trimmed the lamp's red light\nThat swung before the altar, day and night;\nHer hands it was whose patient skill could trace\nThe finest broidery, weave the costliest lace;\nBut most of all, her first and dearest care,\nThe office she would never miss or share,\nWas every day to weave fresh garlands sweet,\nTo place before the shrine at Mary's feet.\nNature is bounteous in that region fair,\nFor even winter has her blossoms there.\nThus Angela loved to count each feast the best,\nBy telling with what flowers the shrine was dressed.\nIn pomp supreme the countless Roses passed,\nBattalion on battalion thronging fast,\nEach with a different banner, flaming bright,\nDamask, or striped, or crimson, pink, or white,\nUntil they bowed before a newborn queen,\nAnd the pure virgin Lily rose serene.",
