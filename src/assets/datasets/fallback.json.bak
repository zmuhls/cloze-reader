That is a picture of life. Beneath this old Hebrew\nphrase there lurks a symbolism that covers our whole experience. But let us\njust now look at the most literal, and by no means the least true,\ninterpretation of these words. One of the great dividing-lines in human\nlife is the threshold-line. On one side of this line a man has his 'world\nwithin the world,' the sanctuary of love, the sheltered place of peace, the\nscene of life's most personal, sacred, and exclusive obligations. And on\nthe other side lies the larger life of mankind wherein also a man must take\nhis place and do his work. Life is spent in crossing this threshold-line,\ngoing out to the many and coming in to the few, going out to answer the\ncall of labour and coming in to take the right to rest. And over us all\nevery hour there watches the Almighty Love. The division-lines in the life\nof man have nothing that corresponds to them in the love of God. We may be\nhere or there, but He is everywhere.\n\n_The Lord shall keep thy going out._ Life has always needed that promise.\nThere is a pledge of help for men as they fare forth to the world's work.\nIt was much for the folk of an early time to say that as they went forth\nthe Lord went with them, but it is more for men to say and know that same\nthing to-day. The _going out_ has come to mean more age after age,\ngeneration after generation. It was a simpler thing once than it is now.\n'Thy going out'--the shepherd to his flocks, the farmer to his field, the\nmerchant to his merchandise. There are still flocks and fields and markets,\nbut where are the leisure, grace, and simplicity of life for him who has\nany share in the world's work? Men go out to-day to face a life shadowed by\nvast industrial, commercial, and social problems. Life has grown\ncomplicated, involved, hard to understand, difficult to deal with. Tension,\nconflict, subtlety, surprise, and amid it all, or over it all, a vast\nbrooding weariness that ever and again turns the heart sick. Oh the pains\nand the perils of the going out! There are elements of danger in modern\nlife that threaten all the world's toilers, whatever their work may be and\nwherever they may have to do it. There is the danger that always lurks in\n_things_--a warped judgement, a confused reckoning, a narrowed outlook. It\nis so easily possible for a man to be at close grips with the world and yet\nto be ever more and more out of touch with its realities. The danger in the\nplaces where men toil is not that God is denied with a vociferous atheism;\nit is that He is ignored by an unvoiced indifference. It is not the babel\nof the market-place that men need to fear; it is its silence. If we say\nthat we live only as we love, that we are strong only as we are pure, that\nwe are successful only as we become just and good, the world into which we\ngo forth does not deny these things--but it ignores them. And thus the real\nbattle of life is not the toil for bread. It is fought by all who would\nkeep alive and fresh in their hearts the truth that man doth not live by\nbread alone. For no man is this going out easy, for some it is at times\nterrible, for all it means a need that only this promise avails to\nmeet--'The Lord shall keep thy going out.' He shall fence thee about with\nthe ministry of His Spirit, and give thee grace to know, everywhere and\nalways, that thou art in this world to live for His kingdom of love and\ntruth and to grow a soul.\n\n_The Lord, shall keep ... thy coming in._ It might seem to some that once a\nman was safely across the threshold of his home he might stand in less need\nof this promise of help. But experience says otherwise. The world has\nlittle respect for any man's threshold. It is capable of many a bold and\nshameless intrusion. The things that harass a man as he earns his tread\nsometimes haunt him as he eats it. No home is safe unless faith be the\ndoorkeeper. 'In peace will I both lay me down and sleep, for Thou, Lord,\nalone makest me to dwell in safety.' The singer of that song knew that, as\nin the moil of the world, so also in the shelter of the place he named his\ndwelling-place, peace and safety were not of his making, but of God's\ngiving.\n\nSometimes there is a problem and a pain waiting for a man across his own\nthreshold. Many a man can more easily look upon the difficulties and perils\nof the outer world than he can come in and look into the pain-lined face of\nhis little child. If we cannot face alone the hostilities on one side of\nour threshold we cannot face alone the intimacies on the other side of it.\nAfter all, life is whole and continuous. Whatever the changes in the\nsetting of life, there is no respite from living. And that means there is\nno leisure from duty, no rest from the service of obedience, no cessation\nin the working of all those forces by means of which, or in spite of which,\nlife is ever being fashioned and fulfilled.\n\nAnd now let us free our minds from the literalism of this promise and get a\nglimpse of its deeper application to our lives. The threshold of the home\ndoes not draw the truest division-line in life between the outward and the\ninward. Life is made up of thought and action, of the manifest things and\nthe hidden things.\n\n'Thy going out.' That is, our life as it is manifest to others, as it has\npoints of contact with the world about us. We must go out. We must take up\nsome attitude toward all other life. We must add our word to the long human\nstory and our touch to the fashioning of the world. We need the pledge of\ndivine help in that life of ours in which, for their good or ill, others\nmust have a place and a part. 'And thy coming in'--into that uninvaded\nsanctum of thought. Did we say uninvaded? Not so. In that inner room of\nlife there sits Regret with her pale face, and Shame with dust on her\nforehead, and Memory with tears in her eyes. It is a pitiable thing at\ntimes, is this our coming in. More than one man has consumed his life in a\nflame of activity because he could not abide the coming in. 'The Lord shall\nkeep ... thy coming in.' That means help for every lonely, impotent, inward\nhour of life.\n\nLook at the last word of this promise--'for evermore.' Going out and coming\nin for evermore. I do not know how these words were interpreted when very\nliteral meanings were attached to the parabolic words about the streets of\ngold and the endless song. But they present no difficulty to us. Indeed,\nthey confirm that view of the future which is ever taking firmer hold of\nmen's minds, and which is based on the growing sense of the continuity of\nlife. To offer a man an eternity of music-laden rest is to offer him a poor\nthing. He would rather have his going out and his coming in. Yes, and he\nshall have them. All that is purest and best in them shall remain.\nHereafter he shall still go out to find deeper joys of living and wider\nvisions of life; still come in to greater and ever greater thoughts of God.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\nTHE HABIT OF FAITH\n\n\n  Trust in Him at all times, ye people.\n  Pour out your heart before Him.\n  God is a refuge for us.\n\n  Ps. lxii. 8.\n\nHere the Psalmist strikes the great note of faith as it should be struck.\nHe sets it ringing alike through the hours and the years. _Trust in Him at\nall times._ Faith is not an act, but an attitude; not an event, but a\nprinciple; not a last resource, but the first and abiding necessity. It is\nthe constant factor in life's spiritual reckonings. It is the\never-applicable and the ever-necessary. It is always in the high and\nlasting fitness of things. There are words that belong to hours or even\nmoments, words that win their meaning from the newly created situation. But\nfaith is not such a word. It stands for something inclusive and imperial.\nIt is one of the few timeless words in earth's vocabulary. For the deep\nroots of it and the wide range of it there is nothing like unto it in the\nwhole sweep of things spiritual. So the 'all times' trust is not for one\nmoment to be regarded as some supreme degree of faith unto which one here\nand there may attain and which the rest can well afford to look upon as a\ncounsel of perfection. This exhortation to trust in God at all times\nconcerns first of all the _nature_ of faith and not the _measure_ of it.\nAll real faith has the note of the eternal in it. It can meet the present\nbecause it is not of the present. We have grown familiar with the phrase,\n'The man of the moment.' But who is this man? Sometimes he is very\nliterally a man of the moment--an opportunist, a gambler with the hours, a\nfollower of the main chance. The moment makes him, and passing away unmakes\nhim. But the true man of the moment is the man to whom the moment is but\none throb in the pulse of eternity. For him the moment does not stand out\nin splendid isolation. It is set in its place between that which hath been\nand that which shall be. And its true significance is not something abiding\nin it, but something running through it. So is it in this great matter of\nfaith. Only the faith that can trust at all times can trust at any time.\nThe moment that faith heeds the dictation of circumstance it ceases to be\nfaith and becomes calculation. All faith is transcendent. It is independent\nof the conditions in which it has to live. It is not snared in the strange\nweb of the tentative and the experimental. He that has for one moment felt\nthe power of faith has got beyond the dominion of time.\n\n_Trust in Him at all times._ That is the only real escape from confusion\nand contradiction in the judgements we are compelled to pass upon life.\nTimes change so suddenly and inexplicably. The hours seem to be at strife\nwith each other. We live in the midst of a perpetual conflict between our\nyesterdays and our to-days. There is no simple, obvious sequence in the\nmessage of experience. The days will not dovetail into each other. Life is\ncompact of much that is impossible of true adjustment at the hands of any\ntime-born philosophy. And in all this seeming confusion there lies the\nnecessity for faith. Herein it wins its victory. We are to trust God not\nbecause we cannot trace Him, but that by trusting Him we may ever be more\nable to trace Him and to see that He has a way through all these winding\nand crossing paths. Faith does more than hold a man's hand in the darkness;\nit leads him into the light. It is the secret of coherence and harmony. It\ndoes not make experience merely bearable, it makes it luminous and\ninstructive. It takes the separate or the tangled strands of human\nexperience and weaves them into one strong cable of help and hope.\n\n_Trust in Him at all times._ Then faith at its best is a habit. Indeed,\nreligion at its best is a habit, too! We are sometimes too ready to\ndiscount the worth of the habitual in our religious life. We put a premium\non self-consciousness. We reduce the life of faith to a series of acts of\nfaith of varying difficulty and import, but each detached from the rest and\nindividually apprehended of the soul. Surely this is all wrong. In our\nphysical life we are least conscious of those functions that are most vital\nand continuous, and the more perfectly they do their work the less we think\nabout them. The analogy is incomplete and must be drawn with care. But when\nyou have conceded that faith has to be acquired, that it has to be learned,\nthere is still this much in the analogy. If faith is a long and hard\nlesson, the value of the lesson to us is not the effort with which we learn\nit, but the ease with which we apply it. The measure of conscious effort in\nour faith is the measure of our faith's weakness. When faith has become a\nspontaneity of our character, when it turns to God instinctively, when it\ndoes its work with the involuntariness of habit, then it has become strong.\n\n_Pour out your heart before Him._ How this singer understood the office and\nprivilege of the 'all times' trust! He knew that there is a fullness of\nheart that is ill to bear. True, in more than one simple way the full heart\ncan find some slight relief. There is work. The full heart can go out and\ndo something. There is a brother's trouble in which a man may partly forget\nhis own. There is sympathy. Surely few are so lonely that they cannot find\nany one ready to offer the gift of the listening ear, any one willing to\nshare with them all of pain and burden that can be shared. Ah! but what of\nthat which cannot be shared? What of the sorrow that has no language, and\nthe shame and confusion that we would not, and even dare not, trail across\na friend's mind? So often the heart holds more than ever should be poured\nout into another's ear. There are in life strained silences that we could\nnot break if we would. And there is a law of reticence that true love and\nunselfishness will always respect. If my brother hath joy, am I to cloud it\nwith my grief? If he hath sorrow, am I to add my sorrow unto his? When our\nprecious earthly fellowship has been put to its last high uses in the hour\nof sorrow or shame, the heart has still a burden for which this world finds\nno relief. But there is another fellowship. There is God our Father. There\nis the ear of Heaven. We may be girt with silence among our fellows, but in\nlooking up the heart finds freedom. In His Presence the voice of confession\ncan break through the gag of shame, and the pent-up tide of trouble can let\nitself break upon the heart of Eternal Love.\n\n_God is a refuge for us._ That is the great discovery of faith. That is the\nmerciful word that comes to be written so plainly in the life that has\nformed the habit of faith. God our refuge. It may be that to some the word\n'refuge' suggests the occasional rather than the constant need of life. But\nthe refuge some day and the faith every day are linked together. A thing is\nno use to you if you cannot find it when you want it. And you cannot find\nit easily if it be not at hand. The peasant built his cottage under the\nshadow of his lord's castle walls. In the hour of peril it was but a step\nto the strong fortress. 'Trust in Him at all times.' Build your house under\nthe walls of the Eternal Help. Live in the Presence. Find the attitude of\nfaith, and the act of faith will be simple. Trust in Him through every\nhour, and when a tragic hour comes one step shall take you into the\ninnermost safety.\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\nTHE ONE THING DESIRABLE\n\n\n  One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will\n  I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of\n  the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the\n  beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in His temple.\n\n  Ps. xxvii. 4.\n\n_I have desired ... I will seek._ Amid the things that are seen, desire and\nquest are nearly always linked closely together. The man who desires money\nseeks after money. The desire of the world is often disappointed, but it is\nrarely supine. It is dynamic. It leads men. True, it leads them astray; but\nthat is a reflection on its wisdom and not on its effectiveness. Among what\nwe rightly call the lower things men do not play with their desires, they\nobey them. But amid the unseen realities of life it is often quite\notherwise. In the religious life desire is sometimes strangely ineffective.\nIt is static, if that be not a contradiction in terms. In many a life-story\nit stands written: One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I dream\nof, that will I hope for, that will I wait for. Many things help to explain\nthis attitude, and, explaining it, they condemn it also. We allow our\nsurroundings to pass judgement on our longings. We bring the eternal to the\nbar of the hour, and postpone the verdict. Or it may be in the worldliness\nof our hearts we admit the false plea of urgency and the false claim of\nauthority made by our outward life. And perhaps more commonly the soul\nlacks the courage of its desires. It costs little to follow a desire that\ngoes but a little way, and that on the level of familiar effort and within\nsight of familiar things. It is another thing to hear the call of the\nmountains and to feel the fascination of some far and glittering peak. That\nis a call to perilous and painful effort. And yet again, high desire\nsometimes leaves life where it found it because the heart attaches an\nintrinsic value to vision. It is something to have _seen_ the Alpine\nheights of possibility. Yes, it is something, but what is it? It is a\ngolden hour to the man who sets out to the climb; it is an hour of shame\nand judgement, hereafter to be manifest, to the man who clings to the\ncomforts of the valley.\n\n_One thing have I desired._ When a man speaks thus unto us, we have a right\nto ponder his words with care. We naturally become profoundly interested,\nexpectant, and, to the limit of our powers, critical. If a man has seen one\nthing that he can call simply and finally the desire of his heart, it ought\nto be worth looking at. We expect something large, lofty, inclusive. And we\nfind this: '_That I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my\nlife, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in His temple._' Let\nus examine this desire, And, first of all, we must free our minds from mere\nliteralism. If we do not, we shall find in this desire many things that are\nnot in it, and miss everything that is in it. This is not the longing for a\ncloistered life, the confession of one who is weary of this heavy world,\ndoubtful of its promises and afraid of its powers. 'The house of the Lord'\nis not a place, but a state, not an edifice, but an attitude. It is a fair\nand unseen dwelling-place builded by the hands of God to be the home, here\nand hereafter, of all the hearts that purely love and worship Him. We read\nof one who, a day's march from his father's house, lay down and slept; and\nin his sleep God spake to him, and lo, out in a wild and lonely place,\nJacob said, 'This is none other but the house of God.' For every one to\nwhom the voice of God has come, and who has listened to that voice and\nbelieved in its message, the mountains and valleys of this fair world, the\nbreath of every morning and the hush of every evening, are instinct with a\nPresence. Wordsworth dwelt in the house of the Lord all the days of his\nlife. And if the wonder and beauty of the earth lift up our hearts unto our\nGod in praise and worship, we dwell there also.\n\nYes, but this world is a world of men. In city or on hillside the great\npersistent fact for us, the real setting of our life, is not nature, but\nhumanity. Life is not a peaceful vision of earthly beauty. Our experience\nis not a dreamy pastoral. There are shamed and broken lives. The world is\nfull of greed and hate and warfare and sorrow. Nature at its best cannot by\nitself build for us a temple that humanity at its worst, or even at\nsomething less than its worst, cannot pull down about our ears. For the\nPsalmist, probably David himself, the temple was symbolic of all heavenly\nrealities. It stood for the holiness and the nearness and the mercy of God,\nand for the sacredness and the possibility of human life. In the light and\npower and perfect assurance of these things he desired to dwell all the\ndays of his life. For us there is the life and word of One greater than the\ntemple. Jesus of Nazareth dwelt in the house of the Lord. Between Him and\nGod the Father there was perfect union. And no one ever saw the worth of\nhuman life as Jesus saw it. And no one ever measured the sacred values of\nhumanity as He measured them. And now, in the perfect mercy of God, there\nis no man but may dwell in the house of God alway and feel life's\nsacredness amidst a thousand desecrations, and know its preciousness amidst\nall that seeks to obscure, defile, and cheapen it.\n\n_To behold the beauty of the Lord._ It is only in the house of the Lord,\nthe unseen fane of reverence, trust, and communion, that a man can learn\nwhat beauty is, and where to look for it. Out in the world beauty is held\nto be a sporadic thing. It is like a flower growing where no one expected a\nblossom. It is an unrelated and unexplained surprise. It is a green oasis\nin the desert of unlovely and unpromising things. But for the dweller in\nthe house of the Lord beauty is not on this wise. Said one such dweller,\n'The desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose.' He looked across the\nleagues of burning sand and saw the loveliness of Carmel by the sea, and of\nSharon where the lilies grow. To the artist beauty is an incident, to the\nsaint beauty is a law of life. It is the thing that is to be. It is the\npositive purpose, throbbing and yearning and struggling in the whole\nuniverse. When it emerges and men behold it, they behold the face of truth;\nand if it emerges not, it is still there, the fundamental fact and the\nvital issue of human life. To dwell in the Divine Presence by faith and\nobedience; to live so near to God that you can see all about yourself and\nevery human soul the real means of life, and straight before you the real\nend of life; to know that though so often the worst is man's dark choice,\nyet ever the best is his true heritage; and to learn to interpret the whole\nof life in the terms of God's saving purpose,--this is to behold the beauty\nof the Lord.\n\n_And to inquire in His temple._ The Psalmist desired for himself an inward\nattitude before God that should not only reveal unto him the eternal\nfitness of all God's ways and the eternal grace of all His purposes, but\nshould also put him in the way of solving the various problems that arise\nto try the wisdom and strength of men's lives. Sometimes the first court of\nappeal in life, and always the last, is the temple court. When all the\nworld is dumb, a voice speaks to them that worship. Reverential love never\nloses its bearings. In this world we need personal and social guidance, and\nthere must be many times when both shall be wanting unless we have learned\nto carry the burden of our ignorance to the feet of the Eternal Wisdom. And\nperhaps a man can desire no better thing for himself than that the\nreverence and devotion of his life should be such as to make the appeal to\nGod's perfect arbitrament an easy thing.\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\nEYES AND FEET\n\n\n  Mine eyes are ever toward the Lord,\n  For He shall pluck my feet out of the net.\n\n  Ps. xxv. 15.\n\nIn any man's life a great deal depends upon outlook. In some ways we\nrecognize this fact. We do not by choice live in a house whose windows\nfront a blank wall. A little patch of green grass, a tree, a peep of sky,\nor even the traffic of a busy street--anything rather than a blank wall.\nThat is a sound instinct, but it ought to go deeper than it sometimes does.\nThis outlook and aspect question is important when you are building a\nhouse, but it is vastly more important when you are building a character.\nThe soul has eyes. The deadliest monotony is that of a dull soul. Life is a\npoor affair for any man who looks out upon the blind walls of earthly\ncircumstance and necessity, and cannot see from his soul's dwelling-place\nthe pink flush of the dawn that men call hope, and who has no garden where\nhe may grow the blossoms of faith and sweet memory, the fair flowers of\nholy human trusts and fellowships. Only the divinity of life can deliver us\nfrom the monotony of living. 'Mine eyes are ever toward the Lord.' This man\nhas an infinite outlook. It matters not whether he looked out through\npalace windows or lived in the meanest house in Jerusalem's city. It is the\neye that makes the view. This man had a fairer prospect than ever man had\nwho looked seaward from Carmel or across the valleys from the steeps of\nLibanus. It was his soul that claimed the prospect. From the window of the\nlittle house of life he saw the light of God lying on the everlasting\nhills. That is the real deliverance from the monotony of things. The man\nwho is weary of life is the man who has not seen it. The man who is tied to\nhis desk sometimes thinks everything would be right if only he could\ntravel. But many a man has done the Grand Tour and come back no better\ncontented. You cannot fool your soul with Mont Blanc or even the Himalayas.\nSo many thousand feet, did you say?--but what is that to infinity! The cure\nfor the fretful soul is not to go _round_ the world; it is to get _beyond_\nit.\n\n_Mine eyes are ever toward the Lord._ That is the view we want. We gaze\ncontemptuously on the little one-story lodge just inside the park gates,\nand fail to get a glimpse of the magnificent mansion, with its wealth of\nadornment and treasure, that lies a mile among the trees. No wonder that\nmen grow discontented or contemptuous when they mistake the porch for the\nhouse. If a man would understand himself and discover his resources and put\nhis hand on all life's highest uses, he must look out and up unto his God.\nThen he comes to know that sunrise and sunset, and the beauty of the earth,\nand child-life and old age, and duty and sorrow, and all else that life\nholds, are linked to the larger life of an eternal world.\n\nThat is the true foresight. They called him a far-seeing man. How did he\nget that name? Well, he made a fortune. He managed to make use of the ebb\nand flow of the market, and never once got stranded. He was shrewd and did\nsome good guessing, and now, forsooth, they say he is 'very far-seeing.'\nBut he has not opened his Bible for years, and the fountains of sympathy\nare dried up in his soul. He can see as far into the money column as most\nmen, but the financial vista is not very satisfying for those who see it\nbest. The Gospel of St. John is a sealed book to him, and that is in God's\nhandwriting and opens the gates of heaven. Far-seeing? Why, the man is in a\ntiny cell, and he is going blind. 'Mine eyes are ever toward the Lord.'\nThat is the far-sighted man. He can see an ever larger life opening out\nbefore him. He can see the glory of the eternal righteousness beneath his\ndaily duties and the wonder of eternal love in the daily fellowships and\nfulfilments of the brotherhood. This is measuring life by the heavenly\nmeasurement. This is the vision we need day by day and at the end of the\ndays. For interest in some things must wane, and life must become less\nresponsive to all that lies about it, and many an earthly link is broken\nand many an earthly window is darkened, and the old faces and old ways\npass, and the thing the old man cherishes is trodden under foot by the\nimpetuous tread of a new generation, and desire fails. Then it is well with\nhim whose eyes have already caught glimpses of 'the King in His beauty,'\nand 'the land that is very far off.'\n\nBut think for a moment of the present value of the divine outlook upon\nlife. It brings guidance and deliverance. Set side by side the two\nexpressions 'eyes unto the Lord,' and 'feet out of the net.' Life is more\nthan a vision; it is a pilgrimage. We see the far white peaks whereon rests\nthe glory of life, but reaching them is not a matter of eyes, but of feet.\nHere, maybe, the real problem of godly living presents itself to us. Here\nour Christian idealism lays a burden on us. It is possible to see distances\nthat would take days to traverse. Even so we can see heights of spiritual\npossibility that we shall not reach while the light holds good unless we\nfoot it bravely. And it is not an easy journey. There are so many snares\nset for the pilgrims of faith and hope. There are subtle silken nets woven\nof soft-spun deceits and filmy threads of sin; and there are coarse strong\nnets fashioned by the strong hands of passion and evil desire. There are\nnets of doubt and pain and weakness. But think of the man whose eyes were\never towards the Lord. He came through all right. He always does. He always\nwill. He looked steadily upward to his God. When we get into the net we\nyield to the natural tendency to look down at our feet. We try to discover\nhow the net is made. We delude ourselves with the idea that if only we take\ntime we shall be able to extricate ourselves; but it always means getting\nfurther entangled. It is a waste of time to study the net. Life is ever\nweaving for us snares too intricate for us to unravel and too strong for us\nto break. God alone understands how they are made and how they may be\nbroken. He does not take us round the net or over it, but He does not leave\nus fast by the feet in the midst of it. He always brings a man out on the\nheavenward side of the earthly difficulty. Look upward and you are bound to\ngo forward.\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\nTHE SAFEGUARDED SOUL\n\n\n  The Lord shall keep thee from all evil;\n  He shall keep thy soul.\n\n  Ps. cxxi. 7.\n\nOne of the great offices of religion is to help men to begin at the\nbeginning. If you wish to straighten out a tangle of string, you know that\nit is worth your while to look patiently for one of the ends. If you make\nan aimless dash at it the result is confusion worse confounded, and\nby-and-by the tangle is thrown down in despair, its worst knots made by the\nhands that tried in a haphazard way to simplify it. Life is that tangle;\nand religion, if it does not loosen all the knots and straighten all the\ntwists, at least shows us where the two ends are. They are with God and the\nsoul. God deals with a man's soul. We cannot explain the facts of our\nexperience or the fashion of our circumstance save in as far as we can see\nthese things reflected in our character. The true spiritual philosophy of\nlife begins its inquiry in the soul, and works outward into all the\npuzzling mass of life's details. And the foundation of such a philosophy is\nnot experience, but faith. It is true that experience often confirms faith,\nbut faith interprets experience. Experience asks more questions than it can\nanswer. It collects more facts than it can explain. It admits of many\ndifferent constructions being put upon it. It puts us first of all into\ntouch with the problem of life rather than the solution. If the gentle,\npatient words of the saint are the utterance of one who has suffered, so\nalso are the bitter protests of the disappointed worldling. The fashion of\nthe experience may be the same in each case. It is faith that makes the\nlesson different. It is a want of faith that makes us expect the lower in\nlife to explain the higher, the outward to shed light upon the inward. We\npluck with foolish, aimless fingers at this strange tangle of human life.\nWe judge God's way with us as far as we can see it, and we think we have\ngot to the end of it. We draw our shallow conclusions. Faith teaches us\nthat God's way with us is a longer and a deeper way, and the end of that\nway is down in the depths of our spirit, hidden in the love of our\ncharacter. It is not here and now. It is in what we shall be if God have\nHis will with us.\n\nAll the true definitions of things are written in the soul. It was here\nthat the Psalmist found his definition of evil. 'The Lord shall keep thee\nfrom all evil; He shall keep thy soul.' Then evil is something that\nthreatens the soul. It is not material, but spiritual. It is not in our\ncircumstances themselves, but in their effect upon the inward life. The\nsame outward conditions of life may be good or evil according to their\ninfluence on our character. Good and evil are not qualities of things. They\nhave no meaning apart from the soul. The world says that health and wealth\nare good, and that sickness and poverty are evil. If that were true the\nline that separates the healthy from the sick, the rich from the poor,\nwould also separate the happy from the miserable. But we find joy and\nsorrow on both sides of that line. We are drawn to look deeper than this\nfor our definition of good and evil. We have to make the soul the final\narbiter amid these conflicting voices. Here we must find the true\ndefinition of evil. The first question we ask when we hear of a house\nhaving been burnt down is this: 'Was there any loss of life?' All else lies\non a vastly lower plane of interest and importance. So must we learn to\ndistinguish between the house of circumstance, or the house of the body,\nand the soul that dwells in it. The only real loss is the 'loss of life,'\nthe loss of any of these inner things that go to make the soul's strength\nand treasure. The man who has lost everything except faith and hope has,\nmaybe, lost nothing at all. There are some among the pilgrims of faith\nto-day who would never have been found there had not God cast upon their\nshoulders the ragged cloak of poverty; and if you know anything about that\nband of pilgrims you will know that the man who outstrips his companions is\noften a man who is lame on both his feet.\n\nO sceptic world, this is the final answer to your scepticism, an answer\nnone the less true because you cannot receive it: _The Lord keepeth the\nsouls of His saints._ Have you not seen men thinning out a great tree,\ncutting off some of its noblest branches and marring its splendid symmetry?\nAnd very likely you have felt it was a great shame to do so. But that work\nof maiming and spoiling meant light and sunshine and air in a close and\ndarkened room. It meant health to the dwellers in the house over which the\ntree had cast its shadow. It is much to have tall and stately trees in the\ngarden of life. But by-and-by that great oak of vigour begins to darken the\nwindows of faith, and God lops some of the branches. We call it suffering,\nbut it means more light. Or it may be that those firs of lordly ambition\nhave grown taller than the roof-tree, and God sends forth His storm-wind to\nlay them low. We call it failure, but it means a better view of the stars.\nAh, yes, we are over-anxious about the trees in the garden. God cares most\nof all that the light of His truth and the warmth of His love and the\nbreath of His Spirit shall reach and fill every room in the house of life.\n\n_He shall keep thy soul._ That is a promise that can fold us in divine\ncomfort and peace, and that can do something towards interpreting for us\nevery coil of difficulty, every hour of pain. But if this is to be so, we\nmust ourselves be true to the view of life the promise gives us. We must\nthink of the soul as God thinks of it. We live in a world where souls are\ncheap. They are bought and sold day by day. It is strange beyond all\nunderstanding that the only thing many a man is not afraid of losing is the\none thing that is really worth anything to him--his soul. Sometimes the\nlusts of the world drag down our heart's desire, and we have to confess\nwith shame to moments in our experience when we have not been at all\nconcerned with what became of our soul so long as the desire of the hour\nwas fulfilled or satisfied. We need to seek day by day that the masterful\nand abiding desires of our heart may be set upon undying good, and that our\naspiration may never fold its wings and rest on anything lower than the\nhighest. This shall not make dreamers of us. It shall stand us in good\nstead in the thick of the world. The man who gets 'the best of the bargain'\nis always the man who is most honest; for the most precious thing that a\nman stands to win or lose in any deal is the cleanness of his soul. The man\nwho gets the best of the argument is always the man who is most truthful;\nfor a quiet conscience is better than a silenced opponent. The man who gets\nthe best of life is the man who keeps the honour of his soul; for Jesus\nsaid: 'What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his\nown soul?'\n\nSo then, amid the manifold uncertainties of human life and the\never-changing forms and complexions of human experience, one thing is\npledged beyond all doubt to every man who seeks the will of God and the\npromise for the safeguarding of his soul. He may write this at the top of\nevery page in the book of life. He may take it for his light in dark days,\nhis comfort in sad days, his treasure in empty days. He may have it on his\nlips in the hour of battle and in his heart in the day of disappointment.\nHe may meet his temptations with it, interpret his sufferings with it,\nbuild his ideal with it. And it shall come to pass that he shall learn to\nlook with untroubled eyes upon the outward things of life, nor fear the\ntouch of its thousand grasping hands, knowing that his soul is in the hands\nof One who can keep it safe in all the world's despite, even God Himself.\n\n\n\n\nVI.\n\nA PLEA FOR TEARS\n\n\n  They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.\n  He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed,\n  Shall doubtless come again with rejoicing,\n  Bringing his sheaves with him.\n\n  Ps. cxxvi. 5, 6.\n\nIt is almost impossible to recall the joys and sorrows of life without\nhaving some thought of their compensative relation. We set our bright days\nagainst our dark days. We weigh our successes against our failures. When\nthe hour through which we are living is whispering a bitter message, we\nrecall the kindlier messages of other hours and say that we have much for\nwhich we ought to be thankful. And such a deliberate handling of\nexperience, such a quiet adjustment of memories, is not without its uses.\nAny view of life that will save a man from whining is worth taking. Any\nreckoning that will prevent a man from indulging in self-pity--that\nsubtlety of selfishness--is worth making. There is, moreover, something\nvery simple and obvious in this way of thinking and judging. To make one\nkind of experience deal with another kind, to set the days and the hours in\nbattle array--or shall we say to arrange a tourney where some\ngaily-caparisoned and well-mounted Yesterday is set to tilt with a\nblack-visored and silent To-day--is a way of dealing with life which seems\nto have much to commend it. But it has at the best serious limitations, and\nat the worst it may issue in a tragedy. The wrong knight may be unhorsed.\nThe award may go to him of the black plume. Pitting one experience against\nanother has gone to the making of many a cynic and not a few despairing\nsouls. The compensative interpretation of joy and sorrow may bring an\nanswer of peace to a man's soul, or it may not. But in this matter we are\ndealing with things in which we cannot afford to risk an equivocal or a\ndespairing answer. We must win in every encounter. It is not an hour's joy,\nbut a life's outlook that is at stake. No hour's fight was ever worth\nfighting if it was fought for the sake of the hour. The moments are ever\nchallenging the eternal, the swift and busy hours fling their gauntlets at\nthe feet of the ageless things. The real battle of life is never between\nyesterday and to-day; it is always between to-day and the Forever.\n\nTo isolate an experience is to misinterpret it. We may even completely\nclassify experiences, and yet completely misunderstand experience. To\nunderstand life at all we must get beyond the incidental and the\nalternating. Life is not a series of events charged with elements of\ncontrast, contradiction, or surprise. It is a deep, coherent, and\nunfaltering process. And one feels that it was something more than the\nchance of the moment that led the singer of old to weave the tears and the\nrejoicings of men's lives into a figure of speech that stands for unity of\nprocess, even the figure of the harvest.\n\n_They that sow in tears shall reap in joy._ The sweep of golden grain is\nnot some arbitrary compensation for the life of the seed cast so lavishly\ninto the ground, and biding the test of darkness and cold. It is the very\nseed itself fulfilled of all its being. Even so it is with the sorrows of\nthese hearts of ours and the joy unto which God bringeth us. He does not\nfling us a few glad hours to atone for the hours wherein we have suffered\nadversity. There is a deep sense in which the joys of life are its ripened\nsorrows.\n\n_They that sow in tears.... He that goeth forth and weepeth._ These are not\nthe few who have been haunted by apparent failure, or beset with outwardly\npainful conditions of service. They are not those who have walked in the\nshadow of a lost leader, or toiled in the grey loneliness of a lost comrade\nor of a brother proved untrue. For apparent failure, outward difficulty and\nloneliness, often as we may have to face them, are, after all, only the\naccidents of Godward toil. And if the bearer of seed for God's great\nharvest should go forth to find no experience of these things, still, if he\nis to do any real work in the fields of the Lord, he must go forth weeping.\nHe must sow in tears. Let a man be utterly faithful and sincere, let him\nopen his heart without reserve to the two great claims of the ideal and\nsympathy, and he shall come to know that he has not found the hidden\nmeaning of daily service, nor learned how he can best perform that service,\nuntil he has tasted the sorrow at the heart of it. The tears that are the\npledge of harvest are not called to the eyes by ridicule or opposition.\nThey are not the tears of disappointment, vexation, or impotence. They are\ntears that dim the eyes of them that see visions, and gather in the heart\nof them that dream dreams. To see the glory of God in the face of Jesus\nChrist and the blindness of the world's heart to that glory; to see\nunveiled the beauty that should be, and, unveiled too, the shame that is;\nto have a spiritual nature that thrills at the touch of the perfect love\nand life, and responds to every note of pain borne in upon it from the\nmurmurous trouble of the world,--this is to have inward fitness for the\nhigh work of the Kingdom. Yes, and it is the pledge that this work shall be\ndone. There is such a thing as artistic grief. There is the vain and\nlanguorous pity of aestheticism. Its robe of sympathy is wrapped about\nitself and bejewelled with its own tears. And it never goes forth. You\nnever meet it in 'the darkness of the terrible streets.'\n\n_He that goeth forth and weepeth._ It is his tears that cause him to go\nforth. It is his sorrow that will not let him rest. True pity is a mighty\nmotive. When the real abiding pathos of life has gripped a man's heart, you\nwill find him afield doing the work of the Lord. You will not see his\ntears. There will be a smile in his eyes and, maybe, a song on his lips.\nFor the sorrow and the joy of service dwell side by side in a man's life.\nIndeed, they often seem to him to be but one thing. It were a mistake to\nrefer the whole meaning of the words about a man's coming 'again with\nrejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him' to some far day when the reapers\nof God shall gather the last great harvest of the world. Through his tears\nthe sower sees the harvest. Through all his life there rings many a sweet\nprophetic echo of the harvest home.\n\n_He that goeth forth and weepeth._ No man ever wept like that and went not\nforth, but some go forth who have not wept. And they go forth to certain\nfailure. They mishandle life, and with good intent do harm. But that is not\nthe worst thing to be said about these toilers without tears. It is not\nthat they touch life so unskilfully, but they touch so little of it. It is\nonly through his tears that a man sees what his work is and where it lies.\nTearless eyes are purblind. We have yet much to learn about the real needs\nof the world. So many try very earnestly to deal with situations they have\nnever yet really seen. For the uplifting of men and for the great social\ntask of this our day we need ideas, and enthusiasm, and all sorts of\nresource; but most of all, and first of all, we need vision. And the man\nwho goes farthest, and sees most, and does most, is 'he that goeth forth\nand weepeth.'\n\n\n\n\nVII.\n\nDELIVERANCE WITH HONOUR\n\n\n  He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him;\n  I will be with him in trouble:\n  I will deliver him, and honour him.\n  With long life will I satisfy him,\n  And show him My salvation.\n\n  Ps. xci. 15, 16.\n\n_He shall call upon Me._ He shall need Me. He shall not be able to live\nwithout Me. As the years pass over his head he shall learn that there is\none need woven into human life larger and deeper and more abiding than any\nother need--and that need is God. Thus doth divinity prophesy concerning\nhumanity. Thus doth infinite foresight predict a man's need.\n\nWe peer in our purblind fashion into the future and try to anticipate our\nneeds. We fence ourselves in with all sorts of fancied securities, and then\nwe comfort ourselves with the shrewdness and completeness of our\nforecasting and provision-making. And sometimes it is just folly with a\ngrave face. 'He shall call upon Me.' A man has learned nothing until he has\nlearned that he needs God. And we take a long time over that lesson. It has\nsometimes to be beaten into us--written in conscience and heart by the\nfinger of pain. How the little storehouse of life has to be almost stripped\nof its treasures, how our faith in the things of the hour has to be played\nwith and mocked, ere we call upon God in heaven to fill us with abiding\ntreasure and fold us in eternal love.\n\n_He shall call upon Me, and, I will answer him._ But I have called, says\none, and He has not answered. I called upon Him when my little child was\nsick unto death, and, spite my calling, the little white soul fluttered\nnoiselessly into the great beyond. My friend, you call that tiny green\nmound in the churchyard God's silence. Some day you will call it God's\nanswer. Our prayers are sometimes torn out of our hearts by the pain of the\nmoment. God's answers come forth from the unerring quiet of eternity. 'He\nshall call upon Me.' 'He shall ask Me to help him, but he does not know how\nhe can be helped. He is hedged about by a thousand limitations of thought.\nHis life is full of distortions. He cannot distinguish between a blessing\nand a curse. I cannot heed the dictations of his prayers, but I will answer\nhim.' This is the voice of Him to whom the ravelled complexities of men's\nminds are simplicity itself; who dwells beyond the brief bewilderments and\nmistaken desirings and false ideals of men's hearts.\n\nOh these divine answers! How they confuse us! It is their perfection that\nbewilders us; it is their completeness that carries them beyond our\ncomprehension.\n\nThere is the stamp of the local and the temporary on all our asking. The\nanswer that comes is wider than life and longer than time, and fashioned\nafter a completeness whereof we do not even dream.\n\n_I will be with him in trouble._ Trouble is that in life which becomes to\nus a gospel of tears, a ministry of futility. This is because we have\ngrasped the humanity of the word and missed the divinity of it. We are\nalways doing that. Always gathering the meaning of the moments and missing\nthe meaning of the years. Always smarting under the sharp discipline and\nmissing the merciful design: 'With Him in trouble.' That helps me to\nbelieve in my religion. Trouble is the test of the creeds. A fig for the\northodoxy that cannot interpret tears! Write vanity upon the religion that\nis of no avail in the house of sorrow. When the earthly song falls on\nsilence we are disposed to call it a pitiable silence. Not so. Let us say a\ndivinely opportune silence, for when the many voices grow dumb the One\nVoice speaks: 'I will be with him in trouble,' and the man who has lost the\neverything that is nothing only to find the one thing that is all knows\nwhat that promise means.\n\n_I will deliver him._ What a masterful, availing, victorious presence is\nthis! How this promise goes out beyond our human ministries of consolation!\nHow often the most we can do is to walk by our brother's side whilst he\nbears a burden we cannot share! How often the earthly sympathy is just a\ncommunion of sad hearts--one weak hand holding another! 'I will deliver\nhim.' That is not merely sympathy, it is victory. The divine love does not\nmerely condole, it delivers.\n\nYou cannot add anything to this promise. It is complete. The time of the\ndeliverance is there, the manner of it is there, the whole ministry of help\nis there. You say you cannot find anything about time and manner. You can\nonly find the bare promise of deliverance. My friend, there are no bare\npromises in the lips of the Heavenly Father. In the mighty, merciful\nleisure of omnipotence, in the perfect fitness of things, in a way wiser\nthan his thinking and better than his hoping and larger than his prayer, 'I\nwill deliver him.'\n\n_And honour him._ It will be no scanty, obscure, uncertain deliverance.\nThere shall be light in it, glory in it. The world battles with its\ntroubles and seems sometimes to be successful, until we see how those\ntroubles have shaken its spirit and twisted its temper; and see, too, how\nmuch of the beautiful and the strong and the sweet has been lost in the\nfight. 'I will deliver him' with an abundant and an honourable\ndeliverance--he shall come forth from his tribulations more noble, tender,\nand self-possessed. Hereafter there shall be given him the honour of one\nwhom the stress of life has driven into the arms of God.\n\nOh how we miss this ministry of ennoblement! We reap a harvest of\ninsignificance from the seeds of sorrow sown in our hearts. We let our\ncares dishonour us. The little cares rasp and fret and sting the manliness\nand the womanliness and the godlikeness out of us. And the great cares\ncrush us earthward till there is scarcely a sweet word left in our lips or\na noble thought in our heart. A man cannot save his _soul_ in the day of\ntrouble. He cannot by himself make good the wear and tear of anxieties and\ngriefs. He can hold his head high and hide his secret deep, but he cannot\nkeep his life sweet. Only Christ can teach a man how to find the nameless\ndignity of the crown of thorns. The kingship of suffering is a secret in\nthe keeping of faith and love. If a man accepts this deliverance of his God\nfolded in flashes of understanding, ministries of explanation, revivals of\nfaith, and gifts of endurance, he shall find the honour that is to be won\namong life's hard and bitter things.\n\n_With long life will I satisfy him, and show him My salvation._ We have\nseen a grey-headed libertine, and we have missed from among the\nclean-hearted and the faithful some brave young life that was giving itself\nvigorously to the holy service. But perhaps we have had the grace not to\nchallenge the utter faithfulness of God. The measure of life is not written\non a registrar's certificates of birth and death. There is something here\nthat lies beyond dates and documents. Life here and hereafter is one, and\ndeath is but an event in it. Who lives to God lives long, be his years many\nor few. It is reasonable to expect some relationship between godliness and\nlongevity. But we are nearer the truth when we see how that faith and\nprayer discover and secure the eternal values of fleeting days.\n\n_And show him My salvation._ That is the whole text summed up in one\nphrase. That is the life of the godly man gathered into the compass of the\ndivine promise. For every one who goes the way of faith and obedience, life\nin every phase of it, life here and hereafter, means but one thing and\nholds but one thing, and that is _the salvation of the Lord_.\n\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\nPETITION AND COMMUNION\n\n\n  Hear me speedily, O Lord....\n  Cause me to hear ...\n  For I lift up my soul unto Thee.\n\n  Ps. cxliii. 7, 8.\n\nYou will notice that the first verse begins 'Hear me,' and the second\nbegins 'Cause me to hear'; and the second is greater than the first. Let us\nlook, then, at these two attitudes of a man in his hour of prayer.\n\n_Hear me._ The Psalmist began, where all men must begin, with himself. He\nhad something to utter in the hearing of the Almighty. He had something to\nlay before his God--a story, a confession, a plea. His heart was full, and\nmust outpour itself into the ear of Heaven. 'Hear me speedily, O Lord.' We\nhave all prayed thus. We have all faced some situation that struck a note\nof urgency in our life, and all your soul has come to our lips in this one\ncry that went up to the Father, 'Hear me.' A sudden pain, a surprise of\nsorrow, a few moments of misty uncertainty in the face of decisions that\nhad to be made at once, times when life has tried to rush us from our\nestablished position and to bear us we know not where--and our soul has\nreached out after God as simply and naturally as a man grasps at some fixed\nthing when he is falling.\n\nThere are times, too, when prayer is an indefinable relief. We all know\nsomething about the relief of speech. We must speak to somebody. Our need\nis not, first of all, either advice or practical help. We want a hearing.\nWe want some one to listen and sympathize. We want to share our pain. That\nis what 'Hear me' sometimes means. Whatever Thou shalt see fit to do for\nme, at least listen to my cry. Let me unburden my soul. Let me get this\nweight of silence off my heart. This fashion of relief is part of the true\noffice of prayer. Herein lies the reasonableness of telling our story in\nthe ear of One who knows that story better than we do. We need not inform\nthe All-knowing, but we must commune with the All-pitiful. We make our life\nknown unto God that we may make it bearable unto ourselves.\n\nBut let us look at the attitude of mind and heart revealed in this second\nposition, _Cause me to hear_. Now we are coming to the larger truth about\nprayer, and the deeper spirit of it. Prayer is not merely claiming a\nhearing; it is giving a hearing. It is not only speaking to God; it is\nlistening to God. And as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are the\nwords we hear greater than the words we speak. Let us not forget this. Let\nus not pauperize ourselves by our very importunity. Maybe we are vociferous\nwhen God is but waiting for a silence to fall in His earthly temples that\nHe may have speech with His children. We talk about 'prevailing prayer,'\nand there is a great truth in the phrase. All prayer does not prevail.\nThere is that among men which passes for prayer but has no spiritual grip,\nno assurance, no masterful patience, no fine desperation. There is a place\nfor all these things, and a need for them, in the life of prayer. We need\nthe courage of a great faith and the earnestness that is born of necessity.\nWe need to be able to lift up our faces toward heaven in the swelling joys\nand the startling perils of these mortal hours and cry, 'Hear me,' knowing\nthat God does hear us and that the outcrying of every praying heart rings\nclear and strong in the courts of the Heavenly King. But we need something\nmore; we need a very great deal more than this, if we are to enter into the\ntrue meaning of prevailing prayer. The final triumph of prayer is not ours;\nit is God's. When we are upon our knees before Him, it is He, and not we,\nthat must prevail. This is the true victory of faith and prayer, when the\nFather writes His purpose more clearly in our minds, lays His commandment\nmore inwardly upon our hearts. We do not get one faint glimpse into the\nmeaning of that mysterious conflict at Peniel until we see that the\nnecessity for the conflict lay in the heart of Jacob and not in the heart\nof God. The man who wrestled with the Angel and prevailed passes before us\nin the glow of the sunrise weary and halt, with a changed name and a\nchanged heart. So must it be with us; so shall it be, if ever we know what\nit is to prevail in prayer. Importunity must not become a blind and\nuninspired clamouring for the thing we desire. Such an attitude may easily\nset us beyond the possibility of receiving that which God knows we need. We\nmust not forget that our poor little plea for help and blessing does not\nexhaust the possibilities of prayer. Our words go upward to God's throne\ntwisted by our imperfect thinking, narrowed by our outlook, sterilized by\nthe doubts of our hearts, and we do not know what is good for us. His word\ncomes downward into our lives laden with the quiet certainty of the\nEternal, wide as the vision of Him who seeth all, deep as the wisdom of Him\nwho knoweth all.\n\nSo, however much it may be to say 'Hear me,' it is vastly more to say\n'Cause me to hear.' However much I have to tell Him, He has more to tell\nme. This view of prayer will help to clear up for us some of the\ndifficulties that have troubled many minds. We hear people speak of\nunanswered prayer; but there is no such thing, and in the nature of things\nthere cannot be. I do not mean by that, that to every prayer there will\ncome a response some day. To every prayer there is a response now. In our\nconfused and mechanical conception of the God to whom we pray, we separate\nbetween His hearing and His answering. We identify the answer to prayer\nwith the granting of a petition. But prayer is more than petition. It is\nnot our many requests, it is an attitude of spirit. We grant readily that\nour words are the least important part of our prayers. But very often the\npetitions we frame and utter are no part of our prayers at all. They are\nnot prayer, yet uttering them we may pray a prayer that shall be heard and\nanswered, for every man who truly desires in prayer the help of God for his\nlife receives that help there and then, though the terms in which he\ndescribes his need may be wholly wide of the truth as God knows it. So the\nreal answer to prayer is God's response to man's spiritual attitude, and\nthat response is as complete and continuous as the attitude will allow it\nto be. The end of prayer is not to win concessions from Almighty Power, but\nto have communion with Almighty Love.\n\n'Cause me to hear'; make a reverent, responsive, receptive silence in my\nheart, take me out beyond my pleadings into the limitless visions and the\nfathomless satisfactions of communion with Thyself. Speak to me. That is\ntrue prayer.\n\n  In the quietness of life,\n  When the flowers have shut their eye,\n  And a stainless breadth of sky\n  Bends above the hill of strife,\n  Then, my God, my chiefest Good,\n  Breathe upon my lonelihood:\n  Let the shining silence be\n  Filled with Thee, my God, with Thee.\n\n\n\n\nIX.\n\nHAUNTED HOURS\n\n\n  Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil,\n  when iniquity at my heels compasseth me about?\n\n  Ps. xlix. 5.\n\nIniquity _at my heels_. Temptation is very often indirect. It is compact of\nwiles and subtleties and stratagems. It is adept at taking cover. It does\nnot make a frontal attack unless the obvious state of the soul's defences\njustifies such a method of attempting a conquest. The stronger a man is,\nthe more subtle and difficult are the ways of sin, as it seeks to enter and\nto master his life. There are many temptations that never face us, and\nnever give us a chance of facing them. They follow us. We can hear their\nlight footfall and their soft whisperings, but the moment we turn round\nupon them they vanish. If they disappeared for good, they would be the\neasiest to deal with of all the ill things that beset our lives. But they\ndo not. The moment we relax our bold, stern search for the face of the\nenemy, there the evil thing is again--the light footfall and the soft\nvoice. It is terrible work fighting a suggestion. There are the thoughts\nthat a man will not cherish and cannot slay. They may never enter the\nprogramme of his life, but there they are, haunting him, waiting, so to\nspeak, at the back of his brain, till he gets used to them. When he seeks\nto grapple with these enemies his hands close on emptiness. One straight\nblow, one decisive denial, one stern rebuke, one defiant confession of\nfaith will not suffice for these things. They compass a man's heels. He\ncannot trample them down. The fashion of the evils that compass us\ndetermines the form of the fight we wage with them. Preparations that might\namply suffice the city in the day when an army with banners comes against\nit are no good at all if a plague has to be fought. So there is a way we\nhave to take with 'the iniquity at our heels.' It calls for much patience\nand much prayer. If we cannot prevent sin from following us, we can at\nleast prevent ourselves from turning and following it. A man can always\nchoose his path if he cannot at every moment determine his company. And as\na man goes onward and upward steadfastly toward the City of Light, the evil\nthings fall off and drop behind, and God shall bring him where no evil\nthing dare follow, and where no ravenous beast shall stalk its prey.\n\nThe battle with sin is not an incident in the Christian life; it is the\nabiding condition of it. While there are some temptations that we have to\nslay, there are others we have to outgrow. They are overcome, not by any\none supreme assertion of the will, but by the patient cultivation of all\nthe loftiest and most wholesome and delicate and intensely spiritual modes\nof feeling and of being.\n\nAgain, let me suggest that iniquity at our heels is sometimes an old sin in\na new form. You remember the difficulty that Hiawatha had in hunting down\nPau-puk Keewis. That mischievous magician assumed the form of a beaver,\nthen that of a bird, then that of a serpent; and though each in turn was\nslain, the magician escaped and mocked his pursuer. Surely a parable of our\nstrife with sin. We smite it in one form and it comes to life in another.\nOne day a man is angry--clenched fingers and hot words. He conquers his\nanger; but the next day there is a spirit of bitterness rankling in his\nheart, and maybe a tinge of regret that he did not say and do more when his\nheart was hot within him and fire was on his lips. The sin he faced and\nfought yesterday has become iniquity at his heels. Having failed to knock\nhim down, it tries to trip him up. Maybe many waste their energies trying\nto deal with the _forms_ of sin, and never grapple with the _fact_ of sin.\nHence the evil things that compass men's souls about with their dread\nministries of suggestion, and flutter on unhallowed wings in the wake of\nlife. The sin that confronts us reveals to us our need of strength, but the\nsin that dogs our steps has, maybe, a deeper lesson to teach us--even our\nneed of heart-deep holiness. Good resolution will do much to clear the path\nahead, but only purity of character can rid us of the persistent haunting\nperil of the sin that plucks at the skirt of life. The deliverance God\noffers to the struggling soul covers not only the hour of actual grappling\nwith the foe, but all the hours when it is the stealth and not the strength\nof evil that we most have cause to fear.\n\n_Iniquity at my heels._ These words remind us that sin is not done with\nafter it is committed. God forgives sin, but He does not obliterate all its\nconsequences, either in our own lives or in the lives of others. A man may\nhave the light of the City of God flashing in his face, and a whole host of\nshameful memories and bitter regrets crowding at his heels. We do not know\nwhat sin is till we turn our backs on it. Then we find its tenacity and its\nentanglement. What would we not give if only we could leave some things\nbehind us! What would we not do if only we could put a space between\nourselves and our past! The fetters of evil habit may be broken, but their\nmarks are upon us, and the feet that bore the fetters go more slowly for\nthem many days. The hands that have been used to grasping and holding do\nnot open without an effort, even though the heart has at last learned that\nit is more blessed to give than to receive.\n\nYes, and our sins come to life again in the lives of others. The light word\nthat ought to have been a grave word and that shook another's good\nresolution, the cool word that ought to have been a warm word and that\nchilled a pure enthusiasm--we cannot have done with these things. Parents\nsometimes live to see their sins of indulgence or of neglect blighting the\nlives of those to whom they owed a debt of firmness and kindness. It is\niniquity at the heels. These passages of carelessness and unfaithfulness\nhaunt men, be their repentance never so bitter and their amendment never so\nsincere and successful. But all this is for discipline and not for despair.\nIt casts us back upon God's mercy. It keeps the shadow of the cross upon\nall our path. It has something to do with the making of 'a humble, lowly,\npenitent, and obedient heart.' The memory of the irreparable is a sorrow of\nthe saints.\n\n  Saint, did I say? With your remembered faces,\n    Dear men and women whom I sought and slew!\n  Ah, when we mingle in the heavenly places,\n    How will I weep to Stephen and to you!\n\nOnly let us not be afraid nor wholly cast down. Rather let us say,\n'Wherefore should I fear when the iniquity at my heels compasseth me\nabout?' By the grace of God the hours of the soul's sad memory and of\nclinging regrets shall mean unto us a ministry of humility and a passion of\nprayer. And through them God shall give us glimpses of the gateway of that\nlife where regret and shame and sorrow fall back unable to enter. There is\na place whither the iniquity at a man's heels can no longer follow him, and\nwhere in the perfect life the soul, at last, is able to forget.\n\n\n\n\nX.\n\nTHE WINGS OF THE DOVE\n\n\n  And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove!\n  Then would I fly away, and be at rest....\n  I would haste me to a shelter\n  From the stormy wind and tempest.\n\n  Ps. lv. 6, 8.\n\nThese words are the transcript of a mood. The writer is not unfolding to us\nany of the deep persistent longings of his spirit; he is telling us of a\nthought that shadowed his soul for an hour. Let us look into this mood of\nhis. It is not his in any unique or even peculiar sense. In moods, as in\nmanners, history is wont to repeat itself. The writer of this poem has\nvoiced one of the great common experiences of humanity. But let us be quite\nclear as to what that experience really is. Let us not be misled by the\nmusic and the seeming unworldliness of these words about winged flight from\na world of trouble and strife. The Psalmist was not looking heavenward, but\nearthward, when this plea for wings broke from his heart. He was moved to\nspeak as he did, not by the surpassing charm of a heavenly vision, but by\nthe dark unrest of the earthly outlook. The emphatic note here is that of\ndeparture, not of destination. It is necessary to remind ourselves that\nthis is so, for these words have become the classic of the home-sick soul.\nThey have been used to voice the farthest and most truly divine desires of\nthe human heart. And by virtue of such use they have gathered a meaning\nwhich was not theirs at the beginning. At that meaning we will presently\nlook, but let us first of all look at this longing as it stands in the\npsalm and as it represents an experience that is threaded through the\nhistory of humanity.\n\n_Oh that I had wings ... then would I fly away._ Here the idea of fleeing\naway suggests itself as a possible solution of life; and whenever it comes\nto a man like this it is a source of weakness. It is not a desire to find\nthe joys of heaven; it is a desire to escape the pains of earth. There is\nno vista, no wistful distance, no long, alluring prospect. The soul is\nhemmed in by its enemies, crushed down by its burdens, beset on all sides\nby the frets of the earthly lot; and there comes a vague desire to be out\nof it all. It is not aspiration, it is evasion. It is not response to the\nideal, it is recoil from the actual. It is not the spell of that which\nshall be that is upon the soul, but the irksomeness or the dreadfulness of\nthat which is. This is a mood that awaits us all. No man faces life as it\nshould be faced, but some can hardly be said to face it at all. Their face\nis ever turned towards a seductive vision of quietness. The solution of\nlife for them is not in a fight, but in a retreat. Of course we know there\nis no going back, and no easy deliverance from the burden and the battle,\nbut in the thick of any fight there is a great difference between the man\nwho wants victory and the man who merely wants a cessation of hostilities.\n\nThis plea for wings does not necessarily betoken 'a desire to depart.' It\nrather indicates a desire to remain under more favourable and comfortable\nconditions. Such a mood is not the highest and the healthiest experience of\nthe soul. It is rather something against which we must fight relentlessly.\nVery often the longing for wings results only in lagging footsteps.\nPicturing to ourselves the luxury of laying life down will not help us to\nface the duty of taking life up. The secret of enervation is found not in\nthe poverty of our resources, but in the cowardliness and selfishness of\nour attitude towards life. The battle is half won when we have looked the\nenemy in the face. The burden is the better borne as we stoop under the\nfull weight of it.\n\n_Oh that I had wings like a dove!_ That is a short-sighted and a selfish\ndesire. Supposing you had wings, what would you do? Fly away from the moil\nof the world and find rest and shelter for yourself? Is that the best and\nnoblest thing to desire to do? After all, we know other and loftier moods\nthan this. We know that staying is better than going when there is so much\nto stay for. We know that working is better than resting when there is so\nmuch to do. We have something better to think about than a quiet lodgement\nin the wilderness, we who live in a world where the strength of our hands\nand the warmth of our hearts count for something. To give your tired\nbrother a lift is a vastly more profitable occupation than sitting at the\nroadside and wishing you could fly. Man, you ought to be glad that you can\nwalk--in a world where there are so many cripples that want help.\n\n_Oh that I had wings!... then would I fly away._ That desire has never\ntaken any one to heaven, but it has made them less useful upon earth. The\nbreath of this desire is able to blight the flowers of social service. No\none would be foolish enough to indict suburbanism as a mode of life. The\nday must surely come when few or none will dwell in the smoke-grimed heart\nof the city. But in as far as a man seeks the fairest suburb open to him in\norder that he may see little of, and think little of, 'the darkness of the\nterrible streets,' then the very life that restores health to his body\nshall sow seeds of disease in his soul.\n\nThere is only one way to rest, and that lies right through the heart of the\nworld's work and pain. Rest is not for those who flee away from life's\ndifficulties, but for those who face them. 'Take my yoke ... and ye shall\nfind rest.' It were not well for our own sakes that we had wings. It were\nnot well for us to be able to avoid the burden-bearing and the tale of\ntired days, for God has hidden the secret of our rest in the heart of our\ntoiling. They who come unto the City of God come there not by the easy\nflight of a dove, but by the long, slow pilgrimage of unselfishness.\n\nYet there is a beauty and a fitness in this longing. It is expressive of\nmore than the weariness of a world-worn spirit, or the thinly disguised\nselfishness of one who fears to pay the price of life.\n\nWhen the long working-day of life is wearing away its last hours and\nverging towards the great stillness, the voices of time fall but faintly on\nthe ear, the adorations and ideals and fashions and enthusiasms of the\nworld come to mean little to a man who in his day has followed them as\neagerly as any, and the heart within him asks only for rest.\n\n  God, if there be none beside Thee\n    Dwelling in the light,\n  Take me out of the world and hide me\n    Somewhere behind the night.\n\nWhen, like Simeon the seer with the Christ-Child in his arms, a man feels\nthat for him life has said its last word and shown its last wonder and\nuttered its last benediction, the desire for rest is a pure and spiritually\nnormal thing; it is just the soul's gaze turned upward where\n\n            beyond these toils\n      God waiteth us above,\n  To give to hand and heart the spoils\n      Of labour and of love.\n\nAnd maybe this mood of which we are thinking may have a not unworthy place\nin a strenuous life. As a tired woman pauses amid her tasks and looks out\nof her cottage window to take into her heart the quiet beauty of the woods\nwhere she knows the ground is fair with lilies, so do we find ourselves\nlooking out of life's small casement and thinking upon the fresh, free,\n'outdoor' life the soul will some day live. And such a mood as this is\nsurely a sign of the soul's growth, a testimony of its responsiveness to\nthe divine touch, a sudden sense of its splendid destiny borne in upon it\namong the grey and narrow circumstances of its service.\n\n  Oh that I had a dove's swift, silver wings,\n  I said, so I might straightway leave behind\n  This strife of tongues, this tramp of feet, and find\n  A world that knows no struggles and no stings,\n  Where all about the soul soft Silence flings\n  Her filmy garment, and the vexèd mind\n  Grows quiet as there floats upon the wind\n  The soothing slumber-song of dreamless things.\n  And lo! there answered me a voice and said,\n  Man, thou hast hands and heart, take back thy prayer;\n  Covet life's weariness, go forth and share\n  The common suffering and the toil for bread.\n  Look not on Rest, although her face be fair,\n  And her white hands shall smooth thy narrow bed.\n\n\n\n\nXI.\n\nA NEW SONG\n\n\n  O sing unto the Lord a new song.\n\n  Ps. xcvi. 1.\n\nTime and again in the Psalter we find this appeal for a new song. First of\nall, and most obviously, the appeal concerns the contents of the song. It\nreminds us of the duty of making our grateful acknowledgement of God's\ngoodness to us expand with our growing experience of that goodness. It is,\nif, one may so phrase it, a reminder to us that our praise needs bringing\nup to date. A hymn considerably later in date than this psalm exhorts us to\n'count' our 'blessings,' and to 'name them one by one.' This exhortation to\nattempt the impossible is perhaps more worthy of being heeded than the form\nin which it is presented to us might lead some to suppose. There is no\ngetting away from the simple fact that a man's thankfulness has a real and\nproportionate relationship to the things for which he has cause to be\nthankful. If in our daily life the phrase 'the goodness of God' is to have\na deepening and cumulative significance, it must be informed and vitalized\ncontinually by an alert and responsive recognition of the forms in which\nthat goodness is ever freshly manifested to us. Whilst the roots of the\ntree of praise lie deep beneath the surface, and wind their thousand ways\ninto dim places where memory itself cannot follow them, yet surely the\nleaves of the tree are fresher and greener for rain that even now has left\nits reviving touch upon them, and for the sunshine that is even now\nstirring the life in all their veins. The figure is imperfect. We are not\ntrees. We do not respond automatically to all the gracious and cheering\nministries of the Eternal Goodness in our lives. We may easily overlook\nmany a good gift of our God. And though in our forgetfulness and\nunthankfulness we profit by the sunlight and the dew and by each tender\nthought of God for His creatures, yet the full and perpetual profit of all\ngood things is for each of us bound up with the power to see them, the\nwisdom to appraise them, the mindfulness that holds them fast, and the\nheart that sings out its thanksgiving for them. 'O sing unto the Lord a new\nsong.' Bring this day's life into the song. Bring the gift that has come to\nthee this very hour into the song. Look about thee. See if there be but one\nmore flower springing at the path-side. See if the bud of yesterday has but\nunfolded another leaf. Behold the loaf on thy table, feel the warmth of thy\nhearth, yea, feel the very life within thee that woke again and stirred\nitself with the morning light, and say these gifts are like unto the gifts\nof yesterday, but they are not yesterday's gifts. Yesterday's bread is\nbroken, and yesterday's fire is dead, and yesterday's strength is spent. O\nGod, Thy mercies are new every morning! So shall a new song break from the\nheart.\n\nIt is quite possible, in taking what we believe to be a broad view of life,\nto overlook many of the things that go to make life. Too much generalizing\nmakes for a barren heart. The specific has a vital place in the ministry of\npraise. It is true that the highest flights of praise always carry the soul\nbeyond any conscious reckoning with the details of its experience.\nTabulation is not the keystone of the arch of thanksgiving. But to behold\nthe specific goodness of God in each day's life, to review the hours and to\nsay to one's own soul, Thus and thus hath my God been mindful of me, is\nperhaps the surest and the simplest way to deepen and vitalize the habit of\npraise in our life, and to set the new notes ringing in our psalm of\nthanksgiving.\n\nBut in this appeal for a new song of praise to God there is something more\nthan a recognition of new blessings. The new song is not merely the\nresponse to new mercies and the tuneful celebration of recent good. If\nthere is to be ever a new note in the song, there must be ever a new note\nin the singer's heart. And this cometh not by observation, but by\ninspiration. You may change the words of the song and it may still be the\nold song. You may sing the same words and it may yet be a new song. For as\nis the singer, so is the song.\n\n_O sing unto the Lord a new song._ That is a plea for a deeper and a wider\nlife. It is a plea that sounds the depth of the heart and takes the measure\nof the soul. The new song comes not of a truer enumeration of life's\nblessings, but of a truer understanding of the blessedness of life itself.\nThe key to such understanding is character. When by the grace of the clean\nheart and the enlightened and responsive spirit a man can get beneath the\nevents of each day's life and commune with that eternal law of love to\nwhich each one of those events bears some relation--or had we not better\nsay commune with the Eternal Father by whom that law exists?--then is his\nsong of praise ever new. It is something to catch a glimpse of the mercy of\nGod, and to think and feel as one has not thought or felt before about some\npart of life's daily good. But it is vastly more to learn to interpret the\nwhole of life in the terms of the goodness of God. The saint sings where\nthe worldling sighs. And if we find in that song only the apotheosis of\ncourage and resignation, we have neither found the source of the song nor\nthe message of it. The new song comes not from the thrill of peril faced\nand defied, nor from the victorious acceptance of hard and bitter things.\nIt comes from that deep life of the soul in God, a life beyond the threat\nof peril and beyond the touch of pain. It finds its deepest and freshest\nnotes not in contemplating the new gains and good of any day, but in a\ngrowing sense of the timeless gain and eternal good of every day.\n\nAnd if all this be so, it surely follows that the service of praise is not\nsomething unto which we may pass by one effort of the will or that depends\nupon the stimulus of outward experience. It is conditioned rather by our\ncharacter, and by our power to see the unveiled face of life reflecting\nalways the light of perfect love. And it is to produce in us the right\ncharacter and the true insight that God disciplines us all our days. It is\nto set a new song in our hearts. Said a professor of music at Leipzig of a\ngirl whom he had trained for some years and who was the pride of the\nConservatoire, 'If only some one would marry her and ill-treat her and\nbreak her heart she would be the finest singer in Europe.' He missed\nsomething in the song, and knew it could never come there save from the\nheart of the singer. Trouble always strikes a new note in life, and often\nthe deepest note that is ever struck. But, be our experience joyous or\nsorrowful, the true end of it must ever be to deepen our own hearts that\nthere may be in us ever a more catholic recognition of, and response to,\nthe Eternal Love.\n\nThe human soul is not a mere repository of experiences. Memory is not the\ntrue guardian of life's treasure. That treasure is invested in character.\nIn the moral world we _have_ what we _are_. So we may recall that which we\nhave never possessed, and may possess that which we can never recall. And\nit is out of that which we have _become_ by God's grace, rather than out of\nthat which we have received of that grace, that the new song comes.\n\nSo, as day by day we pray for the grace of new thanksgiving, we are seeking\nsomething more than a new power to behold what good things each day brings\nus, a readier way of reckoning the wealth of the passing hours. We are\nseeking for a larger life in God, and for a spirit able, as it were, to\nsecrete from every experience its hidden meed of everlasting blessing. For\nif the heart grow purer, the will stronger, the vision clearer, the\njudgement truer--indeed, if there come to the soul each day some increase\nof life--it shall surely find its way into living praise. And a living song\nis always a new song.",

    "text": "THE IDLER IN FRANCE\n\nBy MARGUERITE GARDINER, THE COUNTESS OF BLESSINGTON\n\n1841.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nNISMES.\n\nI have omitted to notice the route to this place, having formerly\ndescribed the greater portion of it. I remarked a considerable\nimprovement in the different towns we passed through: the people look\ncleaner, and an air of business has replaced the stagnation that used\nto prevail, except in Marseilles and Toulon, which were always busy\ncities.\n\nNismes surpasses my expectations, although they had been greatly\nexcited, and amply repays the long _détour_ we have made to visit it.\n\nWhen I look round on the objects of antiquity that meet my eye on every\nside, and above all on the Amphitheatre and _Maison Carrée_, I am\nforced to admit that Italy has nothing to equal the two last: for if\nthe Coliseum may be said to surpass the amphitheatre in dimensions, the\nwonderful state of preservation of the latter renders it more\ninteresting; and the _Maison Carrée_, it must be allowed, stands\nwithout a competitor. Well might the Abbé Barthélemy, in his _Voyage\nd'Anacharsis_, call it the masterpiece of ancient architecture and the\ndespair of modern!\n\nThe antiquities of Nismes have another advantage over those of Italy:\nthey are kept wholly free from the disgusting _entourage_ that impairs\nthe effect of the latter; and in examining them in the interior or\nexterior, no risk is incurred of encountering aught offensive to the\nolfactory nerves, or injurious to the _chaussure_.\n\nWe devoted last evening to walking round the town, and so cloudless was\nthe sky, so genial the air, and so striking the monuments of Roman\nsplendour, that I could have fancied myself again transported to Italy.\n\nOur inn, the Hôtel du Midi, is an excellent one; the apartments good,\nand the _cuisine soignée_. In this latter point the French hôtels are\nfar superior to the Italian; but in civility and attention, the hosts\nof Italy have the advantage.\n\nWe had no sooner dined than half-a-dozen persons, laden with silk\nhandkerchiefs and ribands, brocaded with gold and silver, and silk\nstockings, and crapes, all the manufacture of Nismes, came to display\ntheir merchandise. The specimens were good, and the prices moderate; so\nwe bought some of each, much to the satisfaction of the parties\nselling, and also of the host, who seemed to take a more than common\ninterest in the sale, whether wholly from patriotic feelings or not, I\nwill not pretend to say.\n\nThe _Maison Carrée_, of all the buildings of antiquity I have yet seen,\nis the one which has most successfully resisted the numerous assaults\nof time, weather, Vandalism, and the not less barbarous attacks of\nthose into whose merciless hands it has afterwards fallen. In the early\npart of the Christian ages it was converted into a church, and\ndedicated to St.-Étienne the Martyr; and in the eleventh century it was\nused as the Hôtel-de-Ville. It was then given to a certain Pierre Boys,\nin exchange for a piece of ground to erect a new hôtel-de-ville; and\nhe, after having degraded it by using a portion of it as a party-wall\nto a mean dwelling he erected adjoining it, disposed of it to a *Sieur\nBruyes, who, still more barbarous than Pierre Boys, converted it into a\nstable. In 1670, it was purchased by the Augustin monks from the\ndescendants of Bruyes, and once more used as a church; and, in 1789, it\nwas taken from the Augustin monks for the purposes of the\nadministration of the department. From that period, every thing has\nbeen done for its preservation. Cleared from the mean houses which had\nbeen built around it, and enclosed by an iron palisade, which protects\nit from mischievous hands, it now stands isolated in the centre of a\nsquare, or _place_, where it can be seen at every side. Poldo\nd'Albenas, a quaint old writer, whose book I glanced over to-day,\nattributes the preservation of the _Maison Carrée_ to the fortunate\nhoroscope of the spot on which it stands. His lamentations for the\ninsults offered to this building are really passionate.\n\nThe _Maison Carrée_ is not square, though its denomination might lead\none to suppose it to be so, being nearly eighty feet long, and only\nthirty-eight feet wide. Elevated on a base of cut stone, it is ascended\nby a flight of steps, which extends the length of the base in front.\nThe walls of the building are of a fine white stone, and are admirably\nconstructed.\n\nThe edifice has thirty fluted columns, with Corinthian capitals\nbeautifully sculptured, on which rests the architrave, with frieze and\ncornice. This last is ornamented with sculpture; and the frieze, with\nfoliage finely executed.\n\nThe entrance is by a portico, open on three sides, and supported by two\ncolumns, included in the thirty already named, of which six form the\nfront, and extend to the fourth, when commences the wall of the\nbuilding, in which the other columns are half imbedded, being united in\nthe building with its architrave. The fronton, which is over the\nportico, has no ornament in the centre; neither has the frieze nor\narchitrave: but some holes mark where the bronze letters of an\ninscription were once inserted.\n\nThis inscription has been conjectured, by the ingenious mode of placing\non paper the exact dimensions of the holes which formerly contained the\nletters of it, and is now said to be as follows:--\n\n     C. CÆSARI AUGUSTI. F. COS. L. CÆSARI AUGUSTI F. COS.\n     DESIGNATO PRINCIPIBUS JUVENTUTES.\n\nBut as more holes are found than would be filled by these letters, the\nconclusion does not seem to me to be justified.\n\nAt the far end of the portico is the door of entrance, the only opening\nby which light is admitted to the building. It is very lofty, and on\neach side is a pilaster; beneath the cornice are two long cut stones,\nwhich advance like a kind of architrave, pierced by a square hole of\nabove twelve inches, supposed to have been intended to support a bronze\ndoor.\n\nThe original destination of this beautiful edifice still furnishes a\nsubject for discussion among the antiquaries; some asserting it to have\nbeen erected by the Emperor Adrian in honour of Plotina, while others\nmaintain it to have been a forum.\n\nAt present, it is used as a museum for the antiquities discovered at\nNismes, and contains some admirable specimens. Among these are a torso\nin marble of a Roman knight, in a cuirass, and another colossal torso,\nwith a charming little draped statue seated in a curule chair, and\nholding a cornucopia in the left hand; a cinerary monument, enriched\nwith bassi-relievi, representing a human sacrifice; a bronze head of\nApollo, much injured; and a Janus.\n\nA funereal monument found in the neighbourhood of Nismes in 1824,\noffers a very interesting object, being in a good state of\npreservation. It is richly decorated, and by the inscription is proved\nto have been that of Marcus Attius, aged twenty-five years, erected to\nhim by his mother Coelia, daughter of Sextus Paternus.\n\nSo fine is the proportion, so exquisite is the finish, and so wonderful\nis the preservation of the _Maison Carrée_, that I confess I had much\nmore pleasure in contemplating its exterior, than in examining all that\nit contains, though many of these objects are well worth inspection.\n\nI should like to have a small model of it executed in silver, as an\nornament for the centre of a table; but it would require the hand of a\nmaster to do justice to the olive leaves of the capitals of the\ncolumns; that is, if they were faithfully copied from the original.\n\nIt was, if I remember rightly, Cardinal Alberoni who observed that this\nbeautiful building ought to be preserved in a golden _étui_, and its\ncompactness and exquisite finish prove that the implied eulogium was\nnot unmerited.\n\nI have nowhere else noticed the introduction of olive leaves in\nCorinthian capitals instead of those of the acanthus; the effect of\nwhich is very good. A design was once formed of removing the _Maison\nCarrée_ to Versailles. Colbert was the originator of this barbarous\nproject, which, however, was fortunately abandoned from the fear of\nimpairing, if not destroying, the beauty of the building. The Emperor\nNapoleon is said to have entertained a similar notion, and meant to\ngrace Paris with this model of architectural perfection; but it was\nfound to be too solidly built to admit of removal, and he who could\nshake empires, could not stir the _Maison Carrée_.\n\nThe transportation of antiquities from their original site can never be\nexcused, except in cases where it was the only means of insuring their\npreservation. All the power of association is lost when they are\ntransferred to other places; and the view of them ceases to afford that\nsatisfaction experienced when beheld where they were primarily destined\nto stand. I can no more fancy the _Maison Carrée_ appropriately placed\nin the bustle and gaiety of Paris, than I could endure to see one of\nthe temples at Pæstum stuck down at Charing Cross.\n\nOne loves, when contemplating such precious memorials of antiquity, to\nlook around on the objects in nature, still wearing the same aspect as\nwhen they were reared. The hills and mountains, unlike the productions\nof man, change not; and nowhere can the fragments of a bygone age\nappear to such advantage as on the spots selected for their erection,\nwhere their vicinity to peculiar scenery had been taken into\nconsideration.\n\nWe spent a considerable time in examining the Amphitheatre, and so well\nis it preserved, that one can hardly bring one's self to believe that\nso many centuries have elapsed since it was built; and that generation\nafter generation has passed away, who have looked on this edifice which\nnow meets my view, so little changed by the ravages of that ruthless\nconqueror Time, or the still more ruthless Visigoths who converted it\ninto a citadel, flanking the eastern door with two towers. In 737\nCharles Martel besieged the Saracens, and set fire to it, and after\ntheir expulsion it continued to be used as a citadel.\n\nThe form of this fine building is elliptical, and some notion of its\nvast extent may be formed, when it is stated to have been capable of\ncontaining above 17,000 spectators.\n\nIts façade consists of two rows of porticoes, forming two galleries one\nover the other, composing sixty arcades, divided by the same number of\nTuscan pilasters in the first range, and of Doric columns in the upper,\nand an attic, which crowns all. Four principal doors, fronting the four\ncardinal points, open into the amphitheatre, divided at nearly equal\ndistances one from the other.\n\nThe attic has no arcades, pilasters, or columns; but a narrow ledge\nruns along it, which was probably used for the purpose of approaching\nthe projecting consoles, 120 in number, placed in couples at equal\ndistances between two columns, and pierced with a large hole, which\ncorresponds with a similar one in the cornice, evidently meant for\nsecuring the awnings used to prevent the spectators from being\ninconvenienced by the rain or sun.\n\nThese awnings did not extend to the arena, which was usually left open,\nbut were universally adopted in all the Roman amphitheatres, after\ntheir introduction by Q. Catullus. The vast extent and extraordinary\ncommodiousness of the amphitheatres erected by the Romans, prove not\nonly the love of the sports exhibited in them entertained by that\npeople, but the attention paid to their health and comfort by the\narchitects who planned these buildings. The numerous vomitories were\nnot amongst the least important of these comforts, securing a safe\nretreat from the theatre in all cases of emergency, and precluding\nthose fearful accidents that in our times have not infrequently\noccurred, when an alarm of fire has been given. The mode of\narrangements, too, saved the spectators from all the deleterious\nresults of impure air, while the velarium preserved them from the sun.\nBut not only were the spectators screened from too fervid heat, but\nthey could retreat at pleasure, in case of rain or storm, into the\ngalleries, where they were sheltered from the rain. Our superior\ncivilization and refinement have not led to an equal attention to\nsafety and comfort in the mode of our ingress and egress from theatres,\nor to their ventilation; but perhaps this omission may be accounted for\nby the difference of our habits from those of the Romans. Public\namusements were deemed as essential to their comfort, as the enjoyment\nof home is to ours; and, consequently, while we prefer home--and long\nmay we continue to do so--our theatres will not be either so vast or so\ncommodious as in those times and countries, where domestic happiness\nwas so much less understood or provided for.\n\nThe erection of this magnificent edifice is attributed to Vespasian,\nTitus, or Domitian, from a fragment of an inscription discovered here\nsome fourteen or fifteen years ago, of which the following is a\ntranscript:--\n\n     VII. TRI. PO.....\n\nAnd as only these three filled the consulate eight times since\nTiberius, in whose age no amphitheatre had been built in the Roman\nprovinces, to one of them is adjudged its elevation.\n\nCould I only remember one half the erudition poured forth on my addled\nbrain by the cicerone, I might fill several pages, and fatigue others\nnearly as much as he fatigued me; but I will have pity on my readers,\nand spare them the elaborate details, profound speculations, ingenious\nhypotheses, and archaiological lore that assailed me, and wish them,\nshould they ever visit Nismes, that which was denied me--a tranquil and\nuninterrupted contemplation of its interesting antiquities, free from\nthe verbiage of a conscientious cicerone, who thinks himself in duty\nbound to relate all that he has ever heard or read relative to the\nobjects he points out.\n\nEven now my poor head rings with the names of Caius and Lucius Cæsar,\nTiberius, Trajan, Adrian, Diocletian, and Heaven only knows how many\nother Roman worthies, to whom Nismes owes its attractions, not one of\nwhom did this learned Theban omit to enumerate.\n\nMany of the antiquities of Nismes, which we went over to-day, might\nwell command attention, were they not in the vicinity of two such\nremarkable and well-preserved monuments as the Amphitheatre and _Maison\nCarrée_.\n\nThe Gate of Augustus, which now serves as the entrance to the barracks\nof the gendarmerie, is worthy of inspection. It consists of four\narches--two of equal size, for the admittance of chariots and horsemen,\nand two less ones for pedestrians. The centres of the two larger arches\nare decorated by the head of a bull, in alto-relievo; and above each of\nthe smaller arches is a niche, evidently meant for the reception of a\nstatue.\n\nA Corinthian pilaster divides the larger arches from the less, and a\nsimilar one terminates the building on each side; while the two larger\narches are separated by a small Ionic column, which rests on a\nprojecting abutment whence the arches spring. The Gate of France has\nbut one arch, and is said to have been flanked by towers; of which,\nhowever, it has little vestige.\n\nThe inhabitants of Nismes seem very proud of its antiquities, and even\nthe humbler classes descant with much erudition on the subject. Most,\nif not all of them, have studied the guide-books, and like to display\nthe extent of their _savoir_ on the subject.\n\nThey evince not a little jealousy if any preference seems accorded to\nthe antiquities of Italy over those of their town; and ask, with an air\nof triumph, whether any thing in Italy can be compared with their\n_Maison Carrée_, expressing their wonder that so few English come to\nlook at it.\n\nLa Tour-Magne stands on the highest of the hills, at the base of which\nis spread the town. It is precisely in the state most agreeable to\nantiquaries, as its extreme dilapidation permits them to indulge those\nvarious conjectures and hypotheses relative to its original\ndestination, in which they delight. They see in their \"mind's eye\" all\nthese interesting works of antiquity, _not_ as they _really_ are, but\nas it pleases them to imagine they _once_ were; and, consequently, the\nless that actually remains on which to base their suppositions, the\nwider field have they for their favourite speculations.\n\nThis tower is said by some to have been intended for a lighthouse;\nothers assert it to have been a treasury; a third party declares it to\nbe the remains of a palace; and, last of all, it is assumed to have\nbeen a mausoleum.\n\nIts form, judging from what remains, must have been pyramidical,\ncomposed of several stages, forming octagons, retreating one above the\nother. It suffered much from Charles Martel in 737, who wished to\ndestroy it, owing to its offering a strong military position to the\nSaracens; and still more from the ravages of a certain Francis Trancat,\nto whom Henry IV granted permission to make excavations in the interior\nof it, on condition that three parts of the product should be given up\nto the royal coffer.\n\nThe result did not repay the trouble or expense; and one cannot help\nbeing rejoiced that it did not, as probably, had it been otherwise, the\nsuccess would have served as an incentive to destroy other buildings.\n\nIn the vicinity of the Tour-Magne are the fountain, terrace, and\ngarden, the last of which is well planted, and forms a very agreeable\npromenade for the inhabitants of Nismes. The fountain occupies the site\nof the ancient baths--many vestiges of which having been discovered\nhave been employed for this useful, but not tasteful, work.\n\nIt was not until the middle of the eighteenth century, that it was\nsuspected that the water which served to turn a mill in the immediate\nvicinity had been obstructed by the ruins which impeded its course.\nThis obstruction led to excavations, the result of which was the\ndiscovery of the remains of buildings, columns, statues, inscriptions,\nand fragments of rare marbles.\n\nThe obstructions being thus removed, and the town enriched by the\nprecious objects found, the persons to whom the direction of the\nexcavation was confided, instead of vigorously pursuing the task, were\ncontent with what they had already discovered, and once more closed up\nthe grave in which so many treasures of antiquity were still\ninterred--using many of the materials disinterred for the formation of\nthe terraces which now cover it.\n\nThe architect selected to execute this work was Philip Maréchal, an\nengineer, never previously employed, except in military architecture: a\nfact to which may be attributed the peculiar style that he has\nexhibited--bastions and trenches being adopted, instead of the usual\nand more appropriate forms generally used for terraces and canals.\n\nTo these are subjoined ornaments of the period in which the work was\ncompleted--the fitness of which is not more to HBO commended than that\nof the work itself: the whole offering a curious mixture of military\nand _rococo_ taste.\n\nIt was in the freshness of early morning that I, yesterday, again\nvisited the garden of the fountain and its fine chesnut trees and\nlaurel roses; the latter, growing in great luxuriance, looked\nbeautiful, the sun having not yet scorched them. The fountain, too, in\nits natural bed, which is not less than seventy-two French feet in\ndiameter, and twenty feet in depth, was pellucid as crystal, and\nthrough it the long leaves that nearly cover the gravel appeared green\nas emerald.\n\nThe hill above the fountain has been tastefully planted with evergreen\ntrees, which shade a delicious walk, formed to its summit.\n\nThis improvement to the appearance, as well as to the _agréments_, of\nNismes, is due to Monsieur d'Haussey[1], prefect, whose popularity is\nsaid to be deservedly acquired, by his unremitting attention to the\ninterests of the city, and his urbanity to its inhabitants.\n\nNismes is a gay town, if I may judge by the groups of well-dressed\nwomen and men we have observed at the promenade.\n\nIt has a considerable garrison, and the officers are occasionally seen\npassing and repassing; but not, as I have often remarked in England,\nlazily lounging about as if anxious to kill time, but moving briskly as\nif on business.\n\nThe various accomplishments acquired by young men in France offer a\ngreat resource in country quarters. Drawing, in which most of them have\nattained a facility, if not excellence, enables them to fill albums\nwith clever sketches; and their love of the fine arts leads them to\ndevote some hours in most days to their cultivation.\n\nThis is surely preferable to loitering in news-rooms, sauntering in the\nshops of pretty milliners, breaking down the fences of farmers, or\nriding over young wheat--innocent pastimes, sometimes undertaken by\nyoung officers for mere want of some occupation.\n\nThe Temple of Diana is in the vicinity of the fountain, which has given\nrise to the conjecture that it originally constituted a portion of the\nancient baths. Its shape is rectangular, and a large opening in the\ncentre forms the entrance.\n\nTwelve niches, five of which open into the partition of the temple, and\ntwo on the right and left of the entrance, are crowned by frontons\nalternately circular and triangular, and are said to have contained\nstatues. This is one of the most picturesque ruins I ever saw. Silence\nand solitude reign around it, and wild fig-trees enwreath with their\nluxuriant foliage the opening made by Time, and half conceal the wounds\ninflicted by barbarian hands.\n\nI could have spent hours in this desecrated temple, pondering on the\nbrevity of life, as compared with its age. There is something pure and\ncalm in such a spot, that influences the feelings of those who pause in\nit; and by reminding them of the inevitable lot of all sublunary\nthings, renders the cares incidental to all who breathe, less acutely\nfelt for the time.\n\nIs not every ruin a history of the fate of generations, which century\nafter century has seen pass away?--generations of mortals like\nourselves, who have been moved by the same passions, and vexed by the\nsame griefs; like us, who were instinct with life and spirit, yet whose\nvery dust has disappeared. Nevertheless, we can yield to the futile\npleasures, or to the petty ills of life, as if their duration was to be\nof long extent, unmindful that ages hence, others will visit the\nobjects we now behold, and find them little changed, while we shall\nhave in our turn passed away, leaving behind no trace of our existence.\n\nI never see a beautiful landscape, a noble ruin, or a glorious fane,\nwithout wishing that I could bequeath to those who will come to visit\nthem when I shall be no more, the tender thoughts that filled my soul\nwhen contemplating them; and thus, even in death, create a sympathy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nARLES.\n\nWe stopped but a short time at Beaucaire, where we saw the largo plain\non the banks of the Rhone, on which are erected the wooden houses for\nthe annual fair which takes place in July, when the scene is said to\npresent a very striking effect.\n\nThese wooden houses are filled with articles of every description, and\nare inhabited by the venders who bring their goods to be disposed of to\nthe crowds of buyers who flock here from all parts, offering, in the\nvariety of their costumes and habits, a very animated and showy\npicture.\n\nThe public walk, which edges the grassy plain allotted to the fair, is\nbordered by large elm-trees, and the vicinity to the river insures that\nfreshness always so desirable in summer, and more especially in a\nclimate so warm as this.\n\nThe town of Beaucaire has little worthy of notice, except its\nHòtel-de-Ville and church, both of which are handsome buildings. We\ncrossed the Rhone over the bridge of boats, from which we had a good\nview, and arrived at Tarascon.\n\nThe château called the Castle of King René, but which was erected by\nLouis II, count of Provence, is an object of interest to all who love\nto ponder on the olden time, when gallant knights and lovely dames\nassembled here for those tournaments in which the good René delighted.\n\nAlas for the change! In those apartments in which the generous monarch\nloved to indulge the effusions of his gentle muse, and where fair\nladies smiled, and belted knights quaffed ruby wine to their healths,\nnow dwell reckless felons and hopeless debtors; for the château is\nconverted into a prison.\n\nIn the Church of St. Martha we saw a relic of the barbarism of the dark\nages, in the shape of a grotesque representation of a dragon, called\nthe Tarasque. This image is formed of wood, rudely painted in gandy\ncolours.\n\nTwice a-year it is borne through the streets of Tarascon, in\ncommemoration of the destruction of a fabulous monster that long\nfrequented the Rhone, and devoured many of the inhabitants of the\nsurrounding country, but was at length vanquished by St. Martha; who,\nhaving secured it round the neck by her veil, delivered it to the just\nvengeance of the Tarascons. This legend is received as truth by common\npeople, and our guide informed us that they warmly resent any _doubt_\nof its authenticity.\n\nThe monument of St. Martha is shown in the church dedicated to her, and\nher memory is held in great reverence at Tarascon.\n\nThe country between this place and Tarascon is fertile and well\ncultivated, and the cheerfulness of its aspect presents a striking\ncontrast to the silence and solitude of the town. The streets, however,\nare as clean as those of Holland, and the inhabitants are neat and tidy\nin their attire.\n\nThe houses are for the most part old and dilapidated, looking in nearly\nas ruined a condition as the fragments of antiquity which date so many\ncenturies before them. Nevertheless, some of the streets and dwellings\nseem to indicate that a spirit of improvement is abroad.\n\nOur hôtel is a large, crazy, old mansion, reminding me of some of those\nat Shrewsbury; and its furniture appears to be coeval with it, as\nnothing can be more homely or misshapen. Oak and walnut-tree chairs,\nbeds, and tables form the chief part, and these are in a very rickety\ncondition; nevertheless, an air of cleanliness and comfort pervades the\nrooms, and with the extreme rusticity of the _ameublement_, give one\nthe notion of being in some huge old farm-house.\n\nNor is the manner of the good hostess calculated to dispel this\nillusion. When our three carriages drove to her door, though prepared\nfor our arrival by the courier, she repeatedly said that her poor house\nhad no accommodation for such guests, and we had some difficulty in\npersuading her that we were easily satisfied.\n\nShe had donned her fête dress for our reception, and presented a very\npicturesque appearance, as she stood smiling and bustling about at the\ndoor. She wore a high cap reminding me of those of the women in\nNormandy: brown stays; linsey-woolsey, voluminous petticoats;\nhandkerchief and apron trimmed with rich old-fashioned lace; and long\ngold ear-rings, and chain of the same material, twisted at least ten\ntimes round her neck.\n\nShe explained to us, in a _patois_ not easily understood, that her\nhouse was only frequented by the farmers, and their wives and\ndaughters, who attended the fetes, or occasionally by a stray traveller\nwho came to explore the antiquities.\n\nBefore I had travelled much on the Continent, I confess that the\nappearance of this dwelling would have rather startled me as a _séjour_\nfor two days, but now I can relish its rusticity; for cleanliness, that\nmost indispensable of all requisites to comfort, is not wanting.\n\nThe furniture is scrubbed into brightness, the small diamond-shaped\npanes of the old-fashioned casements are clean as hands can make them;\nthe large antique fireplace is filled with fresh flowers; and the\nwalnut-tree tables are covered with white napkins.\n\nNo sooner had we performed our ablutions, and changed our travelling\ndresses for others, than our good hostess, aided by three active young\ncountry maidens, served up a plentiful dinner, consisting of an\nexcellent _pot-au-feu_, followed by fish, fowl, and flesh, sufficient\nto satisfy the hunger of at least four times the number of our party.\n\nHaving covered the table until it literally \"groaned with the weight of\nthe feast,\" she seated herself at a little distance from it, and issued\nher commands to her hand-maidens what to serve, and when to change a\nplate, what wine to offer, and which dish she most recommended, with a\ngood-humoured attention to our wants, that really anticipated them.\n\nThere was something as novel as patriarchal in her mode of doing the\nhonours, and it pleased us so much that we invited her to partake of\nour repast; but she could not be prevailed on, though she consented to\ndrink our healths in a glass of her best wine.\n\nShe repeatedly expressed her fears that our dinner was not sufficiently\n_recherché_, and hoped we would allow her to prepare a good supper.\n\nWhen we were descending the stairs, she met us with several of her\nfemale neighbours _en grande toilette_, whom she had invited to see the\nstrangers, and who gazed at us with as much surprise as if we were\nnatives of Otaheite, beheld for the first time. Cordial greetings,\nhowever, atoned for the somewhat too earnest examination to which we\nhad been subjected; and many civil speeches from our good hostess, who\nseemed not a little proud of displaying her foreign guests, rewarded\nthe patience with which we submitted to the inspection.\n\nOne old lady felt the quality of our robes, another admired our\ntrinkets, and a third was in raptures with our veils. In short, as a\nFrenchwoman would say, we had _un grand succès_; and so, our hostess\nassured us.\n\nWe went over the Amphitheatre, the dimensions of which exceed those of\nthe Amphitheatre at Nismes. Three orders of architecture are also\nintroduced in it, and it has no less than sixty arcades, with four\nlarge doors; that on the north side has a very imposing effect. The\ncorridor leading to the arena exhibits all the grandeur peculiar to the\npublic buildings of the Romans, and is well worthy of attention; but\nthe portion of the edifice that most interested me was the\nsubterranean, which a number of workmen were busily employed in\nexcavating, under the superintendence of the Prefect of Arles, a\ngentleman with whose knowledge of the antiquities of his native town,\nand urbanity towards the strangers who visit them, we have every reason\nto be satisfied.\n\nUnder his guidance, we explored a considerable extent of the recently\nexcavated subterranean, a task which requires no slight devotion to\nantiquities to induce the visitor to persevere, the inequalities of the\nground exposing one continually to the danger of a fall, or to the\nstill more perilous chance--as occurred to one of our party--of the\nhead coming in contact with the roof.\n\nWe saw also fragments of a theatre in the garden of the convent of La\nMiséricorde, consisting of two large marble columns and two arches.\n\nIn the ancient church of St. Anne, now converted into a museum, are\ncollected all the fragments of antiquity discovered at Arles, and in\nits vicinity; some of them highly interesting, and bearing evidences of\nthe former splendour of the place.\n\nAn altar dedicated to the Goddess of Good; the celebrated Mithras with\na serpent coiled round him, between the folds of which are sculptured\nthe signs of the zodiac; Medea and her children; a mile-stone, bearing\nthe names of the Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian; a basso-relievo\nof the Muses; several sarcophagi, votive altars, cornices, pillars,\nmutilated statues, and inscriptions, are here carefully preserved: but\nnothing in the collection equals the statue known by the title of the\nVenus of Arles, found here, and which is so deservedly admired at the\nLouvre.\n\nAn obelisk of granite, about sixty feet high, said to be the only\nantique one in France, stands on the place of the Hôtel-de-Ville.\nDiscovered in 1389, it was not disinterred from the earth in which it\nwas embedded until the reign of Charles IX, and was erected on its\npresent site in 1676, with a dedication to the then reigning sovereign,\nLouis XIV; A globe, ornamented with _fleurs de lis_ placed on its\npoint, deteriorates, in my opinion, from the beauty of its effect. It\nwas originally in one block, but it was broken in two by its overturn.\n\nMany houses in the streets have portions of columns, friezes, and\ncornices embedded in their walls; and one of them, occupied by a\nbarber, had a column in front, to which the insignia of his profession\nwere attached. Ruins, said to be those of the palace of Constantine,\nwere pointed out to us, as well as fragments of a forum and baths.\n\nArles is certainly one of the most interesting towns I have ever seen,\nwhether viewed as a place remarkable for the objects of antiquity it\ncontains, or for the primitive manners of its inhabitants and its\npicturesque appearance.\n\nThe quays are spacious and well built, presenting a very different\naspect to the streets; for the former are very populous, being\nfrequented by the boatmen who ply their busy commerce between Lyons and\nMarseilles--dépôts for the merchandise being erected along them, while\nthe latter are comparatively deserted.\n\nWith this facility of communication with two such flourishing towns, it\nis extraordinary that Arles should have so long retained the primitive\nsimplicity that seems to pervade it, and that a good hotel has not yet\nbeen established here.\n\nOur good hostess provided nearly as substantial a supper for us last\nnight as the early dinner served up on our arrival, and again presided\nat the repast, pressing us to eat, and recommending, with genuine\nkindness, the various specimens of dainties set before us. Our beds,\nthough homely, were clean; and I have seldom, in the most luxurious\nones, reposed equally soundly.\n\nWhen our courier asked for the bill this morning, the landlady declared\nshe \"knew not what to charge, that she never was in the habit of making\nout bills, and that we must give her what we thought right.\"\n\nThe courier urged the necessity of having a regular bill, explaining to\nher that he was obliged to file all bills, and produce them every week\nfor the arrangement of his accounts,--but in vain: she could not, she\ndeclared, make one out; and no one in her house was more expert than\nherself.\n\nShe came to us, laughing and protesting, and ended by saying, \"Pay what\nyou like; things are very cheap at Arles. You have eaten very little;\nreally, it is not worth charging for.\" But, when we persisted on having\nher at least name a sum, to our infinite surprise she asked, if a\ncouple of louis would be too much?--And this for a party of six, and\nsix servants, for two days!\n\nWe had some difficulty in inducing her to accept a suitable\nindemnification, and parted, leaving her proclaiming what she was\npleased to consider our excessive generosity, and reiterating her good\nwishes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nST.-RÉMY.\n\nThe town of St.-Rémy is delightfully situated in a hollow that\nresembles the crater of an extinct volcano, and is surrounded by\nluxuriant groves of olive. The streets, though generally narrow, are\nrendered picturesque by several old houses, the architecture of which\nis striking; and the _place_--for even St.-Rémy has its Place Publique\nand Hôtel-de-Ville--is not without pretensions to ornament. In the\ncentre of this _place_ is a pretty fountain, of a pyramidal form.\n\nThe antiquities which attracted us to St.-Rémy are at a short distance\nfrom the town, on an eminence to the south of it, and are approached by\na road worthy the objects to which it conducts. They consist of a\ntriumphal arch, and a mausoleum, about forty-five feet asunder.\n\nOf the triumphal arch, all above the archivault has disappeared,\nleaving but the portico, the proportions of which are neither lofty nor\nwide. On each side of it are two fluted columns, said to have been of\nthe Corinthian order, but without capitals, and the intercolumniations,\nin each of which are figures of male and female captives.\n\nA tree divides the male from the female; their hands are tied, and\nchained to the tree; and a graceful drapery falls from above the heads\ndown to the consoles on which the figures stand.\n\nOn the eastern side of the arch are also figures, representing two\nwomen, by the side of two men. One of the women has her hand on the arm\nof a chained warrior, and the other has at her feet military trophies;\namong which bucklers, arms, and trumpets, may be seen. The pilasters\nthat bound the intercolumniations are of the Doric order, and their\ncapitals support the arch.\n\nThe cornice and astragals form a frieze, in which military emblems and\nsymbols of sacrifice are intermingled. The archivault is ornamented on\neach side with sculptured wreaths of ivy, pine cones, branches of\ngrapes and olives, interlaced with ribands. The ceiling of the portico\nis divided into hexagons and squares, enriched by various designs in\nthe shape of eggs and roses, finely executed.\n\nThis interesting monument appears to have been ornamented with equal\ncare and richness on every side, but its decorations have not enabled\nany of the numerous antiquaries who have hitherto examined it to throw\nany light on its origin; and the destruction of its architecture must\nhave caused that of its inscription, if, indeed, it ever bore one.\n\nThe mausoleum is even more curious than the arch, as being the only\nbuilding of a similar character of architecture to be seen.\n\nPlaced on a large square pediment, approached by two steps, the edifice\nrises with unequalled lightness and beauty against the blue sky,\nforming two stages supported by columns and pilasters, united by a\nfinely sculptured frieze. The first stage retreats from the pediment;\nand the second, which is of a round form, and terminated by a\nconical-shaped top, is less in advance than the first, giving a\npyramidal effect.\n\nThe four fronts of the pediment are nearly covered by bassi-relievi,\nrepresenting battles of infantry; the figures of which are nearly as\nlarge as life, and admirably designed.\n\nOn the north front is a combat of cavalry; on the west, an engagement,\nin the midst of which the body of a man is lying on the ground, one\nparty of soldiers endeavouring to take possession of it, while another\nband of soldiers are trying to prevent them.\n\nThe basso-relievo of the south front represents a field of battle,\nstrewed with the dead and wounded, and mingled with warriors on\nhorseback and on foot. On one side is seen a wild boar between the legs\nof the soldiers; and on the other, a female figure, quite nude,\nprostrate on the earth before a rearing horse, which some soldiers are\nendeavouring to restrain.\n\nIn the centre of the basso-relievo is an old man expiring, surrounded\nby several persons; and at one end a soldier, bearing arms on his\nshoulder, has been left unfinished by the sculptor; there not being\nsufficient space for the figure, which is partly designed on the\nadjoining pilaster.\n\nOn the east front is a winged female bearing the attributes of Victory,\nwith several women and warriors, and an allegorical personage said to\nrepresent a river, because it holds in one hand a symbol of water. This\nlast figure, also, is partly sculptured on the contiguous pilaster, as\nis the one previously noted, which proves that these ornaments were not\nexecuted at the time of the erection of the edifice.\n\nThe pediment has a simple cornice around it, and the angles are\nfinished by voluted pilasters without a base, but with Ionic capitals,\nwhich have an extraordinary effect. Above the basso-relievo is a\nmassive garland, supported by three boys, at equal distances; and\nbetween them are four heads of old men, as hideously grotesque as the\nimaginations of the sculptors could render them.\n\nThe first stage of the mausoleum which rises from this pedestal is\npierced by an arch on each side, in the form of a portico, and their\narchivaults are ornamented by foliage and scrolls.\n\nThe arches rest on plain pilasters, with capitals more resembling the\nDoric than any other order of architecture. On the keystone of each\narch is the mark of a youthful male head, surmounted by two wings. The\nfour angles of the first stage are finished by a fluted column, with a\ncapital charmingly executed, like, but not quite, the Corinthian. These\ncolumns sustain an entablature or two, which terminate this stage, and\nits frieze is enriched with sculpture representing winged sea-monsters\nand sirens with sacrificial instruments.\n\nAbove the first stage rises the second, which is of a round form, with\nten fluted columns, which support its circular entablature; the\ncapitals of these columns are similar to those of the first stage, and\nthe frieze is ornamented with foliage delicately sculptured.\n\nA round cupola terminates this building, through which the light shines\nin on every side, although two male statues in togas occupy the centre\nof it.\n\nTo view the height at which these figures are placed, one would suppose\nthey were safe from the attacks of the mischievous or the curious;\nnevertheless, they did not escape, for, many years ago, during the\nnight, their heads were taken off, and those that replaced them reflect\nlittle credit on the taste or skill of the modern sculptor who executed\nthe task.\n\nOn the architrave of the entablature of the first stage, and on the\nnorth front, is the following inscription:--\n\n     SEX. L. M. JVLIEI. C.F. PARENTIBUS. SVEIS.\n\nVarious are the opinions given by the writers who have noticed this\nmonument as to the cause for which, and person, or persons for whom, it\nwas erected. Some maintain that the triumphal arch from its vicinity\nhas a relation to the mausoleum, while others assert them to have been\nbuilt at different epochs.\n\nThe inscription has only served to base the different hypotheses of\nantiquaries, among which that of the Abbé Barthélemy is considered the\nmost probable; namely, that in the three first words are found two\ninitials, which he considers may be rendered as follows:--\n\n     SEXTUS · LUCIVS · MARCVS;\n\nand the two other initials, C.F., which follow the word JVLIEI, may be\nexplained in the same manner to signify Caii Filii, and, being joined\nto Juliei, which precedes, may be received to mean Julii Caii Filii.\n\nMantour's reading of the inscription is, Caius Sextius Lucius, Maritus\nJULIÆ Incomparabilis, Curavit Fieri PARENTIBUS SUIS; which he\ntranslates into Caius Sextius Lucius, Husband of Julia, caused this\nMonument to be erected to the Memory of his Ancestors, and the\nvictories achieved by them in Provence, which on different occasions\nhad been the theatre of war of the Romans.\n\nBouche's version of it is,--\n\n\n             {Lucius,  }\n     Sextus  {Lælius,  }  Maritus Juliæ.\n             {Liberius,}\n\n     Istud Cenotaphium,}\n          or,          }  Fecit Parentibus Suis;\n     Intra Circulum,   }\n\nwhich he asserts to mean,--Sextus, in honour of his Father and Mother,\nburied in this place, and represented by the two statues surrounded by\ncolumns in the upper part of the mausoleum.\n\nMonsieur P. Malosse, to whose work on the antiquities of St.-Rémy I am\nindebted for the superficial knowledge I have attained of these\ninteresting objects, explains the inscription to mean,--\n\n\n     SEXTVS · LVCIVS · MARCVS · JVLIEI · CVRAV ·\n     ERUNT · FIERE · SUEIS;\n\nwhich he translates into Sextus, Lucius, Marcus (all three), of the\nrace of Julius, elevated this monument to the glory of their relations.\n\nM. Malosse believes that the mausoleum was erected to Julius, and the\narch to Augustus Cæsar--the first being dead, and the second then\nliving; and that the statues in the former, in the Roman togas, were\nintended to represent the two.\n\nHe imagines that the subjects of the bassi-relievi on the four fronts\nof the mausoleum bear out this hypothesis. That of the east, he says,\nrepresents the combat of the Romans with the Germans on the bank of the\nRhine (of which river the one on the basso-relievo is the emblem), and\nthe triumph of Cæsar over Ariovistus, whoso women were taken prisoners.\n\nThe basso-relievo on the south front represents Cæsar's conquest of the\nAllobroges, and the capture of the daughter of Orgetorix, one of the\nmost powerful men of the country, and instigator of the war. The\nbasso-relievo on the north front, representing a combat of cavalry,\nrefers to the victory over the Britons; and that of the west front, to\nthe battle gained by the Romans over the Gauls, in which the general of\nthe latter was killed in the midst of his soldiers, who endeavoured to\nprevent his being seized by the enemy.\n\nPassages from the _Commentaries of Cæsar_, favour this ingenious\ninterpretation of M.P. Malosse; but the abbreviations adopted in the\ninscription, while well calculated to give rise to innumerable\nhypotheses, will for ever leave in doubt, by whom, and in honour of\nwhom, these edifices were erected, as well as the epoch at which they\nwere built.\n\nWho could look on these monuments without reflecting on the vanity of\nmortals in thus offering up testimonials of their respect for persons\nof whose very names posterity is ignorant? For the identity of those in\nwhose honour the Arch of Triumph and Mausoleum of St.-Rémy were raised\npuzzles antiquaries as much as does that of the individual for whom the\npyramid of Egypt was built. Vain effort, originating in the weakness of\nour nature, to preserve the memory of that which was dear to us, and\nwhich we would fain believe will insure the reverence of ages unborn\nfor that which we venerated!\n\n     ON THE TRIUMPHAL ARCH AND MAUSOLEUM AT ST.-RÉMY.\n\n1.\n\nYon stately tomb that seeks the sky,\n  Erected to the glorious dead,\nThrough whose high arches sweeps, the sigh\n  The night winds heave when day has fled;\n\n2.\n\nHow fair its pillared stories rise\n  'Gainst yon blue firmament so pure;\nFair as they met admiring eyes,\n  Long ages past, they still endure.\n\n3.\n\nYes, many a race hath left the earth\n  Since first this Mausoleum rose;\nSo many, that the name, or birth,\n  Of dead, or founder, no one knows.\n\n4.\n\nThe sculptured pictures, all may see,\n  Were by a skilful artist wrought;\nBut, Time! the secret rests with thee,\n  Which to unravel men have sought.\n\n5.\n\nOf whom were they, the honoured dead,\n  Whose mem'ry Love would here record?\nLift up the veil, so long o'erspread,\n  And tell whose dust yon fane doth guard.\n\n6.\n\nName those whose love outlived the grave\n  And sought to give for aye to fame\nMementos of the good and brave,\n  Of whom thou hast effaced the name.\n\n7.\n\nWe know but that they lived and died,--\n  No more this stately tomb can tell:\nHere come and read a lesson, Pride,\n  This monument can give so well.\n\n8.\n\nThey lived--they hoped--they suffered--loved--\n  As all of Earth have ever done;\nWere oft by wild Ambition moved,\n  And basked, perchance, 'neath glory's Sun.\n\n9.\n\nThey deemed that they should leave behind\n  Undying names. Yet, mark this fane,\nFor whom it rose, by whom designed,\n  Learned antiquaries search in vain.\n\n10.\n\nStill doth it wear the form it wore,\n  Through the dim lapse of by-gone age;\nTriumph of Art in days of yore,\n  Whose Hist'ry fills the classic page.\n\n11.\n\nTo honour Victors it is said\n  'Twas raised, though none their names can trace;\nIt stands as monument instead,\n  Unto each long-forgotten race,\n\n12.\n\nWho came, like me, to gaze and brood\n  Upon it in this lonely spot--\nTheir minds with pensive thoughts imbued,\n  That Heroes could be thus forgot.\n\n13.\n\nYet still the wind a requiem sighs,\n  And the blue sky above it weeps;\nThu Sun pours down its radiant dyes,\n  Though none can tell who 'neath it sleeps.\n\n14.\n\nAnd seasons roll, and centuries pass,\n  And still unchanged thou keep'st thy place;\nWhile we, like shadows in a glass,\n  Soon glide away, and leave no trace.\n\n15.\n\nAnd yon proud Arch, the Victor's meed,\n  Is nameless as the neighbouring Tomb:\nVictor, and Dead, the Fates decreed\n  Your memory to oblivion's gloom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nLYONS.\n\nI see little alteration at Lyons since I formerly passed through it.\nIts manufactories are, nevertheless, flourishing, though less\nimprovement than could be expected is visible in the external aspect of\nthe place.\n\nThis being Sunday, and the _Féte-Dieu_, the garrison, with flags\nflying, drums beating, trumpets sounding, and all in gala dress,\nmarched through the streets to attend Divine worship. The train was\nheaded by our old acquaintance General Le Paultre de la Motte, (whom we\nleft at Lyons on our route to Italy), and his staff; wearing all their\nmilitary decorations, attended by a vast procession, including the\nwhole of the clergy in their rich attires and all the different\nreligious communities in the town.\n\nThe officers were bare-headed--their spurred heels and warlike\ndemeanour rendering this homage to a sacred ceremony more picturesque.\nThe gold and silver brocaded vestments and snowy robes of the priests\nglittering in the sun, as they marched along to the sound of martial\nmusic, looked very gorgeous; and this mixture of ecclesiastical and\nmilitary pomp had an imposing effect.\n\nThe streets through which the procession passed were ornamented with\nrich draperies and flowers, reminding me of Italy on similar occasions;\nand the intense heat of a sun glowing like a fiery furnace, aided the\nrecollection.\n\nSince I have been on the continent, it has often struck me with\nsurprise, that on solemn occasions like the present, sacred music has\nnot been performed instead of military. Nay, I have heard quadrilles\nand waltzes played, fruitful in festive associations little suited to\nthe feelings which ought to have been excited by solemn ceremonials.\n\nKnowing, by experience, the effect produced on the mind by sacred\nmusic, it is much to be wished that so potent an aid to devotional\nsentiment should not be omitted, _malgré_ whatever may be said against\nany extraneous assistance in offering up those devotions which the\nheart should be ever prompt to fulfil without them.\n\nI leave to casuists to argue whether, or how far, music, sculpture, or\npainting, may be employed as excitements to religious fervour: but I\nconfess, although the acknowledgment may expose me to the censure of\nthose who differ with me in opinion, that I consider them powerful\nadjuncts, and, consequently, not to be resigned because _some_--and\nhappy, indeed, may they be deemed--stand in no need of such incitements\nto devotion.\n\nWho that has heard the \"_Miserere_\" in the Sistine chapel at Rome, and\nseen, while listening to it, \"The Last Judgment,\" by Michael Angelo, on\nits walls, without feeling the powerful influence they exercised on the\nfeelings?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nPARIS.\n\n_June_, 1828.--A fatiguing journey, over dusty roads, and in intensely\nhot weather, has brought us to Paris, with no accident save the failure\nof one of the wheels of our large landau--a circumstance that caused\nthe last day's travelling to be any thing but agreeable; for though our\ncourier declared the temporary repair it received rendered it perfectly\nsafe, I was by no means satisfied on the point.\n\nWe have taken up our abode in the Hôtel de la Terrasse, Rue de Rivoli,\nare well-lodged, but somewhat incommoded by the loud reverberation of\nthe pavement, as the various vehicles roll rapidly over it. We were\ntold that \"it would be nothing when we got used to it\"--an assertion,\nthe truth of which, I trust, we shall not remain sufficiently long to\ntest; for I have a peculiar objection to noise of every kind, and a\nlong residence in Italy has not conquered it.\n\nSo here we are, once more, at Paris, after six years' absence from it;\nand I find all that has hitherto met my eyes in it _in statu quo_. How\nmany places have I seen during that period; how many associations\nformed; how many and what various impressions received; and here is\nevery thing around looking so precisely as I left them, that I can\nhardly bring myself to believe that I have indeed been so many years\nabsent!\n\nWhen we bring back with us the objects most dear, and find those we\nleft unchanged, we are tempted to doubt the lapse of time; but one link\nin the chain of affection broken, and every thing seems altered.\n\nOn entering Paris, I felt my impatience to see our dear friends there\nredouble; and, before we had despatched the dinner awaiting our\narrival, the Duc and Duchesse de Guiche, came to us. How warm was our\ngreeting; how many questions to be asked and answered; how many\ncongratulations and pleasant plans for the future to be formed; how\nmany reminiscences of our mutual _séjour_ in dear Italy to be talked\nover!\n\nThe Duchesse was radiant in health and beauty, and the Duc looking, as\nhe always does, more _distingué_, than any one else--the perfect _beau\nidéal_ of a nobleman.\n\nWe soon quitted the _salle à manger_; for who could eat during the joy\nof a first meeting with those so valued?--Not I, certainly; and all the\nrest of our party were as little disposed to do honour to the repast\ncommanded for us.\n\nIt was a happy evening. Seated in the _salon_, and looking out on the\npleasant gardens of the Tuileries, the perfume of whose orange-trees\nwas wafted to us by the air as we talked over old times, and indulged\nin cheerful anticipations of new ones, and the tones of voices familiar\nto the ears thus again restored, were heard with emotion.\n\nYes, the meeting of dear friends atones for the regret of separation;\nand like it so much enhances affection, that after absence one wonders\nhow one has been able to stay away from them so long.\n\nToo excited to sleep, although fatigued, I am writing down my\nimpressions; yet how tame and colourless they seem on paper when\ncompared with the emotions that dictate them! How often have I\nexperienced the impossibility of painting strong feelings during their\nreign!\n\n[_Mem_.--We should be cautious in giving implicit credit to\ndescriptions written with great power, as I am persuaded they indicate\na too perfect command of the faculties of the head to admit the\npossibility of those of the heart having been much excited when they\nwere written.\n\nThis belief of mine controverts the assertion of the poet--\n\n     \"He best can paint them who has felt them most.\"\n\nExcept that the poet says who _has_ felt; yes, it is after, and not\nwhen most felt that sentiments can be most powerfully expressed. But to\nbed! to bed!]\n\nI have had a busy day; engaged during the greater portion of it in the\nmomentous occupation of shopping. Every thing belonging to my toilette\nis to be changed, for I have discovered--\"tell it not in Gath\"--that my\nhats, bonnets, robes, mantles, and pelisses, are totally _passée de\nmode_, and what the _modistes_ of Italy declared to be _la dernière\nmode de Paris_ is so old as to be forgotten here.\n\nThe woman who wishes to be a philosopher must avoid Paris! Yesterday I\nentered it, caring or thinking as little of _la mode_ as if there were\nno such tyrant; and lo! to-day, I found myself ashamed, as I looked\nfrom the Duchess de Guiche, attired in her becoming and pretty\n_peignoir à la neige_ and _chapeau du dernier goût_, to my own dress\nand bonnet, which previously I had considered very wearable, if not\nvery tasteful.\n\nOur first visit was to Herbault's, the high-priest of the Temple of\nFashion at Paris; and I confess, the look of astonishment which he\nbestowed on my bonnet did not help to reassure my confidence as to my\nappearance.\n\nThe Duchesse, too quick-sighted not to observe his surprise, explained\nthat I had been six years absent from Paris, and only arrived the night\nbefore from Italy. I saw the words _à la bonne heure_ hovering on the\nlips of Herbault, he was too well-bred to give utterance to them, and\nimmediately ordered to be brought forth the choicest of his hats, caps,\nand turbans.\n\nOh, the misery of trying on a new _mode_ for the first time, and before\na stranger! The eye accustomed to see the face to which it appertains\nenveloped in a _chapeau_ more or less large or small, is shocked at the\nfirst attempt to wear one of a different size; and turns from the\ncontemplation of the image presented in the glass with any thing but\nself-complacency, listening incredulously to the flattering encomiums\nof the not disinterested _marchand de modes_, who avers that \"_Ce\nchapeau sied parfaitement à Madame la Comtesse, et ce bonnet lui va à\nravir_.\"\n\nI must, however, render M. Herbault the justice to say, that he evinced\nno ordinary tact in suggesting certain alterations in his _chapeaux_\nand caps, in order to suit my face; and, aided by the inimitable good\ntaste of the Duchesse, who passes for an oracle in _affaires de modes à\nParis_, a selection was made that enabled me to leave M. Herbault's,\nlooking a little more like other people.\n\nFrom his Temple of Fashion we proceeded to the _lingère à la mode_,\nMdlle. La Touche, where _canezous_ and _robes de matin_ were to be\nchosen and ordered; and we returned to the Hôtel de la Terrasse, my\nhead filled with notions of the importance of dressing _à la mode_, to\nwhich yesterday it was a stranger, and my purse considerably lightened\nby the two visits I had paid.\n\nEnglishwomen who have not made their purchases at the houses of the\n_marchandes de modes_ considered the most _recherché_ at Paris, have no\nidea of the extravagance of the charges. Prices are demanded that\nreally make a prudent person start; nevertheless, she who wishes to\nattain the distinction so generally sought, of being perfectly well\ndressed, which means being in the newest fashion, must submit to pay\nlargely for it.\n\nThree hundred and twenty francs for a crape hat and feathers, two\nhundred for a _chapeau à fleurs_, one hundred for a _chapeau négligé de\nmatin_, and eighty-five francs for an evening-cap composed of tulle\ntrimmed with blonde and flowers, are among the prices asked, and, to my\nshame be it said, given.\n\nIt is true, hats, caps, and bonnets may be had for very reasonable\nprices in the shops in the Rue Vivienne and elsewhere at Paris, as I\nand many of my female compatriots found out when I was formerly in this\ngay capital; but the bare notion of wearing such would positively shock\na lady of fashion at Paris, as much as it would an English one, to\nappear in a hat manufactured in Cranbourn Alley.\n\nHere Fashion is a despot, and no one dreams of evading its dictates.\n\nHaving noticed the extravagance of the prices, it is but fair to remark\nthe elegance and good taste of the millinery to be found at Monsieur\nHerbault's. His _chapeaux_ look as if made by fairy fingers, so fresh,\nso light, do they appear; and his caps seem as if the gentlest sigh of\na summer's zephyr would bear them from sight, so aerial is their\ntexture, and so delicate are the flowers that adorn them, fresh from\nthe _ateliers_ of Natier, or Baton.\n\nBeware, O ye uxorious husbands! how ye bring your youthful brides to\nthe dangerous atmosphere of Paris, while yet in that paradise of fools\nycleped the honey-moon, ere you have learned to curve your brows into a\nfrown, or to lengthen your visages at the sight of a long bill.\n\nIn that joyful season, when having pleased your eyes and secured your\nhearts, your fair brides, with that amiability which is one of the\npeculiar characteristics of their sex, are anxious to please all the\nworld, and from no other motive than that _your_ choice should be\nadmired, beware of entering Paris, except _en passant_. Wait until you\nhave recovered that firmness of character which generally comes back to\na Benedict after the first year of his nuptials, before you let your\nwives wander through the tempting mazes of the _magasins de modes_ of\nthis intoxicating city.\n\nAnd you, fair dames, \"with stinted sums assigned,\" in the shape of\npin-money, beware how you indulge that taste for pretty bonnets, hats,\ncaps, and turbans, with which all bountiful Nature has so liberally\ngifted you; for, alas! \"beneath the roses fierce Repentance rears her\nsnaky crest\" in form of a bill, the payment of which will \"leave you\npoor indeed\" for many a long day after, unless your liege lord, melted\nby the long-drawn sighs heaved when you remark on the wonderfully high\nprices of things at Paris, opens his purse-strings, and, with something\nbetween a pshaw and a grunt, makes you an advance of your next\nquarter's pin-money; or, better still, a present of one of the hundred\npounds with which he had intended to try his good luck at the club.\n\nWent yesterday to the Rue d'Anjou, to visit Madame Craufurd. Her hôtel\nis a charming one, _entre cour et jardin_; and she is the most\nextraordinary person of her age I have ever seen. In her eightieth\nyear, she does not look to be more than fifty-five; and possesses all\nthe vivacity and good humour peculiar only to youth.\n\nScrupulously exact in her person, and dressed with the utmost care, as\nwell as good taste, she gives me a notion of the appearance which the\ncelebrated Ninon de l'Enclos must have presented at the same age, and\nhas much of the charm of manner said to have belonged to that\nremarkable woman.\n\nIt was an interesting sight to see her surrounded by her grand-children\nand great-grand-children, all remarkable for their good looks, and\naffectionately attached to her, while she appears not a little proud of\nthem. The children of the Duc de Guiche have lost nothing of their\nbeauty since their _séjour_ at Pisa, and are as ingenuous and amusing\nas formerly.\n\nI never saw such handsome children before, nor so well brought up. No\ntrouble or expense is spared in their education; and the Duc and\nDuchesse devote a great portion of their time to them.\n\nAll our friends are occupied in looking out for a house for us; and I\nhave this day been over, at least, ten--only one of which seems likely\nto suit.\n\nI highly approve the mode at Paris of letting unfurnished houses, or\napartments, with mirrors and decorations, as well as all fixtures (with\nus, in England, always charged separately) free of any extra expense.\nThe good taste evinced in the ornaments is in general remarkable, and\nfar superior to what is to be met with in England; where, if one\nengages a new house lately papered or painted, one is compelled to\nrecolour the rooms before they can be occupied, owing to the gaudy and\nill-assorted patterns originally selected.\n\nThe house of the Maréchal Lobau, forming the corner of the Rue de\nBourbon, is the one I prefer of all those I have yet seen, although it\nhas many _désagrémens_ for so large an establishment as ours. But I am\ncalled to go to the review in the Champ-de-Mars, so _allons_ for a\n_spectacle militaire_, which, I am told, is to be very fine.\n\nThe review was well worth seeing; and the troops performed their\nevolutions with great precision. The crowd of spectators was immense;\nso much so, that those only who formed part of the royal _cortège_\ncould reach the Champ-de-Mars in time to see its commencement. No\ncarriages, save those of the court, were allowed to enter the file.\n\nThe dust was insupportable; and the pretty dresses of the ladies\nsuffered from it nearly as much as did the smart uniforms of the\nofficers.\n\nThe _coup d'oeil_ from the pavilion (where we had, thanks to our\n_chaperon_, the Duchesse de Guiche, front seats) was very fine. The\nvarious and splendid uniforms, floating standards, waving plumes,\nglittering arms, and prancing steeds, gave to the vast plain over which\nthe troops were moving a most animated aspect, while the sounds of\nmartial music exhilarated the spirits.\n\nNor was the view presented by the interior of the pavilion without its\ncharms. A number of ladies, some of them young and handsome, and all\nremarkably well-dressed, gave to the benches ranged along it the\nappearance of a rich _parterre_, among the flowers of which the\nbeautiful Duchesse de Guiche shone pre-eminent.\n\nI was seated next to a lady, with large lustrous eyes and a pale olive\ncomplexion, whose countenance, from its extreme mobility, attracted my\nattention; at one moment, lighting up with intelligence, and the next,\nsoftening into pensiveness.\n\nA remarkably handsome young man stood behind her, holding her shawl,\nand lavishing on her those attentions peculiar to young Benedicts. The\nlady proved to be the Marchioness de Loulé, sister to the King of\nPortugal; and the gentleman turned out to be her husband, for whose\n_beaux yeux_ she contracted what is considered a _mésalliance_.\n\nThe simplicity of her dress, and unaffectedness of her manner, invested\nher with new attractions in my eyes; which increased when I reflected\non the elevated position she had resigned, to follow the more humble\nfortunes of her handsome husband.\n\nHow strange, yet how agreeable too, must the change be, from the most\nformal court, over which Etiquette holds a despotic sway, to the\nfreedom from such disagreeable constraint permitted to those in private\nlife, and now enjoyed by this Spanish princess!\n\nShe appears to enjoy this newly acquired liberty with a zest in\nproportion to her past enthralment, and has proved that the daughter of\na King of Portugal has a heart, though the queens of its neighbour,\nSpain, were in former days not supposed to have legs.\n\nDuring the evolutions, a general officer was thrown from his horse; and\na universal agitation among a group of ladies evinced that they were in\na panic. Soon the name of the general, Count de Bourmont, was heard\npronounced; and a faint shriek, followed by a half swoon from one of\nthe fair dames, announced her deep interest in the accident.\n\nFlacons and vinaigrettes were presented to her on every side, all the\nladies present seeming to have come prepared for some similar\ncatastrophe; but in a few minutes a messenger, despatched by the\ngeneral, assured Madame la Comtesse of his perfect safety; and tears of\njoy testified her satisfaction at the news.\n\nThis little episode in the review shewed me the French ladies in a very\namiable point of view. Their sensibility and agitation during the\nuncertainty as to the person thrown, vouched for the liveliness of\ntheir conjugal affection; and their sympathy for Madame la Comtesse de\nBourmont when it was ascertained that her husband was the sufferer,\nbore evidence to the kindness of their hearts, as well as to their\nfacility in performing the little services so acceptable in moments\nlike those I had just witnessed.\n\nCharles X, the Dauphin and Dauphine, and the Duchesse de Berri, were\npresent--the two latter in landaus, attended by their ladies. The king\nlooked well, his grey hair and tall thin figure giving him a very\nvenerable aspect.\n\nThe Dauphine is much changed since I last saw her, and the care and\nsorrow of her childhood have left their traces on her countenance. I\nnever saw so melancholy a face, and the strength of intellect which\ncharacterises it renders it still more so, by indicating that the marks\nof sorrow so visible were not indented on that brow without many an\neffort from the strong mind to resist the attacks of grief.\n\nI remember reading years ago of the melancholy physiognomy of King\nCharles I, which when seen in his portrait by a Florentine sculptor, to\nwhom it was sent in order that a bust should be made from it, drew\nforth the observation that the countenance indicated that its owner\nwould come to a violent death.\n\nI was reminded of this anecdote by the face of the Duchesse\nd'Angoulême; for though I do not pretend to a prescience as to her\nfuture fate, I cannot help arguing from it that, even should a peaceful\nreign await her, the fearful trials of her youth have destroyed in her\nthe power of enjoyment; and that on a throne she can never forget the\nfather and mother she saw hurried from it, to meet every insult that\nmalice could invent, or cruelty could devise, before a violent death\nfreed them from their sufferings.\n\nWho can look on this heroic woman without astonishment at the power of\nendurance that has enabled her to live on under such trials? Martyr is\nwritten in legible characters on that brow, and on those lips; and her\nattempt to smile made me more sad than the tears of a mourner would\nhave done, because it revealed \"a grief too deep for tears.\"\n\nMust she not tremble for the future, if not for the present, among a\npeople so versatile as those among whom she is now thrown? And can she\nlook from the windows of the palace she has been recalled to inhabit,\nwithout seeing the spot where the fearful guillotine was reared that\nmade her an orphan?\n\nThe very plaudits that now rend the skies for her uncle must remind her\nof the shouts that followed her father to the scaffold: no wonder,\nthen, that she grows pale as she hears them; and that the memory of the\nterrible past, written in characters of blood, gives a sombre hue to\nthe present and to the future.\n\nThe sight of her, too, must awaken disagreeable recollections in those\nover whom her husband may be soon called to reign, for the history of\nthe crimes of the Revolution is stamped on her face, whose pallid lint\nand rigid muscles tell of the horror and affliction imprinted on her\nyouth; the reminiscence of which cannot be pleasant to them.\n\nThe French not only love their country passionately, but are\ninordinately proud of it; hence, aught that reminds them of its\nsins--and cruelty is one of a deep dye--must be humiliating to them; so\nthat the presence of the Duchesse d'Angoulême cannot be flattering to\ntheir _amor patriæ_ or _amour propre_. I thought of all this to-day, as\nI looked on the face of Madame la Dauphine; and breathed a hope that\nthe peace of her life's evening may console her for the misfortunes of\nits morning and its noon.\n\nThe Duchesse de Berri has an animated and peculiarly good-natured\nexpression of countenance. Her restored gaiety makes the French forget\nwhy it was long and cruelly overclouded, and aids the many good\nqualities which she possesses, in securing the popularity she has so\ngenerally acquired in the country of her adoption.\n\nHouse-hunting again, and still unsuited. Dined yesterday at the\nDuchesse de Guiche's; a very pleasant party, increased by some\nagreeable people in the evening. Our old acquaintance, William Lock,\nwas among the guests at dinner, and is as good-looking and\nlight-hearted as ever.\n\nThe Marquis l'Espérance de l'Aigle was also present, and is a perfect\nspecimen of the fine gentleman of _la Vieille Cour_--a race now nearly\nextinct. Possessing all the gaiety and vivacity of youth, with that\nattention to the feelings of others peculiar only to maturity and\nhigh-breeding, the Count l'Espérance de l'Aigle is universally beloved.\n\nHe can talk over old times with the grand-mother with all the wit that\nwe read of, oftener than we meet with; give his opinion of _la dernière\nmode_ to the youthful mother, with rare tact and good taste; dance with\nthe young daughter as actively and gracefully as any _garçon de\ndix-huit ans_ in Paris; and gallop through the Bois de Boulogne with\nthe young men who pride themselves on their riding, without being ever\nleft behind. I had frequently heard his praises from the Duchesse de\nGuiche, and found that her description of him was very accurate.\n\nThe house of the Duc de Guiche is a picture of English comfort and\nFrench elegance united; and that portion of it appropriated to its fair\nmistress is fitted up with exquisite taste. Her _salons_ and _boudoir_\nare objects of _vertù, bijouterie_, and vases of old Sèvre, enough to\nexcite envy in those who can duly appreciate such treasures, and tempt\nto the violation of the tenth commandment. Order reigns in the whole\narrangement of the establishment, which, possessing all the luxurious\nappliances of a _maison montée_, has all the scrupulous cleanliness of\nthat of a Quaker.\n\nWent to the Opera last night, where I saw the _début_ of the new\n_danseuse_ Taglioni. Hers is a totally new style of dancing; graceful\nbeyond all comparison, wonderful lightness, an absence of all violent\neffort, or at least of the appearance of it, and a modesty as new as it\nis delightful to witness in her art. She seems to float and bound like\na sylph across the stage, never executing those _tours de force_ that\nwe know to be difficult and wish were impossible, being always\nperformed at the expense of decorum and grace, and requiring only\nactivity for their achievement.\n\nShe excited the most rapturous applause, and received it with a \"decent\ndignity,\" very unlike the leering smiles with which, in general, a\n_danseuse_ thinks it necessary to advance to the front of the\nproscenium, shewing all her teeth, as she lowly courtesies to the\naudience.\n\nThere is a sentiment in the dancing of this charming votary of\nTerpsichore that elevates it far beyond the licentious style generally\nadopted by the ladies of her profession, and which bids fair to\naccomplish a reformation in it.\n\nThe Duc de Cazes, who came in to the Duchesse de Guiche's box, was\nenthusiastic in his praises of Mademoiselle Taglioni, and said hers was\nthe most poetical style of dancing he had ever seen. Another observed,\nthat it was indeed the poetry of motion. I would describe it as being\nthe epic of dancing.\n\nThe Duc de Cazes is a very distinguished looking man, with a fine and\nintelligent countenance, and very agreeable manners.\n\n_À propos_ of manners, I am struck with the great difference between\nthose of Frenchmen and Englishmen, of the same station in life. The\nlatter treat women with a politeness that seems the result of habitual\namenity; the former with a homage that appears to be inspired by the\npeculiar claims of the sex, particularised in the individual woman, and\nis consequently more flattering.\n\nAn Englishman seldom lays himself out to act the agreeable to women; a\nFrenchman never omits an opportunity of so doing: hence, the attentions\nof the latter are less gratifying than those of the former, because a\nwoman, however free from vanity, may suppose that when an Englishman\ntakes the trouble--and it is evidently a trouble, more or less, to all\nour islanders to enact the agreeable--she had really inspired him with\nthe desire to please.\n\nIn France, a woman may forget that she is neither young nor handsome;\nfor the absence of these claims to attention does not expose her to be\nneglected by the male sex. In England, the elderly and the ugly \"could\na tale unfold\" of the _naïveté_ with which men evince their sense of\nthe importance of youth and beauty, and their oblivion of the presence\nof those who have neither.\n\nFrance is the paradise for old women, particularly if they are\n_spirituelle_; but England is the purgatory.\n\nThe Comtesses de Bellegarde called on me to-day, and two more\nwarm-hearted or enthusiastic persons I never saw. Though no longer\nyoung, they possess all the gaiety of youth, without any of its\nthoughtlessness, and have an earnestness in their kindness that is very\npleasant.\n\nDined yesterday at Madame Craufurd's--a very pleasant party. Met there\nthe Duc de Gramont, Duc and Duchesse de Guiche, Colonel and lady\nBarbara Craufurd, and Count Valeski.\n\nThe Duc de Gramont is a fine old man who has seen much of the world,\nwithout having been soured by its trials. Faithful to his sovereign\nduring adversity, he is affectionately cherished by the whole of the\npresent royal family, who respect and love him; and his old age is\ncheered by the unceasing devotion of his children, the Duc and Duchesse\nde Guiche, who are fondly attached to him.\n\nHe gives up much of his time to the culture of flowers, and is more\ninterested in the success of his dahlias than in those scenes of\ncourtly circles in which he is called to fill so distinguished a part.\nIt pleased me to hear him telling his beautiful daughter-in-law of the\nperfection of a flower she had procured him with some trouble; and then\nadding: \"_À propos_ of flowers, how is our sweet Ida, to-day? There is\nno flower in my garden like her!--Ay, she will soon be two years old.\"\n\nThere is something soothing to the mind in the contemplation of a man\nin the evening of life, whose youth was spent in all the splendour of a\ncourt, and whose manhood has been tried by adversity, turning to Nature\nfor her innocent pleasures, when the discovery of the futility of all\nothers has been made. This choice vouches for the purity of heart and\ngoodness of him who has adopted it, and disposes me to give ample\ncredit to all the commendation the Duchesse de Guiche used to utter of\nhim in Italy.\n\nLady Barbara Craufurd is an excellent specimen of an English woman.\nPretty, without vanity or affectation; gentle, without insipidity; and\nsimple, yet highly polished, in mariners. She has, too, a low, \"sweet\nvoice, an excellent thing in woman,\" and, to me, whose ears offer even\na more direct road to the heart than do the eyes, is a peculiar\nattraction.\n\nColonel Craufurd seems to be the quintessence of good nature and of\ngood sense. Count Valeski is an intelligent young man, greatly _à la\nmode_ at Paris, and wholly unspoilt by this distinction. Handsome,\nwell-bred, and agreeable, he is very popular, not only among the fine\nladies but fine gentlemen here, and appears worthy of the favour he\nenjoys.\n\nSeveral people of both sexes came in the evening to Madame Craufurd's,\nand we had some excellent music. Madame C. does the honours of her\n_salon_ with peculiar grace. She has a bright smile and a kind word for\nevery guest, without the slightest appearance of effort.\n\nStill house-hunting; continually tempted by elegantly decorated\n_salons_, and as continually checked by the want of room and comfort of\nthe rest of the apartments.\n\nWe have been compelled to abandon the project of taking the Maréchal\nLobau's house, or at least that portion of it which he wishes to\ndispose of, for we found it impossible to lodge so large an\nestablishment as ours in it; and, though we communicated this fact with\nall possible courtesy to the Maréchal, we have received a note in\nanswer, written in a different style, as he is pleased to think that,\nhaving twice inspected his apartments, we ought to have taken them.\n\nIn England, a person of the Maréchal's rank who had a house to let\nwould not show it _in propriâ personâ_, but would delegate that task,\nas also the terms and negotiations, to some agent; thus avoiding all\npersonal interference, and, consequently, any chance of offence: but if\npeople _will_ feel angry without any just cause, it cannot be helped;\nand so Monsieur le Maréchal must recover his serenity and acquire a\ntemper more in analogy with his name; for, though a brave and\ndistinguished officer, as well as a good man, which he is said to be,\nhe certainly is _not Bon comme un mouton_, which is his cognomen.\n\nParis is now before us,--where to choose is the difficulty. We saw\nto-day a house in the Rue St.-Honoré, _entre cour et jardin_, a few\ndoors from the English embassy. The said garden is the most tempting\npart of the affair; for, though the _salons_ and sleeping-rooms are\ngood, the only entrance, except by a _passage dérobé_ for servants, is\nthrough the _salle à manger_, which is a great objection.\n\nMany of the houses I have seen here have this defect, which the\nParisians do not seem to consider one, although the odour of dinner\nmust enter the _salons_, and that in the evening visitors must find\nservants occupied in removing the dinner apparatus, should they, as\ngenerally happens, come for the _prima sera_.\n\nFrench people, however, remain so short a time at table, and dine so\nmuch earlier than the English people do, that the employment of their\n_salle à manger_ as a passage does not annoy them.\n\nWent to the opera last night, and saw the _Muette de Portici_. It is\nadmirably got up, and the costumes and scenery, as well as the\n_tarantulas_, transported me back to Naples--dear, joyous\nNaples--again. Nourrit enacted \"Massaniello,\" and his rich and flexible\nvoice gave passion and feeling to the music. Noblet was the \"Fenella,\"\nand her pantomime and dancing were good; but Taglioni spoils one for\nany other dancing.\n\nThe six years that have flown over Noblet since I last saw her have\nleft little trace of their flight, which is to be marvelled at, when\none considers the violent and constant exercise that the profession of\na _danseuse_ demands.\n\nWhen I saw the sylph-like Taglioni floating through the dance, I could\nnot refrain from sighing at the thought that grace and elegance like\nhers should be doomed to know the withering effect of Time; and that\nthose agile limbs should one day become as stiff and helpless as those\nof others. An _old danseuse_ is an anomaly. She is like an old rose,\nrendered more displeasing by the recollection of former attractions.\nThen to see the figure bounding in air, habit and effort effecting\nsomething like that which the agility peculiar to youth formerly\nenabled her to execute almost _con amore_; while the haggard face, and\ndistorted smile revealing yellow teeth, tell a sad tale of departed\nyouth. Yes, an old _danseuse_ is a melancholy object; more so, because\nless cared for, than the broken-down racer, or worn-out hunter.\n\nWent to Tivoli last night, and was amused by the scene of gaiety it\npresented. How unlike, and how superior to, our Vauxhall! People of all\nstations, of all ages, and of both sexes, threading the mazy dance with\na sprightliness that evinced the pleasure it gave them.\n\nWe paused to look at group after group, all equally enjoying\nthemselves; and the Duchesse de Guiche, from her perfect knowledge of\nParis, was enabled, by a glance, to name the station in life occupied\nby each: a somewhat difficult task for a stranger, as the remarkably\ngood taste of every class of women in Paris in dress, precludes those\nstriking contrasts between the appearance of a _modiste_ and a\n_marquise_, the wife of a _boutiquier_ and a _duchesse_, to be met with\nin all other countries.\n\nBut it is not in dress alone that a similarity exists in the exteriors\nof Parisian women. The air _comme il faut_, the perfect freedom from\nall _gaucherie_, the ease of demeanour, the mode of walking, and, above\nall, the decent dignity equally removed from _mauvaise honte_ and\neffrontery, appertain nearly alike to all. The class denominated\n_grisettes_ alone offered an exception, as their demonstrations of\ngaiety, though free from boisterousness, betrayed stronger symptoms of\nhilarity than were evinced by women belonging to a more elevated class\nin society.\n\nThe dancing, too, surprised as well as pleased me; and in this\naccomplishment the French still maintain their long-acknowledged\nsuperiority, for among the many groups I did not see a single bad\ndancer.\n\nAround one quadrille party a more numerous audience was collected than\naround the others, and the _entrechats_ of one of the gentlemen were\nmuch applauded. Nods and smiles passing between the dancers and the\nDuchesse de Guiche, revealed to me that they were among the circle of\nher acquaintance; and, approaching nearer, I recognised in the\ngentleman whose _entrechats_ were so much admired, my new acquaintance\nthe Marquis l'Espérance de l'Aigle, of whose excellence in the mazy\ndance I now had an opportunity of seeing that Fame had not said too\nmuch.\n\nThe ladies who formed the quadrille were la Marquise de Marmier, the\nVicomtesse de Noailles, and Madame Standish; all excellent dancers, and\nattired in that most becoming of all styles of dress, the\n_demi-toilette_, which is peculiar to France, and admits of the\nafter-dinner promenades or unceremonious visits in which French ladies\nindulge. A simple robe of _organdie_, with long sleeves, a _canezou_ of\nnet, a light scarf, and a pretty _chapeau_ of _paille de riz_, form\nthis becoming toilette, which is considered a suitable one for all\ntheatres, except the Opera, where ladies go in a richer dress.\n\nOn our return from Tivoli, we had a small party to drink tea, and\nremained chatting till one o'clock--a late hour for Paris. Among the\nguests was our old friend Mr. T. Steuart, the nephew of Sir William\nDrummond, who continues to be as clever and original as ever. His\nlively remarks and brilliant sallies were very amusing.\n\nHaving complained of the want of a comfortable chair last evening, I\nfound a _chef d'oeuvre_ of Rainguet's in my _salon_ this morning, sent\nme by my thoughtful and ever-kind friend the Duc de Guiche. A\nconnoisseur in chairs and sofas, being unhappily addicted to \"taking\nmine ease\" not only in \"mine inn,\" but wherever I meet these requisites\nto it, I am compelled to acknowledge the superiority of Rainguet over\nany that I have previously seen; and my only fear is, that this\nluxurious chair will seduce me into the still greater indulgence of my\nbesetting or _besitting_ sin, sedentary habits.\n\nAt length, we have found a house to suit us, and a delightful one it\nis; once the property of the Maréchal Ney, but now belonging to the\nMarquis de Lillers. It is situated in the Rue de Bourbon, but the\nwindows of the principal apartments look on the Seine, and command a\ndelightful view of the Tuilerie Gardens. It is approached by an avenue\nbounded by fine trees, and is enclosed on the Rue de Bourbon side by\nhigh walls, a large _porte-cochère_, and a porter's lodge; which give\nit all the quiet and security of a country house.\n\nThis hôtel may be viewed as a type of the splendour that marked the\ndwellings of the imperial _noblesse_, and some notion of it may be\nconceived from the fact that the decorations of its walls alone cost a\nmillion of francs. These decorations are still--thanks to the purity of\nthe air of Paris--as fresh as if only a year painted, and are of great\nbeauty; so much so, that it will be not only very expensive but very\ndifficult to assort the furniture to them; and, unfortunately, there is\nnot a single _meuble_ in the house.\n\nThe rent is high, but there are so many competitors for the hôtel,\nwhich has only been three days in the market, that we consider\nourselves fortunate in having secured it.\n\nA small garden, or rather terrace, with some large trees and plenty of\nflowers, separates the house from the Quai d'Orsay, and runs back at\nits left angle. The avenue terminates in a court, from which, on the\nright, a gate opens into the stable offices; and a vestibule, fitted up\nas a conservatory, forms an entrance to the house. A flight of marble\nsteps on each side of the conservatory, leads to a large ante-room,\nfrom which a window of one immense plate of glass, extending from the\nceiling to the floor, divides the centre, permitting the pyramids of\nflowers to be seen through it. A glass door on each side opens from the\nvestibule to the steps of the conservatory.\n\nThe vestibule, lofty and spacious, is lighted also by two other\nwindows, beyond the conservatory, and is ornamented with pilasters with\nCorinthian capitals.\n\nOn the right hand is the _salle à manger_, a fine room, lighted by\nthree windows looking into the court-yard, and architecturally arranged\nwith pilasters, a rich cornice and ceiling: the hall is stuccoed,\npainted in imitation of marble, and has so fine a polish as really to\ndeceive the eye. In the centre of this apartment is a large door\nbetween the pilasters, opening into a drawing-room, and at the opposite\nend from the door that opens from the vestibule is that which leads to\nthe kitchen offices, and by which dinner is served.\n\n_Vis-à-vis_ to the _salle à manger_, and divided from it by the large\nvestibule, is a dressing and bed-chamber with an alcove, both rooms\nbeing ornamented with columns and pilasters, between which are mirrors\nof large dimensions inserted in recesses. A corridor and _escalier\ndérobé_ at the back of these two apartments admit the attendance of\nservants, without their passing through the vestibule.\n\nIn the centre of this last, and opposite to the large plate of glass\nthat divides it from the conservatory, large folding doors open into\nthe principal drawing-room, which is lighted by three large and lofty\nwindows, the centre one exactly facing the folding doors, and, like\nthem, supported by pilasters.\n\nThis room is of large dimensions, and finely proportioned; the sides\nand ends are divided by fluted pilasters with Corinthian capitals\nrichly gilt. At one extremity is a beautifully sculptured chimney-piece\nof Parian marble, over which is a vast mirror, bounded by pilasters,\nthat separate it from a large panel on each side, in the centre of\nwhich are exquisitely designed allegorical groups.\n\nAt the opposite end, a mirror, of similar dimensions to that over the\nchimney-piece, and resting like it on a white marble slab, occupies the\ncentre, on each side of which are panels with painted groups. Doors at\neach end, and exactly facing, lead into other _salons_; opposite to the\ntwo end windows are large mirrors, resting on marble slabs, bounded by\nnarrow panels with painted figures, and between the windows are also\nmirrors to correspond. The pictorial adornments in this _salon_ are\nexecuted by the first artists of the day, and with a total disregard of\nexpense, so that it is not to be wondered at that they are beautiful.\nMilitary trophies are mingled with the decorations, the whole on a\nwhite ground, and richly ornamented with gilding. The Seine, with its\nboats, and the gay scene of the Tuilerie Gardens, are reflected in the\nmirrors opposite to the windows, while the groups on the panels are\nseen in the others.\n\nNothing can exceed the beauty of this room, in which such fine\nproportion, architectural decoration, and exquisite finish reign, that\nthe eye dwells on it with delight, and can trace no defect.\n\nThe door on the right-hand end, on entering, opens to a less richly\nornamented _salon_, inside which are two admirable bed-chambers and\ndressing-rooms, communicating by an _escalier dérobé_ with a suite of\nservants' apartments.\n\nThe door on the left-hand end of the large _salon_ opens into a\nbeautiful room, known as the _Salle de la Victoire_, from its being\ndecorated by paintings allegorical of Victory. This apartment is\nlighted by two large windows, and opposite to them is a deep recess, or\nalcove.\n\nA cornice extends around the room, about four feet beneath the ceiling,\nand is supported by white columns, projecting into the chamber, on each\nof which stands a figure of Victory offering a wreath of laurels. This\ncornice divides the room from the recess before mentioned.\n\nThe chimney-piece is in a recess, with columns on each side; and the\nlarge mirror over it, and which is finished by the cornice, is faced by\na similar one, also in a recess, with white columns, standing on a\nplinth on each side. The windows are finished by the former cornice,\nthat extends round the rooms, and have similar columns on each side\nwith Victories on them, and a mirror between. The room is white and\ngold, with delicate arabesques, and medallions exquisitely painted.\n\nThis _salon_ communicates with a corridor behind it, which admits the\nattendance of servants without the necessity of their passing through\nthe other apartments. Inside this _salon_ is a _chambre à coucher_,\nthat looks as if intended for some youthful queen, so beautiful are its\ndecorations. A recess, the frieze of which rests on two white columns\nwith silvered capitals, is meant to receive a bed.\n\nOne side of the room is panelled with mirrors, divided by pilasters\nwith silver capitals; and on the opposite side, on which is the\nchimney, similar panels occupy the same space. The colour of the\napartment is a light blue, with silver mouldings to all the panels, and\ndelicate arabesques of silver. The chimney-piece and dogs for the wood\nhave silvered ornaments to correspond.\n\nInside this chamber is the dressing-room, which is of an octagon shape,\nand panelled likewise with mirrors, in front of each of which are white\nmarble slabs to correspond with that of the chimney-piece. The\nmouldings and architectural decorations are silvered, and arabesques of\nflowers are introduced.\n\nThis room opens into a _salle de bain_ of an elliptical form; the bath,\nof white marble, is sunk in the pavement, which is tessellated. From\nthe ceiling immediately over the bath hangs an alabaster lamp, held by\nthe beak of a dove; the rest of the ceiling being painted with Cupids\nthrowing flowers. The room is panelled with alternate mirrors and\ngroups of allegorical subjects finely executed; and is lighted by one\nwindow, composed of a single plate of glass opening into a little spot\nof garden secluded from the rest. A small library completes the suite I\nhave described, all the apartments of which are on the ground floor.\nThere are several other rooms in a wing in the court-yard, and the\nwhole are in perfect order.\n\nI remembered to-day, when standing in the principal drawing-room, the\ntragic scene narrated to me by Sir Robert Wilson as having taken place\nthere, when he had an interview with the Princesse de la Moskowa, after\nthe condemnation of her brave husband.\n\nHe told me, years ago, how the splendour of the decorations of the\n_salon_--decorations meant to commemorate the military glory of the\nMaréchal Ney--added to the tragic effect of the scene in which that\nnoble-minded woman, overwhelmed with horror and grief, turned away with\na shudder from objects that so forcibly reminded her of the brilliant\npast, and so fearfully contrasted with the terrible present.\n\nHe described to me the silence, broken only by the sobs that heaved her\nagonised bosom; the figures of the few trusted friends permitted to\nenter the presence of the distracted wife, moving about with noiseless\nsteps, as if fearful of disturbing the sacredness of that grief to\noffer consolation for which they felt their tongues could form no\nwords, so deeply did their hearts sympathise with it.\n\nHe told me that the images of these friends in the vast mirrors looked\nghostly in the dim twilight of closed blinds, the very light of day\nhaving become insupportable to the broken-hearted wife, so soon to be\nsevered for ever, and by a violent death, from the husband she adored.\nAh, if these walls could speak, what agony would they reveal! and if\nmirrors could retain the shadows replete with despair they once\nreflected, who dare look on them?\n\nI thought of all this to-day, until the tears came into my eyes, and I\nalmost determined not to hire the house, so powerfully did the\nrecollection of the past affect me: but I remembered that such is the\nfate of mankind; that there are no houses in which scenes of misery\nhave not taken place, and in which breaking hearts have not been ready\nto prompt the exclamation \"There is no sorrow like mine.\"\n\nHow is the agony of such moments increased by the recollection that in\nthe same chamber where such bitter grief now reigns, joy and pleasure\nonce dwelt, and that those who shared it can bless us no more! How like\na cruel mockery, then, appear the splendour and beauty of all that\nmeets the eye, unchanged as when it was in unison with our feelings,\nbut which now jars so fearfully with them!\n\nI wonder not that the bereaved wife fled from this house, where every\nobject reminded her of a husband so fondly loved, so fearfully lost, to\nmourn in some more humble abode over the fate of _him_ who could no\nmore resist the magical influence of the presence of that glorious\nchief, who had so often led him to victory, than the war-horse can\nresist being animated by the sound of that trumpet which has often\nexcited the proud animal into ardour.\n\nPeace be to thy manes, gallant Ney; and if thy spirit be permitted to\nlook down on this earth, it will be soothed by the knowledge that the\nwife of thy bosom has remained faithful to thy memory; and that thy\nsons, worthy of their sire--brave, noble, and generous-hearted--are\ndevoted to their country, for which thou hadst so often fought and\nbled!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nTo my surprise and pleasure, I find that a usage exists at Paris which\nI have nowhere else met with, namely, that of letting out rich and fine\nfurniture by the quarter, half, or whole year, in any quantity required\nfor even the largest establishment, and on the shortest notice.\n\nI feared that we should be compelled to buy furniture, or else to put\nup with an inferior sort, little imagining that the most costly can be\nprocured on hire, and even a large mansion made ready for the reception\nof a family in forty-eight hours. This is really like Aladdin's lamp,\nand is a usage that merits being adopted in all capitals.\n\nWe have made an arrangement, that if we decide on remaining in Paris\nmore than a year, and wish to purchase the furniture, the sum agreed to\nbe paid for the year's hire is to be allowed in the purchase-money,\nwhich is to be named when the inventory is made out.\n\nWe saw the house for the first time yesterday; engaged it to-day for a\nyear; to-morrow, the upholsterer will commence placing the furniture in\nit; and to-morrow night we are to sleep in it. This is surely being\nvery expeditious, and saves a world of trouble as well as of wailing.\n\nSpent last evening at Madame Craufurd's. Met there the Prince and\nPrincesse Castelcicala, with their daughter, who is a very handsome\nwoman. The Prince was a long time Ambassador from Naples at the Court\nof St. James, and he now fills the same station at that of France.\n\nThe Princesse is sister to our friend Prince Ischetella at Naples, and,\nlike all her country-women, appears sensible and unaffected. She and\nMademoiselle Dorotea speak English perfectly well, and profess a great\nliking to England and its inhabitants. The Dowager Lady Hawarden, the\nMarquise de Brehan, the Baroness d'Etlingen, Madame d'Ocaris, Lady\nBarbara Craufurd, and Lady Combermere, composed the rest of the female\nportion of the party.\n\nLady Hawarden has been very pretty: what a melancholy phrase is this\nsame _has been_! The Marquise de Brehan is still a very fine woman;\nLady Combermere is very agreeable, and sings with great expression; and\nthe rest of the ladies, always excepting Lady Barbara Craufurd, who is\nvery pretty, were very much like most other ladies of a certain time of\nlife--addicted to silks and blondes, and well aware of their relative\nprices.\n\nMadame Craufurd is very amusing. With all the _naïveté_ of a child, she\npossesses a quick perception of character and a freshness of feeling\nrarely found in a person of her advanced age, and her observations are\nfull of originality.\n\nThe tone of society at Paris is very agreeable. Literature, the fine\narts, and the general occurrences of the day, furnish the topics for\nconversation, from which ill-natured remarks are exploded. A\nceremoniousness of manner, reminding one of _la Vieille Cour_, and\nprobably rendered _à la mode_ by the restoration of the Bourbons,\nprevails; as well as a strict observance of deferential respect from\nthe men towards the women, while these last seem to assume that\nsuperiority accorded to them in manner, if not entertained in fact, by\nthe sterner sex.\n\nThe attention paid by young men to old women in Parisian society is\nvery edifying, and any breach of it would be esteemed nothing short of\na crime. This attention is net evinced by any flattery, except the most\ndelicate--a profound silence when these belles of other days recount\nanecdotes of their own times, or comment on the occurrences of ours, or\nby an alacrity to perform the little services of picking up a fallen\n_mouchoir de poche, bouquet_, or fan, placing a shawl, or handing to a\ncarriage.\n\nIf flirtations exist at Paris, they certainly are not exhibited in\npublic; and those between whom they are supposed to be established\nobserve a ceremonious decorum towards each other, well calculated to\nthrow discredit on the supposition. This appearance of reserve may be\ntermed hypocrisy; nevertheless, even the semblance of propriety is\nadvantageous to the interests of society; and the entire freedom from\nthose marked attentions, engrossing conversations, and from that\nfamiliarity of manner often permitted in England, without even a\nthought of evil on the part of the women who permit these\nindiscretions, leaves to Parisian circles an air of greater dignity and\ndecorum, although I am not disposed to admit that the persons who\ncompose them really possess more dignity or decorum than my\ncompatriots.\n\nCount Charles de Mornay was presented to me to-day. Having heard of him\nonly as--\n\n     \"The glass of fashion and the mould of form,\n     The observed of all observers,\"\n\nI was agreeably surprised to find him one of the most witty,\nwell-informed, and agreeable young men I have ever seen. Gay without\nlevity, well-read without pedantry, and good-looking without vanity. Of\nhow few young men of fashion could this be said! But I am persuaded\nthat Count Charles de Mornay is made to be something better than a mere\nman of fashion.\n\nSpent all the morning in the Hôtel Ney, superintending the placing of\nthe furniture. There is nothing so like the magicians we read of as\nParisian upholsterers; for no sooner have they entered a house, than,\nas if touched by the hand of the enchanter, it assumes a totally\ndifferent aspect. I could hardly believe my eyes when I entered our new\ndwelling, to-day.\n\nAlready were the carpets--and such carpets, too--laid down on the\n_salons_; the curtains were hung; _consoles_, sofas, tables, and chairs\nplaced, and lustres suspended. In short, the rooms looked perfectly\nhabitable.\n\nThe principal drawing-room has a carpet of dark crimson with a\ngold-coloured border, on which is a wreath of flowers that looks as if\nnewly culled from the garden, so rich, varied, and bright are their\nhues. The curtains are of crimson satin, with embossed borders of\ngold-colour; and the sofas, _bergères, fauteuils_, and chairs, richly\ncarved and gilt, are covered with satin to correspond with the\ncurtains.\n\nGilt _consoles_, and _chiffonnières_, with white marble tops, are\nplaced wherever they could be disposed; and, on the chimney pieces, are\nfine _pendules_.\n\nThe next drawing-room, which I have appropriated as my sitting-room, is\nfurnished with blue satin, with rich white flowers. It has a carpet of\na chocolate-coloured ground with a blue border, round which is a wreath\nof bright flowers, and carved and gilt sofas, _bergères_, and\n_fauteuils_, covered with blue satin like the curtains.\n\nThe recess we have lined with fluted blue silk, with a large mirror\nplaced in the centre of it, and five beautiful buhl cabinets around, on\nwhich I intend to dispose all my treasures of old _Sèvre_ china, and\nruby glass.\n\nI was told by the upholsterer, that he had pledged himself to _milord_\nthat _miladi_ was not to see her _chambre à coucher_, or dressing-room,\nuntil they were furnished. This I well knew was some scheme laid by\nLord B. to surprise me, for he delights in such plans.\n\nHe will not tell me what is doing in the rooms, and refuses all my\nentreaties to enter them, but shakes his head, and says he _thinks_ I\nwill be pleased when I see them; and so I think, too, for the only\ncomplaint I ever have to make of his taste is its too great\nsplendour--a proof of which he gave me when I went to Mountjoy Forest\non my marriage, and found my private sitting-room hung with crimson\nGenoa silk velvet, trimmed with gold bullion fringe, and all the\nfurniture of equal richness--a richness that was only suited to a state\nroom in a palace.\n\nWe feel like children with a new plaything, in our beautiful house; but\nhow, after it, shall we ever be able to reconcile ourselves to the\ncomparatively dingy rooms in St. James's Square, which no furniture or\ndecoration could render any thing like the Hôtel Ney?\n\nThe Duc and Duchesse de Guiche leave Paris, to my great regret, in a\nfew days, and will be absent six weeks. He is to command the encampment\nat Luneville, and she is to do the honours--giving dinners, balls,\nconcerts, and soirées, to the ladies who accompany their lords to \"the\ntented field,\" and to the numerous visitors who resort to see it. They\nhave invited us to go to them, but we cannot accept their kindness.\nThey are\n\n     \"On hospitable thoughts intent,\"\n\nand will, I doubt not, conciliate the esteem of all with whom they come\nin contact.\n\nHe is so well bred, that the men pardon his superiority both of person\nand manner; and she is so warm-hearted and amiable, that the women,\nwith a few exceptions, forgive her rare beauty. How we shall miss them,\nand the dear children, too!\n\nDrove in the Bois de Boulogne yesterday, with the Duchesse de Guiche:\nmet my old acquaintance, Lord Yarmouth, who is as amusing and original\nas ever.\n\nHe has great natural talent and knowledge of the world, but uses both\nto little purpose, save to laugh at its slaves. He might be any thing\nhe chose, but he is too indolent for exertion, and seems to think _le\njeu ne vaut pas la chandelle_. He is one of the many clever people\nspoilt by being born to a great fortune and high rank, advantages which\nexclude the necessity of exercising the talents he possesses.\n\nIt is, however, no trifling merit, that born to immense wealth and high\nstation, he should he wholly free from arrogance, or ostentation.\n\nAt length, the secret is out, the doors of my _chambre à coucher_ and\ndressing-room are opened, and I am delighted with both. The whole\nfitting up is in exquisite taste, and, as usual, when my most gallant\nof all gallant husbands that it ever fell to the happy lot of woman to\npossess, interferes, no expense has been spared.\n\nThe bed, which is silvered, instead of gilt, rests on the backs of two\nlarge silver swans, so exquisitely sculptured that every feather is in\nalto-relievo, and looks nearly as fleecy as those of the living bird.\nThe recess in which it is placed is lined with white fluted silk,\nbordered with blue embossed lace; and from the columns that support the\nfrieze of the recess, pale blue silk curtains, lined with white, are\nhung, which, when drawn, conceal the recess altogether.\n\nThe window curtain is of pale blue silk, with embroidered muslin\ncurtains, trimmed with lace inside them, and have borders of blue and\nwhite lace to match those of the recess.\n\nA silvered sofa has been made to fit the side of the room opposite the\nfire-place, near to which stands a most inviting _bergère_. An\n_ècritoire_ occupies one panel, a bookstand the other, and a rich\ncoffer for jewels forms a pendant to a similar one for lace, or India\nshawls.\n\nA carpel of uncut pile, of a pale blue, a silver lamp, and a Psyche\nglass, the ornaments silvered to correspond with the decorations of the\nchamber, complete the furniture. The hangings of the dressing-room are\nof blue silk, covered with lace, and trimmed with rich frills of the\nsame material, as are also the dressing-stools and _chaise longue_, and\nthe carpet and lamp are similar to those of the bed-room.\n\nA toilette table stands before the window, and small _jardinières_ are\nplaced in front of each panel of looking-glass, but so low as not to\nimpede a full view of the person dressing in this beautiful little\nsanctuary.\n\nThe _salle de bain_ is draped with white muslin trimmed with lace, and\nthe sofa and _bergère_ are covered with the same. The bath is of white\nmarble, inserted in the floor, with which its surface is level. On the\nceiling over it, is a painting of Flora scattering flowers with one\nhand while from the other is suspended an alabaster lamp, in the form\nof a lotos.\n\nA more tasteful or elegant suite of apartments cannot be imagined; and\nall this perfection of furniture has been completed in three days! Lord\nB. has all the merit of the taste, and the upholsterer that of the\nrapidity and excellence of the execution.\n\nThe effect of the whole suite is chastely beautiful; and a queen could\ndesire nothing better for her own private apartments. Few queens, most\nprobably, ever had such tasteful ones.\n\nOur kind friend, Charles Mills, has arrived from Rome,--amiable and\nagreeable as ever. He dined with us yesterday, and we talked over the\npleasant days spent in the Vigna Palatina, his beautiful villa.\n\nBreakfasted to-day in the Rue d'Anjou, a take-leave repast given to the\nDuc and Duchesse de Guiche by Madame Craufurd. Lady Barbara and Colonel\nCraufurd were of the party, which was the only _triste_ one I have seen\nin that house. The Duc de Gramont was there, and joined in the regret\nwe all felt at seeing our dear friends drive away.\n\nIt was touching to behold Madame Craufurd, kissing again and again her\ngrandchildren and great-grandchildren, the tears streaming down her\ncheeks, and the venerable Duc de Gramont, scarcely less moved,\nembracing his son and daughter-in-law, and exhorting the latter to take\ncare of her health, while the dear little Ida, his granddaughter, not\nyet two years old, patted his cheeks, and smiled in his face.\n\nIt is truly delightful to witness the warm affection that subsists\nbetween relatives in France, and the dutiful and respectful attention\npaid by children to their parents. In no instance have I seen this more\nstrongly exemplified than in the Duc and Duchesse de Guiche, whose\nunceasing tenderness towards the good Duc de Gramont not only makes his\nhappiness, but is gratifying to all who behold it, as is also their\nconduct to Madame Craufurd.\n\nI wish the encampment was over, and those dear friends back again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nTook possession of our new house to-day, and are delighted with it. Its\nrepose and quiet are very agreeable, after the noise and bustle of the\nRue de Rivoli. Spent several hours in superintending the arrangement of\nmy books, china, _bijouterie_, and flowers, and the rooms look as\nhabitable as if we had lived in them for weeks. How fortunate we are to\nhave found so charming an abode!\n\nA chasm here occurs in my journal, occasioned by the arrival of some\ndear relatives from England, with whom I was too much occupied to have\ntime to journalise. What changes five years effect in young people! The\ndear girls I left children are now grown into women, but are as artless\nand affectionate as in childhood. I could hardly believe my eyes when I\nsaw them, yet I soon traced the same dear countenances, and marvelled\nthat though changed from the round, dimpled ones of infancy, to the\nmore delicate oval of maidenly beauty, the expression of gaiety and\ninnocence of their faces is still the same.\n\nA week has passed rapidly by, and now that they have returned to\nEngland, their visit appears like a dream. I wish it had been longer,\nfor I have seen only enough of them to wish to see a great deal more.\n\nThe good Mrs. W. and her lively, clever, and her pretty daughter, Mrs.\nR., dined with us yesterday. They are _en route_ for England, but give\nmany a sigh to dear Italy. It was pleasant to talk over the happy days\npassed there, which we did with that tender regret with which the past\nis always referred to by those who have sensibility, and they possess\nno ordinary portion of this lovable quality. Les Dames Bellegarde also\ndined with us, and they English friends took a mutual fancy to each\nother. I like the Bellegardes exceedingly.\n\nOur old friend, Lord Lilford, is at Paris, and is as amiable and\nkind-hearted as ever. He dined with us yesterday, and we talked over\nthe pleasant days we spent at Florence. Well-educated, and addicted to\nneither of the prevalent follies of the day, racing nor gaming, he only\nrequires a little ambition to prompt him to exertion, in order to\nbecome a useful, as well as an agreeable member of the community, but\nwith a good fortune and rank, he requires an incentive to action.\n\nMet last evening at Madame Craufurd's the Marquis and Marquise Zamperi\nof Bologna. She is pretty and agreeable, and he is original and\namusing. They were very civil, and expressed regret at not having been\nat Bologna when we were there.\n\nHad a visit from Count Alexandre de Laborde to-day. His conversation is\nlively and entertaining. Full of general information and good sense, he\nis no niggard in imparting the results of both to those with whom he\ncomes in contact, and talks fluently, if not always faultlessly, in\nItalian and English.\n\nThe Marquis de Mornay and his brother Count Charles de Mornay dined\nhere yesterday. How many associations of the olden time are recalled by\nthis ancient and noble name, Mornay du Plessis!\n\nThe Marquis is agreeable, sensible, well-informed, and well-bred.\nThough justly proud of his high descent, the consciousness of it is\nnever rendered visible by any symptom of that arrogance too often met\nwith in those who have less cause for pride, and can only be traced by\na natural dignity and bearing, worthy a descendant of the noble Sully.\n\nCount Charles de Mornay is a very remarkable young man. With a\nbrilliant wit, the sallies of which can \"set the table in a roar;\" it\nis never used at the expense of others, and, when he chooses to be\ngrave, the quickness and justice of his perception, and the fine tact\nand good sense which mark his reflections, betray a mind of no common\norder, and give the promise of future distinction.\n\nNothing can be more agreeable than the mode in which I pass my time\nhere. I read from nine until twelve: order the household arrangements,\nand inspect the _menu_ at twelve: write letters or journalise from one\nuntil four; drive out till six or half-past; return home, dress, dine,\npay visits, or receive them at home, and get to bed at one o'clock.\n\nHow much preferable is the French system of evening visits, to the\nEnglish custom of morning ones, which cut up time so abominably! Few\nwho have lived much abroad could submit patiently to have their\nmornings broken in upon, when evening, which is the most suitable time\nfor relaxation, can be enlivened by the visits that are irksome at\nother hours.\n\nParis is now nearly as empty as London is in September; all the _élite_\nof French fashionable society having taken their departure for their\ncountry houses, or for the different baths they frequent. I, who like\nnot crowds, prefer Paris at this season to any other, and shall be\nrather sorry than glad when it fills again.\n\nMadame Craufurd, Lady Barbara and Colonel Craufurd, the Ducs de\nGramont, Dalberg, and Mouchy, dined with us yesterday. We had music in\nthe evening, The Duc Dalberg is agreeable and well-bred, and his manner\nhas that suavity, mingled with reserve, said to be peculiar to those\nwho have lived much at courts, and filled diplomatic situations.\n\nThe Duc was Minister Plenipotentiary from Baden at Paris, when Napoleon\nwas First Consul, and escaped not censure on the occasion of the\nseizure of the unfortunate Duc d'Enghien; of the intention of which it\nwas thought he ought to have apprised his court, and so have prevented\nan event which has entailed just blame on all concerned in it, as well\nas on some who were innocent.\n\nThere is nothing in the character of the Duc Dalberg to warrant a\nbelief of his being capable of lending himself to aught that was\ndisloyal, for he is an excellent man in all the relations of life, and\nis esteemed and respected by as large a circle of friends as most\npersons who have filled high situations can boast of.\n\nThe Duc de Mouchy is a very amiable as well as high-bred man; he has\nbeen in England, and speaks English with fluency.\n\nLetters from the camp of Luneville, received from our dear friends\nto-day, give a very animated description of their doings there. The Duc\nde Mouchy told me yesterday that they were winning golden opinions from\nall with whom they came in contact there, by their urbanity and\nhospitality. He said that people were not prepared to find the\nhandsomest and most fashionable woman at Paris, \"the observed of all\nobservers,\" and the brightest ornament of the French court, doing the\nhonours to the wives of the officers of the camp with an amiability\nthat has captivated them all. The good Duc de Gramont was delighted at\nhearing this account, for never was there a more affectionate father.\n\nWent with a party yesterday to Montmorency. Madame Craufurd, the\nComtesse de Gand, the Baronne d'Ellingen, Comte F. de Belmont, and our\nown circle, formed the party. It was gratifying to witness how much\ndear Madame Craufurd enjoyed the excursion; she even rode on a donkey\nthrough the woods, and the youngest person of the party did not enter\ninto the amusement with more spirit and gaiety. Montmorency is a\ncharming place, but not so the road to it, which, being paved, is very\ntiresome.\n\nWe visited the hermitage where Rousseau wrote so many of his works, but\nin which this strange and unhappy man found not that peace so long\nsought by him in vain, and to which his own wayward temper and\nsuspicious nature offered an insurmountable obstacle.\n\nAs I sat in this humble abode, and looked around on the objects once\nfamiliar to his eyes, I could not resist the sentiment of pity that\nfilled my breast, at the recollection that even in this tranquil\nasylum, provided by friendship [2], and removed from the turmoil of the\nbusy world, so repugnant to his taste, the jealousies, the\nheart-burnings, and the suspicions, that empoisoned his existence\nfollowed him, rendering his life not only a source of misery to\nhimself, but of pain to others; for no one ever conferred kindness on\nhim without becoming the object of his suspicion, if not of his\naversion.\n\nThe life of Rousseau is one of the most humiliating episodes in the\nwhole history of literary men, and the most calculated to bring genius\ninto disrepute: yet the misery he endured more than avenged the wrongs\nhe inflicted; and, while admiring the productions of a genius, of which\neven his enemies could not deny him the possession, we are more than\never compelled to avow how unavailing is this glorious gift to confer\nhappiness on its owner, or to secure him respect or esteem, if\nunaccompanied by goodness.\n\nWho can reflect on the life of this man without a sense of the danger\nto which Genius exposes its children, and a pity for their sufferings,\nthough too often self-inflicted? Alas! the sensibility which is one of\nthe most invariable characteristics of Genius, and by which its most\nglorious efforts are achieved, if excited into unhealthy action by\nover-exercise, not unseldom renders its possessor unreasonable and\nwretched, while his works are benefiting or delighting others, and\nwhile the very persons who most highly appreciate them are often the\nleast disposed to pardon the errors of their author.\n\nAs the dancer, by the constant practice of her art, soon loses that\nroundness of _contour_ which is one of the most beautiful peculiarities\nof her sex, the muscles of the legs becoming unnaturally developed at\nthe expense of the rest of the figure, so does the man of genius, by\nthe undue exercise of this gift, acquire an irritability that soon\nimpairs the temper, and renders his excess of sensibility a torment to\nhimself and to others.\n\nThe solitude necessary to the exercise of Genius is another fruitful\nsource of evil to its children. Abstracted from the world, they are apt\nto form a false estimate of themselves and of it, and to entertain\nexaggerated expectations from it. Their morbid feelings are little able\nto support the disappointment certain to ensue, and they either rush\ninto a reprisal of imaginary wrongs, by satire on others, or inflict\ntorture on themselves by the belief, often erroneous, of the injuries\nthey have sustained.\n\nI remembered in this abode a passage in one of the best letters ever\nwritten by Rousseau, and addressed to Voltaire, on the subject of his\npoem, entitled _Sur la Loi Naturelle, et sur le Désastre de Lisbonne_;\nin which, referring to an assertion of Voltaire's that few persons\nwould wish to live over again on the condition of enduring the same\ntrials, and which Rousseau combats by urging that it is only the rich,\nfatigued by their pleasures, or literary men, of whom he writes--\"_Des\ngens de lettres, de tous les ordres d'hommes le plus sédentaire, le\nplus malsain, le plus réfléchissant, et, par conséquent, le plus\nmalheureux_,\" who would decline to live over again, had they the power.\n\nThis description of men of letters, written by one of themselves, is a\nmelancholy, but, alas! a true one, and should console the enviers of\ngenius for the want of a gift that but too often entails such misery on\nits possessors.\n\nThe church of Montmorency is a good specimen of Gothic architecture,\nand greatly embellishes the little town, which is built on the side of\na hill, and commands a delicious view of the chestnut forest and\nvalley, clothed with pretty villas, that render it so much and so\njustly admired.\n\nIt was amusing to listen to the diversity of opinions entertained by\nour party relative to Rousseau, as we wandered through the scenes which\nhe so often frequented; each individual censuring or defending him,\naccording to the bias of his or her disposition. On one point all\nagreed; which was, that, if judged by his actions, little could be said\nin mitigation of the conduct of him who, while writing sentiments\nfraught with passion and tenderness, could consign his offspring to a\nfoundling hospital!\n\nHaving visited every object worthy of attention at Montmorency, we\nproceeded to Enghien, to examine the baths established there. The\nbuilding is of vast extent, containing no less than forty chambers,\ncomfortably furnished for the accommodation of bathers; and a good\n_restaurateur_ furnishes the repasts. The apartments command a\nbeautiful view, and the park of St.-Gratien offers a delightful\npromenade to the visitors of Enghien.\n\nOur route back to Paris was rendered very agreeable by the lively and\nclever conversation of the Comtesse de Gand. I have rarely met with a\nmore amusing person.\n\nWith a most retentive memory, she possesses the tact that does not\nalways accompany this precious gift--that of only repeating what is\nperfectly _à propos_ and interesting, with a fund of anecdotes that\nmight form an inexhaustible capital for a professional diner-out to set\nup with; an ill-natured one never escapes her lips, and yet--hear it\nall ye who believe, or act as if ye believe, that malice and wit are\ninseparable allies!--it would be difficult to find a more entertaining\nand lively companion.\n\nOur old friend, Col. E. Lygon, came to see us to-day, and is as amiable\nas ever. He is a specimen of a military man of which England may well\nbe proud.\n\nThe Ducs de Talleyrand and Dino, the Marquis de Mornay, the Marquis de\nDreux-Brezé, and Count Charles de Mornay, dined here yesterday. The\nMarquis de Brezé is a clever man, and his conversation is highly\ninteresting. Well-informed and sensible, he has directed much of his\nattention to politics without being, as is too often the case with\npoliticians, wholly engrossed by them. He appears to me to be a man\nlikely to distinguish himself in public life.\n\nThere could not be found two individuals more dissimilar, or more\nformed for furnishing specimens of the noblemen of _la Vieille Cour_\nand the present time, than the Duc de Talleyrand and the Marquis de\nDreux-Brezé. The Duc, well-dressed and well-bred, but offering in his\ntoilette and in his manners irrefragable evidence that both have been\nstudied, and his conversation bearing that high polish and urbanity\nwhich, if not always characteristics of talent, conceal the absence of\nit, represents _l'ancien régime_, when _les grands seigneurs_ were more\ndesirous to serve _les belles dames_ than their country, and more\nanxious to be distinguished in the _salons_ of the Faubourg St.-Germain\nthan in the _Chambre de Parlement_.\n\nThe Marquis de Dreux-Brezé, well-dressed and well-bred, too, appears\nnot to have studied either his toilette or his manners; and, though by\nno means deficient in polite attention to women, seems to believe that\nthere are higher and more praiseworthy pursuits than that of thinking\nonly how to please them, and bestows more thought on the _Chambre des\nPairs_ than on the _salons à la mode_.\n\nOne is a passive and ornamental member of society, the other a useful\nand active politician, I have remarked that the Frenchmen of high birth\nof the present time all seem disposed to take pains in fitting\nthemselves for the duties of their station. They read much and with\nprofit, travel much more than formerly, and are free from the narrow\nprejudices against other countries, which, while they prove not a man's\nattachment to his own, offer one of the most insurmountable of all\nbarriers to that good understanding so necessary to be maintained\nbetween nations.\n\nDined yesterday at St.-Cloud with the Baron and Baroness de Ruysch; a\nvery agreeable and intellectual pair, who have made a little paradise\naround them in the shape of an English pleasure ground, blooming with\nrare shrubs and flowers.\n\nOur old friend, Mr. Douglas Kinnaird--\"the honourable Dug,\" as poor\nLord Byron used to call him--paid me a visit to-day. I had not seen him\nfor seven years, and these same years have left their traces on his\nbrow. He is in delicate health, and is only come over to Paris for a\nvery few days.\n\nHe has lived in the same scenes and in the same routine that we left\nhim, wholly engrossed by them, while\n\n     \"I've taught me other tongues, and in strange eyes\n     Have made me not a stranger;\"\n\nand wonder how people can be content to dwell whole years in so\ncircumscribed, however useful, a circle.\n\nThose who live much in London seem to me to have tasted the lotus\nwhich, according to the fable of old, induced forgetfulness of the\npast, so wholly are they engrossed by the present, and by the vortex in\nwhich they find themselves plunged.\n\nMuch as I like England, and few love it more dearly, I should not like\nto pass all the rest of my life in it. _All, all_: it is thus we ever\ncount on futurity, reckoning as if our lives were certain of being\nprolonged, when we know not that the _all_ on which we so boldly\ncalculate may not be terminated in a day, nay, even in an hour. Who is\nthere that can boast an English birth, that would not wish to die at\nhome and rest in an English grave?\n\nSir Francis Burdett has arrived, and means to stay some time here. He\ncalled on us yesterday with Colonel Leicester Stanhope, and is as\nagreeable and good-natured as ever. He is much _fêted_ at Paris, and\nreceives great attention from the Duc d'Orléans, who has offered him\nhis boxes at the theatres, and shews him all manner of civilities.\n\nColonel Leicester Stanhope gave me some interesting details of poor\nByron's last days in Greece, and seems to have duly appreciated his\nmany fine qualities, in spite of the errors that shrouded but could not\neclipse them. The fine temper and good breeding that seem to be\ncharacteristic of the Stanhope family, have not degenerated in this\nbranch of it; and his manner, as well as his voice and accent, remind\nme very forcibly of my dear old friend his father, who is one of the\nmost amiable, as well as agreeable men I ever knew, and who I look\nforward with pleasure to meeting on my return home.\n\nThe Marquise Palavicini from Genoa, her daughter-in-law the Princesse\nDoria, sir Francis Burdett, and Colonel Leicester Stanhope, dined with\nus yesterday. The marquise Palavicini is a very sensible and agreeable\nwoman, and the Princesse Doria is very pretty and amiable. Like most of\nher countrywomen, this young and attractive person is wholly free from\nthat affectation which deteriorates from so many of the women of other\ncountries; and the simplicity of her manner, which is as remote from\n_gaucherie_ as it is from affectation, invests her with a peculiar\ncharm.\n\nWe talked over Genoa, where we have spent so many pleasant days, and\nthe beautiful gardens of the villa Palavicini, the possession of which\nhas always tempted me to envy its owner. I have never passed an hour in\nthe society of Italian women without feeling the peculiar charm of\ntheir manner, and wishing that its ease and simplicity were more\ngenerally adopted.\n\nThe absence of any effort to shine, the gentleness without insipidity,\nthe liveliness without levity, and above all, the perfect good nature\nthat precludes aught that could be disagreeable to others, form the\ndistinguishing characteristics of the manner of Italian women from the\nprincess to the peasant, and are alike practised by both towards all\nwith whom they converse.\n\nLord Darnley and Lord Charlemont dined here yesterday. It is pleasant\nto see old and familiar faces again, even though the traces of Time on\ntheir brows recall to mind the marks which the ruthless tyrant must\nhave inflicted on our own. We all declared that we saw no change in\neach other, but the looks of surprise and disappointment exchanged at\nmeeting contradicted the assertion.\n\nMr. Charles Young, the tragedian, dined here to-day. We were very glad\nto see him again, for he is a very estimable as well as agreeable\nmember of society, and reflects honour on his profession.\n\nLord Lansdowne came here with Count Flahault this evening. It is now\nseven years since I last saw him, but time has dealt kindly with him\nduring that period, as it ever does to those who possess equanimity of\nmind and health of body. Lord Lansdowne has always appeared to me to be\npeculiarly formed for a statesman.\n\nWith a fortune that exempts him from incurring even the suspicion of\nmercenary motives for holding office, and a rank which precludes that\nof entertaining the ambition of seeking a higher, he is free from the\nangry passions that more or loss influence the generality of other men.\nTo an unprejudiced mind, he joins self-respect without arrogance,\nself-possession without effrontery, solid and general information,\nconsiderable power of application to business, a calm and gentlemanly\ndemeanour, and an urbanity of manner which, while it conciliates good\nwill, never descends to, or encourages, familiarity.\n\nA lover and liberal patron of the fine arts, he is an encourager of\nliterature, and partial to the society of literary men; irreproachable\nin private life, and respected in public, what is there wanting to\nrender him faultless?\n\nI, who used to enjoy a good deal of his society in England, am of\nopinion, that the sole thing wanting is the warmth and cordiality of\nmanner which beget friends and retain partisans, and without which no\nminister can count on constant supporters.\n\nIt is a curious circumstance, that the political party to which Lord\nLansdowne is opposed can boast a man among those most likely to hold\nthe reins of government, to whom all that I have said of Lord Lansdowne\nmight, with little modification, be applied. I refer to Sir Robert\nPeel, whose acquaintance I enjoyed in England; and who is much younger,\nand perhaps bolder, than Lord Lansdowne.\n\nHappy, in my opinion, is the country which possesses such men; though\nthe friends and admirers of each would probably feel little disposed to\nadmit any comparison to be instituted between them, and would deride,\nif not assail, any one for making it.\n\nSir Francis Burdell dined here yesterday, and we had the Count\nAlexandra de Laborde and Count Charles de Mornay, to meet him. Several\npeople came in the evening. I have lent a pile of books to Sir F. B.,\nwho continues to read as much as formerly, and forgets nothing that he\nperuses. His information is, consequently, very extensive, and renders\nhis conversation very interesting. His thirst for knowledge is\ninsatiable, and leads him to every scientific resort where it may be\ngratified.\n\nSpent last evening at Madame Craufurd's. Met there, the Princesse\nCastelcicala and her daughter, Lady Drummond, Mr. T. Steuart, and\nvarious others--among them, a daughter of the Marquess of Ailesbury,\nwho has married a French nobleman, and resides in Paris.\n\nLady Drummond talked to me a good deal of Sir William, and evinced much\nrespect for his memory. She is proud, and she may well be so, of having\nbeen the wife of such a man; though there was but little sympathy\nbetween their tastes and pursuits, and his death can produce so little\nchange in her habits of life, that she can scarcely be said to miss\nhim.\n\nHe passed his days and the greater portion of his nights in reading or\nwriting, living in a suite of rooms literally filled with books; the\ntables, chairs, sofas, and even the floors, being encumbered with them,\ngoing out only for a short time in a carriage to get a little air, or\noccasionally to dine out.\n\nHe seldom saw Lady Drummond, except at dinner, surrounded by a large\nparty. She passed, as she still passes her time, in the duties of an\nelaborate toilette, paying or receiving visits, giving or going to\n_fêtes_, and playing with her lap-dog. A strange wife for one of the\nmost intellectual men of his day! And yet this total dissimilarity\nproduced no discord between them; for she was proud of his\nacquirements, and he was indulgent to her less _spirituelle_ tastes.\n\nLady Drummond does much good at Naples; for, while the _beau monde_ of\nthat gay capital are entertained in a style of profuse hospitality at\nher house, the poor find her charity dispensed with a liberal hand in\nall their exigencies; so that her vast wealth is a source of comfort to\nothers as well as to herself.\n\nI have been reading _Vivian Grey_--a very wild, but very clever\nbook, full of genius in its unpruned luxuriance; the writer revels\nin all the riches of a brilliant imagination, and expends them\nprodigally--dazzling, at one moment, by his passionate eloquence, and,\nat another, by his touching pathos.\n\nA pleasant dinner-party, yesterday. The Duc de Mouchy, the Marquis de\nMornay, Count Flahault, the Count Maussion, Mons. de Montrond, and Mr.\nStandish, were the guests. Count Flahault is so very agreeable and\ngentlemanly a man, that no one can call in question the taste of the\nBaroness Keith in selecting him for her husband.\n\nMr. Standish has married a French lady, accomplished, clever, and\npretty. Intermarriages between French and English are now not\nunfrequent; and it is pleasant to observe the French politeness and\n_bon ton_ ingrafted on English sincerity and good sense. Of this, Mr.\nStandish offers a very good example; for, while he has acquired all the\nParisian ruse of manner, he has retained all the English good qualities\nfor which he has always been esteemed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nCharles Kemble dined here yesterday, and in the evening read to us his\ndaughter Fanny's Tragedy of _Francis the First_--a very wonderful\nproduction for so young a girl. There is considerable vigour in many\nparts of this work, and several passages in it reminded me of the old\ndramatists. The character of \"Louisa of Savoy\" is forcibly\ndrawn--wonderfully so, indeed, when considered as the production of so\nyouthful a person. The constant association with minds deeply imbued\nwith a love of the old writers, must have greatly influenced the taste\nof Miss Kemble.\n\n_Francis the First_ bears irrefragable evidence that her reading has\nlain much among the old poets, and that Shakspeare is one of her most\nfavourite ones. \"Triboulet,\" the king's jester, may be instanced as an\nexample of this; and \"Margaret of Valois\" furnishes another. \"Françoise\nde Foix\" is a more original conception; timid, yet fond, sacrificing\nher honour to save her brother's life, but rendered wretched by\nremorse; and not able to endure the presence of her affianced husband,\nwho, believing her pure and sinless as he left her, appeals to her,\nwhen \"Gonzales\" reveals her shame.\n\nThis same \"Gonzales,\" urged on by vengeance, and ready to do\naught--nay, more than \"may become a man,\"--to seek its gratification,\nis a boldly drawn character.\n\nThe introduction of the poet \"Clément Marot\" is no less happy than\njudicious; and Miss Kemble gives him a very beautiful speech, addressed\nto his master \"Francis the First,\" in which the charm that reigns about\nthe presence of a pure woman is so eloquently described, as to have\nreminded me of the exquisite passage in _Comus_, although there is not\nany plagiary in Miss Kemble's speech.\n\nA poetess herself, she has rendered justice to the character of Clement\nMarot, whose honest indignation at being employed to bear a letter from\nthe amorous \"Francis\" to the sister of \"Lautrec,\" she has very\ngracefully painted.\n\nThe \"Constable Bourbon\" is well drawn, and has some fine speeches\nassigned to him; and \"Gonzales\" gives a spirited description of the\ndifference between encountering death in the battle-field, surrounded\nby all the spirit-stirring \"pomp and circumstance of glorious war,\" and\nmeeting the grisly tyrant on the scaffold, attended by all the\nignominious accessories of a traitor's doom.\n\nThis Tragedy, when given to the public, will establish Miss Kemble's\nclaims to distinction in the literary world, and add another laurel to\nthose acquired by her family.\n\nThere are certain passages in the speeches of \"Gonzales,\" that, in my\nopinion, require to be revised, lest they should provoke censures from\nthe fastidious critics of the present time, who are prone to detect\nevil of which the authors, whose works they analyse, are quite\nunconscious. Innocence sometimes leads young writers to a freedom of\nexpression from which experienced ones would shrink back in alarm; and\nthe perusal of the old dramatists gives a knowledge of passions, and of\nsins, known only through their medium, but the skilful developement of\nwhich, subjects a female writer, and more particularly a youthful one,\nto ungenerous animadversion. It is to be hoped, that the friends of\nthis gifted girl will so prune the luxuriance of her pen, as to leave\nnothing to detract from a work so creditable to her genius.\n\nCharles Kemble rendered ample justice to his daughter's Tragedy by his\nmode of reading it; and we counted not the hours devoted to the task.\nHow many reminiscences of the olden time were called up by hearing him!\n\nI remembered those pleasant evenings when he used to read to us in\nLondon, hour after hour, until the timepiece warned us to give over. I\nremembered, too, John Kemble--\"the great John Kemble,\" as Lord\nGuildford used to call him--twice or thrice reading to us with Sir T.\nLawrence; and the tones of Charles Kemble's voice, and the expression\nof his face, forcibly reminded me of our departed friend.\n\nI have scarcely met with a more high-bred man, or a more agreeable\ncompanion, than Charles Kemble. Indeed, were I called on to name the\nprofessional men I have known most distinguished for good breeding and\nmanners, I should name our four tragedians,--the two Kembles, Young,\nand Macready.\n\nSir Francis Burdett dined here yesterday _en famille_, and we passed\ntwo very pleasant hours. He related to us many amusing and interesting\nanecdotes connected with his political life.\n\nWent to the Opera in the evening, whither he accompanied us. I like my\nbox very much. It is in the centre of the house, is draped with pale\nblue silk, and has very comfortable chairs. The Parisians are, I find,\nas addicted to staring as the English; for many were the glasses\nlevelled last night at Sir Francis Burdett who, totally unconscious of\nthe attention he excited, was wholly engrossed by the \"Count Ory,\" some\nof the choruses in which pleased me very much.\n\nA visit to-day from our excellent and valued friend, Sir A. Barnard,\nwho has promised to dine with us to-morrow. Paris is now filling very\nfast, which I regret, as I dislike crowds and having my time broken in\nupon.\n\nI become more convinced every day I live, that quiet and repose are the\nsecrets of happiness, for I never feel so near an approach to this\nblessing as when in the possession of them. General society is a heavy\ntax on time and patience, and one that I feel every year less\ninclination to pay, as I witness the bad effect it produces not only on\nthe habits but on the mind.\n\nOh! the weariness of listening for hours to the repetition of past\ngaieties, or the anticipation of future ones, to the commonplace\nremarks or stupid conversation of persons whose whole thoughts are\nengrossed by the frivolous amusements of Paris, which are all and every\nthing to them!\n\nHow delicious is it to shut out all this weariness, and with a book, or\na few rationally minded friends, indulge in an interchange of ideas!\nBut the too frequent indulgence of this sensible mode of existence\nexposes one to the sarcasms of the frivolous who are avoided.\n\nOne is deemed a pedant--a terrible charge at Paris!--or a _bas bleu_,\nwhich is still worse, however free the individual may be from any\npretensions to merit such charges.\n\nPaid a visit to the justly celebrated Mademoiselle Mars yesterday, at\nher beautiful hôtel in the Rue de la Tour des Dames. I have entertained\na wish ever since my return from Italy, to become acquainted with this\nremarkable woman; and Mr. Young was the medium of accomplishing it.\n\nMademoiselle Mars is even more attractive off the stage than on; for\nher countenance beams with intelligence, and her manners are at once so\nanimated, yet gentle; so kind, yet dignified; and there is such an\ninexpressible charm in the tones of her voice, that no one can approach\nwithout being delighted with her.\n\nHer conversation is highly interesting, marked by a good sense and good\ntaste that render her knowledge always available, but never obtrusive.\nHer features are regular and delicate; her figure, though inclined to\n_embonpoint_, is very graceful, and her smile, like the tones of her\nvoice, is irresistibly sweet, and reveals teeth of rare beauty.\nMademoiselle Mars, off the stage, owes none of her attractions to the\nartful aid of ornament; wearing her own dark hair simply arranged, and\nher clear brown complexion free from any artificial tinge. In her air\nand manner is the rare and happy mixture of _la grande dame et la femme\naimable_, without the slightest shade of affectation.\n\nMademoiselle Mars' hôtel is the prettiest imaginable. It stands in a\ncourt yard, wholly shut in from the street; and, though not vast, it\nhas all the elegance, if not the splendour, of a fine house. Nothing\ncan evince a purer taste than this dwelling, with its decorations and\nfurniture. It contains all that elegance and comfort can require,\nwithout any thing meretricious or gaudy, and is a temple worthy of the\ngoddess to whom it is dedicated.\n\nIt has been well observed, that a just notion of the character of a\nperson can always be formed by the style of his or her dwelling. Who\ncan be deceived in the house of a _nouveau riche_? Every piece of\nfurniture in it vouches, not only for the wealth of its owner, but that\nhe has not yet got sufficiently habituated to the possession of it, to\nbe as indifferent to its attributes as are those to whom custom has\nrendered splendour no longer a pleasure.\n\nEvery thing in the house of Mademoiselle Mars bespeaks its mistress to\nbe a woman of highly cultivated mind and of refined habits.\n\nThe boudoir is in the style of Louis XIV, and owes its tasteful\ndecorations to the pencil of Ciceri. The pictures that ornament it are\nby Gérard, and are highly creditable to his reputation. The library\nserves also as a picture-gallery; and in it may be seen beautiful\nspecimens of the talents of the most esteemed French artists, offered\nby them as a homage to this celebrated woman. Gérard, Delacroix,\nIsabey, Lany, Grévedon, and other distinguished artists, have\ncontributed to this valuable collection. A fine portrait of Madame\nPasta, and another of Talma, with two exquisite pictures of the mother\nof Mademoiselle Mars, not less remarkable for the rare beauty of the\nsubject than for the merit of the artists, complete it.\n\nOne book-case in the library contains only the presentation copies of\nthe pieces in which Mademoiselle Mars has performed, magnificently\nbound by the authors.\n\nOn a white marble _console_ in this gallery is placed an interesting\nmemorial of her brilliant theatrical career, presented to her by the\nmost enthusiastic of its numerous admirers. It consists of a laurel\ncrown, executed in pure gold; on the leaves of which are engraved on\none side, the name of each piece in which she appeared, and, on the\nother, the _rôle_ which she acted in it. A very fine statue of Molière\nis placed in this apartment.\n\nNever did two hours glide more rapidly away than those passed in the\nsociety of this fascinating woman, whose presence I left penetrated\nwith the conviction that no one can know without admiring her; and that\nwhen she retires from the stage, \"we shall not look upon her like\nagain.\"\n\nPassed a very agreeable evening, at Madame Craufurd's, Met there la\nDuchesse de la Force, and the usual circle of _habitués_. Talking of\ntheatres, some of _la Vieille Cour_, who happened to be present,\nremarked on the distinction always made between the female performers\nof the different ones. Those of the Théâtre Français were styled \"_Les\nDames de la Comédie Française_\"; \"those of the Théâtre Italien,\" \"_Les\nDemoiselles du Théâtre Italien_;\" and the dancers, \"_Les Filles de\nl'Opéra_.\" This last mode of naming _les danseuses_, though in later\ntimes considered as a reproach, was, originally, meant as an honourable\ndistinction; the king, on establishing the _Académie Royale de\nMusique_, having obtained the privilege that the performers attached to\nit should be exempt from excommunication. Hence they were named, \"_Les\nFilles de l'Opéra_,\" as persons sometimes said \"_Les Filles de la\nReine_.\"\n\n_À propos_ of the Opera, Madame Grassini, once no less celebrated for\nher beauty than for her voice, was of the party last night. She is, and\ndeservedly, a general favourite in Parisian society, in which her\nvivacity, good-nature, and amiability, are duly appreciated. Her lively\nsallies and _naïve_ remarks are very amusing; and the frankness and\nsimplicity she has preserved in a profession and position so calculated\nto induce the reverse, add to her attractions and give piquancy to her\nconversation.\n\nThere are moments in which Madame Grassini's countenance becomes\nlighted up with such animation, that it seems to be invested with a\nconsiderable portion of the rare beauty for which she was so\nremarkable.\n\nHer eyes are still glorious, and, like those only of the sunny South,\ncan flash with intelligence, or melt with tenderness. It is when\nconversing on the grand _rôles_ which she filled as _prima donna_, that\nher face lights up as I have noticed,--as the war-horse, when hearing\nthe sound of the trumpet, remembers the scene of his past glory.\n\nWhen in Italy, some years since, Madame Grassini's carriage was stopped\nby brigands, who, having compelled her to descend, ransacked it and\ntook possession of her splendid theatrical wardrobe, and her\nmagnificent diamonds.\n\nShe witnessed the robbery with calmness, until she saw the brigands\nseize the portrait of the Emperor Napoleon, presented to her by his own\nhand, and set round with large brilliants, when she appealed to them\nwith tears streaming down her cheeks to take the settings and all the\ndiamonds, but not to deprive her of the portrait of her \"dear, dear\nEmperor!\" When this circumstance was referred to she told me the story,\nand her eyes glistened with tears while relating it.\n\nWent to Orsay yesterday, and passed a very agreeable day there. It was\na fortified chateau, and must have been a very fine place before the\nRevolution caused, not only its pillage, but nearly total destruction,\nfor only one wing of it now remains.\n\nBuilt in the reign of Charles VII, it was esteemed one of the best\nspecimens of the feudal _château fort_ of that epoch; and the\nsubterranean portion of it still attests its former strength and\nmagnitude.\n\nIt is surrounded by a moat, not of stagnant water, but supplied by the\nriver Ivette, which flows at the base of the hill on which the château\nstands. The water is clear and brisk and the château looks as if it\nstood in a pellucid river. The view from the windows is very extensive,\ncommanding a rich and well-wooded country.\n\nThe chapel escaped not the ravages of the sacrilegious band, who\ncommitted such havoc on the château; for the beautiful altar, and some\nvery interesting monuments, were barbarously mutilated, and the tomb of\nthe Princesse de Croy, the mother of General Count d'Orsay, on which a\nvast sum had been expended, was nearly razed to the ground.\n\nIf aught was required to increase my horror of revolutions, and of the\nbaleful consequences to which they lead, the sight of this once\nsplendid château, and, above all, of its half-ruined chapel, in which\neven the honoured dead were insulted, would have accomplished it.\n\nAn heiress of one of the most ancient houses in the _Pays-Bas_, the\nPrincesse de Croy brought a noble dowry to her husband, himself a man\nof princely fortune. Young and beautiful, her munificence soon rendered\nher an object of almost, adoration to the dependents of her lord; and\nwhen soon after having given birth to a son and heir, the present\nGeneral Comte d'Orsay, she was called to another world, her remains\nwere followed to her untimely grave by a long train of weeping poor,\nwhose hearts her bounty had often cheered, and whose descendants were\nsubsequently horror-struck to see the sanctity of her last earthly\nresting-place invaded.\n\nWe passed through the hamlet of Palaiseau, on our return to Paris; and\nsaw in it the steeple where the magpie concealed the silver spoons he\nhad stolen, and which occasioned the event from which the drama of _La\nPie Voleuse_, known in so many languages, has had its origin.\n\nThe real story ended not so happily as the opera, for the poor girl was\nexecuted--the spoons not having been discovered until after her death.\nThis tragedy in humble life has attached great interest to the steeple\nat Palaiseau, and has drawn many persons to the secluded hamlet in\nwhich it stands.\n\nThe Duc and Duchesse de Quiche returned from Luneville yesterday; and\nwe spent last evening with them. The good Duke de Gramont was there,\nand was in great joy at their return. They all dine with us to-morrow;\nand Madame Craufurd comes to meet them.\n\nNever have I seen such children as the Duc de Quiche's. Uniting to the\nmost remarkable personal beauty an intelligence and docility as rare as\nthey are delightful; and never did I witness any thing like the\nunceasing care and attention bestowed on their education by their\nparents.\n\nThose who only know the Duc and Duchesse in the gay circles, in which\nthey are universally esteemed among the brightest ornaments, can form\nlittle idea of them in the privacy of their domestic one--emulating\neach other in their devotion to their children, and giving only the\nmost judicious proofs of their attachment to them. No wonder that the\nworthy Duc de Gramont doats on his grandchildren, and never seems so\nhappy as with his excellent son and daughter-in-law.\n\nWent to the Vaudeville Théâtre last evening, to see the new piece by\nScribe, so much talked of, entitled _Avant_, _Pendant, et Aprés_. There\nis a fearful _vraisemblance_ in some of the scenes with all that one\nhas read or pictured to oneself, as daily occurring during the terrible\ndays of the Revolution; and the tendency of the production is not, in\nmy opinion, calculated to produce salutary effects. I only wonder it is\npermitted to be acted.\n\nThe piece is divided, as the title announces, into three different\nepochs. The first represents the frivolity and vices attributed to the\ndays of _l'ancien régime_, and the _tableau des moeurs_, which is\nvividly coloured, leaves no favourable impression in the minds of the\naudience of that _noblesse_ whose sufferings subsequently expiated the\nerrors said to have accelerated, if not to have produced, the\nRevolution.\n\nNothing is omitted that could cast odium on them, as a preparation for\nthe Reign of Terror that follows. The anarchy and confusion of the\nsecond epoch--the fear and horror that prevail when the voices and\nmotions of a sanguinary mob are heard in the streets, and the terrified\ninmates of the houses are seen crouching in speechless terror, are\ndisplayed with wonderful truth.\n\nThe lesson is an awful, and I think a dangerous, one, and so seemed to\nthink many of the upper class among the audience, for I saw some fair\ncheeks turn pale, and some furrowed brows look ominous, as the scene\nwas enacted, while those of the less elevated in rank among the\nspectators assumed, or seemed to assume, a certain _fierté_, if not\nferocity, of aspect, at beholding this vivid representation of the\ntriumph achieved by their order over the _noblesse_.\n\nIt is not wise to exhibit to a people, and above all to so inflammable\na people as the French, what _they_ can effect; and I confess I felt\nuneasy when I witnessed the deep interest and satisfaction evinced by\nmany in the _parterre_ during the representation.\n\nThe _Après_, the third epoch, is even more calculated to encourage\nrevolutionary principles, for in it was displayed the elevation to the\nhighest grades in the army and in the state of those who in the _ancien\nrégime_ would have remained as the Revolution found them, in the most\nobscure stations, but who by that event had brilliant opportunities\nafforded for distinguishing themselves.\n\nHeroic courage, boundless generosity, and devoted patriotism, are\nliberally bestowed on the actors who figure in this last portion of the\ndrama; and, as these qualities are known to have appertained to many of\nthose who really filled the _rôles_ enacted at the period now\nrepresented, the scene had, as might be expected, a powerful effect on\na people so impressible as the French, and so liable to be hurried into\nenthusiasm by aught that appeals to their imaginations.\n\nThe applause was deafening; and I venture to say, that those from whom\nit proceeded left the theatre with a conviction that a revolution was a\ncertain means of achieving glory and fortune to those who, with all the\nself-imagined qualities to merit both, had not been born to either.\n\nEvery Frenchman in the middle or lower class believes himself capable\nof arriving at the highest honours. This belief sometimes half\naccomplishes the destiny it imagines; but even when it fails to effect\nthis, it ever operates in rendering Frenchmen peculiarly liable to rush\ninto any change or measure likely to lead to even a chance of\ndistinction.\n\nAs during the performance of _Avant, Pendant et Après_, my eye glanced\non the faces of some of the emigrant _noblesse_, restored to France by\nthe entry of the Bourbons, I marked the changes produced on their\ncountenances by it. Anxiety, mingled with dismay, was visible; for the\nscenes of the past were vividly recalled, while a vague dread of the\nfuture was instilled. Yes, the representation of this piece is a\ndangerous experiment, and so I fear it will turn out.\n\nI am sometimes amused, but more frequently irritated, by observing the\n_moeurs Parisiennes_, particularly in the shop-keepers. The airs of\nself-complacency, amounting almost to impertinence, practised by this\nclass, cannot fail to surprise persons accustomed to the civility and\nassiduity of those in London, who, whether the purchases made in their\nshops be large or small, evince an equal politeness to the buyers.\n\nIn Paris, the tradesman assumes the right of dictating to the taste of\nhis customers; in London, he only administers to it. Enter a Parisian\nshop, and ask to be shewn velvet, silk, or riband, to assort with a\npattern you have brought of some particular colour or quality, and the\nmercer, having glanced at it somewhat contemptuously, places before you\nsix or eight pieces of a different tint and texture.\n\nYou tell him that they are not similar to the pattern, and he answers,\n\"That may be; nevertheless, his goods are of the newest fashion, and\ninfinitely superior to your model.\" You say, \"You prefer the colour of\nyour pattern, and must match it.\" He produces half-a-dozen pieces still\nmore unlike what you require; and to your renewed assertion that no\ncolour but the one similar to your pattern will suit you, he assures\nyou, that his goods are superior to all others, and that what you\nrequire is out of fashion, and a very bad article, and, consequently,\nthat you had much better abandon your taste and adopt his. This counsel\nis given without any attempt at concealing the contempt the giver of it\nentertains for your opinion, and the perfect satisfaction he indulges\nfor his own.\n\nYou once more ask, \"If he has got nothing to match the colour you\nrequire?\" and he shrugs his shoulders and answers, \"_Pourtant_, madame,\nwhat I have shewn you is much superior,\" \"Very possible; but no colour\nwill suit me but this one,\" holding up the pattern; \"for I want to\nreplace a breadth of a new dress to which an accident has occurred.\"\n\n\"_Pourtant_, madame, my colours are precisely the same, but the quality\nof the materials is infinitely better!\" and with this answer, after\nhaving lost half an hour--if not double that time--you are compelled to\nbe satisfied, and leave the shop, its owner looking as if he considered\nyou a person of decidedly bad taste, and very troublesome into the\nbargain.\n\nSimilar treatment awaits you in every shop; the owners having, as it\nappears to me, decided on shewing you only what _they_ approve, and not\nwhat you seek. The women of high rank in France seldom, if ever, enter\nany shop except that of Herbault, who is esteemed the _modiste, par\nexcellence_, of Paris, and it is to this habit, probably, that the want\nof _bienséance_ so visible in Parisian _boutiquiers_, is to be\nattributed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\nAn agreeable party dined here yesterday--Lord Stuart de Rothesay, our\nAmbassador, the Duc and Duchesse de Guiche, the Duc de Mouchy, Sir\nFrancis Burdett, and Count Charles de Mornay. Lord Stuart de Rothesay\nis very popular at Paris, as is also our Ambassadress; a proof that, in\naddition to a vast fund of good-nature, no inconsiderable portion of\ntact is conjoined--to please English and French too, which they\ncertainly do, requires no little degree of the rare talent of\n_savoir-vivre_.\n\nTo a profound knowledge of French society and its peculiarities, a\nknowledge not easily acquired, Lord and Lady Stuart de Rothesay add the\nhappy art of adopting all that is agreeable in its usages, without\nsacrificing any of the stateliness so essential in the representatives\nof our more grave and reflecting nation.\n\nAmong the peculiarities that most strike one in French people, are the\ngood-breeding with which they listen, without even a smile, to the\nalmost incomprehensible attempts at speaking French made by many\nstrangers, and the quickness of apprehension with which they seize\ntheir meaning, and assist them in rendering the sense complete.\n\nI have seen innumerable proofs of this politeness--a politeness so\nlittle understood, or at least so little practised, among the English,\nthat mistakes perfectly ludicrous, and which could not have failed to\nset my compatriots in a titter, if not in a roar, have not produced the\nmovement of a single risible muscle, and yet the French are more prone\nto gaiety than are the English.\n\nMr. D---- and Mr. T---- dined here yesterday. The former, mild,\ngentlemanlike, and unostentatious, seems to forget what so many would,\nif similarly situated, remember with arrogance, namely, that he is\nimmensely rich; an obliviousness that, in my opinion, greatly enhances\nhis other merits.\n\nMr. T---- is little changed since I last saw him, and is well-informed,\nclover, and agreeable,--but his own too-evident consciousness of\npossessing these recommendations prevents other people from according\nhim due merit for them.\n\nIn society, one who believes himself clever must become a hypocrite,\nand so conceal all knowledge of his self-complacency, if he wishes to\navoid being unpopular; for woe be to him who lets the world see he\nthinks highly of himself, however his abilities may justify his\nself-approval!\n\nThe sight of Mr. T---- recalled his amiable and excellent mother to my\nmemory. I never esteemed any woman more highly, or enjoyed the society\nof any other person more than hers. How many pleasant hours have I\npassed with her! I so well remember John Kemble fancying that if I went\nthrough a course of reading Shakspeare with his sister Mrs. T----, I\nshould make, as he said, a fine actress; and we were to get up private\ntheatricals at Mountjoy Forest.\n\nIn compliance with the request of Lord Blessington, I studied\nShakspeare with this amiable and gifted woman for many months, which\ncemented a friendship between us that ended but with her life. Her\nmethod of reading was admirable; for to the grandeur of her sister Mrs.\nSiddons, she united a tenderness and softness, in which that great\nactress was said to be deficient. I never open any of the plays of\nShakspeare which I studied with her without thinking I hear her voice,\nand I like them better for the association.\n\nTo great personal attractions, which even to the last she retained\nenough of to give a notion of what her beauty must have been in her\nyouth, Mrs. T---- added a charm of manners, a cultivation of mind, and\na goodness of heart seldom surpassed; and, in all the relations of\nlife, her conduct was most praiseworthy. Even now, though six years\nhave elapsed since her death, the recollection of it brings tears to my\neyes. Good and gentle woman, may your virtues on earth find their\nreward in Heaven!\n\nI passed last evening at Madame Craufurd's, where I met Lady Charlotte\nLindsay and the Misses Berry. How perfectly they answered to the\ndescription given of them by Sir William Gell; who, though exceedingly\nattached to all three, has not, as far as one interview permitted me to\njudge, overrated their agreeability! Sir William Gell has read me many\nletters from these ladies, replete with talent, of which their\nconversation reminded me.\n\nFrancis Hare and his wife dined here to-day. They are _en route_ from\nGermany--where they have been sojourning since their marriage--for\nEngland, where her _accouchement_ is to take place. Francis Hare has\nlived with us so much in Italy, that we almost consider him a member of\nthe domestic circle; and, on the faith of this, he expressed his desire\nthat we should receive _madame son épouse_ as if she were an old\nacquaintance.\n\nMrs. Hare is well-looking, and agreeable, appears amiable, and is a\ngood musician. I remember seeing her and her sisters with her mother,\nLady Paul, at Florence, when I had little notion that she was to be\nMrs. Hare. I never meet Francis Hare without being surprised by the\nversatility of his information; it extends to the fine arts,\nliterature, rare books, the localities of pictures and statues; in\nshort, he is a moving library that may always be consulted with profit,\nand his memory is as accurate as an index in rendering its precious\nstores available.\n\nIt is strange, that the prominent taste of his wife, which is for\nmusic, is the only one denied to him. He afforded an amusing instance\nof this fact last night, when Mrs. Hare, having performed several airs\non the piano-forte, he asked her, \"Why she played the same tune so\noften, for the monotony was tiresome?\"--an observation that set us all\nlaughing.\n\nTook Mrs. Hare out shopping--saw piles of lace, heaps of silk, pyramids\nof riband, and all other female gear. What a multiplicity of pretty\nthings we women require to render us what we consider presentable! And\nhow few of us, however good-looking we may chance to be, would agree\nwith the poet, that \"loveliness needs not the foreign aid of ornament,\nbut is, when unadorned, adorned the most.\"\n\nEven the fairest of the sex like to enhance the charms of nature by the\naid of dress; and the plainest hope to become less so by its\nassistance. Men are never sufficiently sensible of our humility, in\nconsidering it so necessary to increase our attractions in order to\nplease them, nor grateful enough for the pains we bestow in the\nattempts.\n\nHusbands and fathers are particularly insensible to this amiable desire\non the parts of their wives and daughters; and, when asked to pay the\nheavy bills incurred in consequence of this praiseworthy humility and\ndesire to please, evince any feeling rather than that of satisfaction.\n\nIt is only admirers not called on to pay these said bills who duly\nappreciate the cause and effect, and who can hear of women passing\nwhole hours in tempting shops, without that elongation of countenance\npeculiar to husbands and fathers.\n\nI could not help thinking with the philosopher, how many things I saw\nto-day that could be done without. If women could be made to understand\nthat costliness of attire seldom adds to beauty, and often deteriorates\nit, a great amelioration in expense could be accomplished.\n\nTransparent muslin, the cheapest of all materials, is one of the\nprettiest, too, for summer's wear, and with the addition of some bows\nof delicate-coloured riband, or a _bouquet_ of fresh flowers, forms a\nmost becoming dress. The lowness of the price of such a robe enables\nthe purchaser to have so frequent a change of it, that even those who\nare far from rich may have half-a-dozen, while one single robe of a\nmore expensive material will cost more; and having done so, the owner\nwill think it right to wear it more frequently than is consistent with\nthe freshness and purity that should ever be the distinguishing\ncharacteristics in female dress, in order to indemnify herself for the\nexpense.\n\nI was never more struck with this fact, than a short time ago, when I\nsaw two ladies seated next each other, both young and handsome; but\none, owing to the freshness of her robe, which was of simple\n_organdie_, looked infinitely better than the other, who was quite as\npretty, but who, wearing a robe of expensive lace, whose whiteness had\nfallen into \"the sere and yellow leaf,\" appeared faded and _passée_.\n\nBe wise, then, ye young and fair; and if, as I suspect, your object be\nto please the Lords of the Creation, let your dress, in summer, be\nsnowy-white muslin, never worn after its pristine purity becomes\nproblematical; and in winter, let some half-dozen plain and simple silk\ngowns be purchased, instead of the two or three expensive ones that\ngenerally form the wardrobe, and which, consequently, soon not only\nlose their lustre but give the wearer the appearance of having suffered\nthe same fate!\n\nAnd you, O husbands and fathers, present and future, be ye duly\nimpressed with a sense of your manifold obligations to me for thus\nopening the eyes of your wives and daughters how to please without\ndraining your purses; and when the maledictions of lace, velvet, and\nsatin-sellers full on my hapless head, for counsel so injurious to\ntheir interests, remember they were incurred for yours!\n\nMr. and Mrs. Hare dined here yesterday. They brought with them Madame\nde la H----, who came up from near Chantilly to see them. She is as\npretty as I remember her at Florence, when Mademoiselle D----, and is\n_piquante_ and _spirituelle_. Counts Charles de Mornay and Valeski\nformed the party, and Count Maussion and some others came in the\nevening.\n\nI observe that few English shine in conversation with the French. There\nis a lightness and brilliancy, a sort of touch and go, if I may say so,\nin the latter, seldom, if ever, to be acquired by strangers. Never\ndwelling long on any subject, and rarely entering profoundly into it,\nthey sparkle on the surface with great dexterity, bringing wit, gaiety,\nand tact, into play.\n\nLike summer lightning, French wit flashes frequently, brightly and\ninnocuously, leaving nothing disagreeable to remind one of its having\nappeared. Conversation is, with the French, the aim and object of\nsociety. All enter it prepared to take a part, and he best enacts it\nwho displays just enough knowledge to show that much remains behind.\nSuch is the tact of the Parisians, that even the ignorant conceal the\npoverty of their minds, and might, to casual observers, pass as being\nin no way deficient, owing to the address with which they glide in an\n_à propos oui, ou non_, and an appropriate shake of the head, nod of\nassent, or dissent.\n\nThe constitutional vivacity of the French depending much on their\nmercurial temperaments, greatly aids them in conversation. A light and\nplayful sally acquires additional merit when uttered with gaiety; and\nshould a _bon mot_ even contain something calculated to pique any one\npresent, or reflect on the absent, the mode in which it is uttered\ntakes off from the force of the matter; whereas, on the contrary, the\nmore grave and sententious manner peculiar to the English adds pungency\nto their satire. Our old and valued friend, Mr. J. Strangways, has\narrived at Paris, and very glad were we to see him once more. He passed\nthrough a severe trial since last we parted; and his conduct under it\ntowards his poor friend, Mr. Anson, does him credit.\n\nThe two companions--one the brother of the Earl of Ilchester, and the\nother of Lord Anson--were travelling in Syria together. They had passed\nthrough Aleppo, where the plague had then appeared, and were at the\ndistance of several days' journey from it, congratulating themselves on\ntheir safety, when, owing to some error on the part of those who\nexamined their firman, they were compelled to retrace their steps to\nAleppo, where, condemned to become the inhabitants of a lazaretto until\nthe imagined mistake could be corrected, they found themselves\n_tête-à-tête_.\n\nThe first two or three days passed without any thing to alarm the\nfriends. Engaged in drawing maps for their intended route, and plans\nfor the future, the hours glided away even cheerfully.\n\nBut this cheerfulness was not long to continue; for Mr. Anson, having\none morning asked Mr. Strangways to hold the end of his shawl while he\ntwisted it round his head as a turban, the latter observed, with a\ndegree of horror and dismay more easily to be imagined than described,\nthe fatal plague-spot clearly defined on the back of the neck of his\nunfortunate friend.\n\nHe concealed his emotion, well knowing that a suspicion of its cause\nwould add to the danger of Mr. Anson, who, as yet, was unconscious of\nthe fearful malady that had already assailed him. Totally alone,\nwithout aid, save that contained in their own very limited resources,\nwhat must have been the feelings of Mr. Strangways, as he contemplated\nhis luckless companion?\n\nHe dreaded to hear the announcement of physical suffering, though he\nwell knew it must soon come, and marked with indescribable anguish the\nchange that rapidly began to be manifested in his friend. But even this\nmost terrible of all maladies was influenced by the gallant spirit of\nhim on whom it was now preying; for not a complaint, not a murmur,\nbroke from his lips: and it was not until Mr. Strangways had repeatedly\nurged the most affectionate inquiries that he admitted he was not quite\nwell.\n\nDelirium quickly followed; but even then this noble-minded young man\nbore up against the fearful assaults of disease, and thought and spoke\nonly of those dear and absent friends he was doomed never again to\nbehold. It was a dreadful trial to Mr. Strangways to sit by the bed of\ndeath, far, far away from home and friends, endeavouring to cool the\nburning brow and to refresh the parched lips of him so fondly loved in\nthat distant land of which he raved.\n\nHe spoke of his home, of those who made it so dear to him, and even the\nsongs of infancy were again murmured by the dying lips. His friend\nquitted him not for a minute until all was over; and _he_ was left\nindeed alone to watch, over the corpse of him whom he had tried in vain\nto save.\n\nThat Mr. Strangways should have escaped the contagion, seems little\nless than miraculous. I, who have known him so long and so well,\nattribute it to the state of his mind, which was so wholly occupied by\nanxiety for his friend as to leave no room for any thought of self.\n\nMade no entry in my journal for two days, owing to a slight\nindisposition, which furnished an excuse for laziness.\n\nDined at Lointier's yesterday--a splendid repast given by Count A. de\nMaussion, in consequence of a wager, lost on a subject connected with\nthe line arts. The party consisted of all those present at our house\nwhen the wager was made. The Duc and Duchesse de Guiche, Mr. and Mrs.\nFrancis Hare, the Duc de Talleyrand, Duc de Dino, Count Valeski, Mr. J.\nStrangways, and our own large family circle.\n\nThe dinner was the most _recherché_ that could be furnished: \"all the\ndelicacies of the season,\" as a London paper would term it, were\nprovided; and an epicure, however fastidious, would have been satisfied\nwith the choice and variety of the _plats_; while a _gourmand_ would\nhave luxuriated in the quantity.\n\nNothing in the style of the apartments, or the service of the dinner,\nbore the least indication that we were in the house of a _restaurant_.\n\nA large and richly furnished _salon_, well lighted, received the\ncompany before dinner; and in a _salle à manger_ of equal dimensions,\nand equally well arranged, the dinner was served on a very fine service\nof old plate.\n\nCount de Maussion did the honours of the dinner _à merveille_, and it\npassed off very gaily. It had been previously agreed that the whole\nparty were to adjourn to the Porte St. Martin, at which Count de\nMaussion had engaged three large private boxes; and the ladies,\nconsequently, with one exception, came _en demi-toilette_.\n\nThe exception was Mrs. Hare, who, not aware that at Paris people never\ngo _en grande toilette_ to the theatres, came so smartly dressed, that,\nseeing our simple toilettes, she was afraid of incurring observation if\nshe presented herself in a rich dress with short sleeves, a gold tissue\nturban with a bird-of-paradise plume, and an _aigrette_ of coloured\nstones; so she went to our house, with a few of the party, while I\naccompanied the rest to the theatre.\n\nThe piece was _Faust_, adapted from Goethe, and was admirably\nperformed, more especially the parts of \"Mephistopheles\" and\n\"Margaret,\" in which Madame Dorval acts inimitably. This actress has\ngreat merit; and the earnestness of her manner, and the touching tones\nof her voice, give a great air of truth to her performances. The\nprison-scene was powerfully acted; and the madness of \"Margaret\" when\nstretched on her bed of straw, resisting the vain efforts of her lover\nto rescue her, had a fearful reality.\n\nThe character of \"Margaret\" is a fine conception, and Goethe has\nwrought it out beautifully. The simplicity, gentleness, and warm\nfeelings of the village maiden, excite a strong interest for her, even\nwhen worked upon by Vanity; that alloy which, alas for Woman's virtue\nand happiness! is too frequently found mixed up in the pure ore of her\nnature.\n\nThe childish delight with which poor \"Margaret\" contemplates the\ntrinkets presented by her lover; the baleful ascendency acquired over\nher by her female companion; and her rapid descent in the path of evil\nwhen, as is ever the case, the commission of one sin entails so many,\nrender this drama a very effective moral lesson.\n\nOf all Goethe's works, _Faust_ is the one I most like; and, of all his\nfemale characters, \"Margaret\" is that which I prefer. A fine vein of\nphilosophy runs through the whole of this production, in which the\nvanity of human knowledge without goodness was never more powerfully\nexemplified.\n\n\"Faust,\" tempted by the desire of acquiring forbidden knowledge, yields\nup his soul to the evil one; yet still retains enough of the humanity\nof his nature to render him wretched, when her he loves, and has drawn\nruin on, suffers the penalty of his crime and of her love.\n\nExquisitely has Goethe wrought out the effects of the all-engrossing\npassion of the poor \"Margaret\"--a passion that even in madness, still\nclings to its object with all woman's tenderness and devotion,\ninvesting even insanity with the touching charm of love. How perfect is\nthe part when, endeavouring to pray, the hapless \"Margaret\" fancies\nthat she hears the gibbering of evil spirits interrupting her\nsupplications, so that even the consolation of addressing the Divinity\nis denied her!\n\nBut the last scene--that in the prison--is the most powerful of all.\nNever was madness more touchingly delineated, or woman's nature more\ntruly developed;--that nature so little understood by those who are so\nprone to pervert it, and whose triumphs over its virtues are always\nachieved by means of the excess of that propensity to love, and to\nbelieve in the truth of the object beloved, which is one of the most\nbeautiful characteristics in woman; though, wo to her! it is but too\noften used to her undoing.\n\nThe feelings of poor \"Margaret\" are those of all her sex, ere vice has\nsullied the nature it never can wholly subdue.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Hare left Paris to-day. I regret their departure; for she\nis lively and agreeable, and I have known him so long, and like him so\nwell, that their society afforded me pleasure.\n\nA large party at dinner, yesterday; among whom, was Mr. M----, who has\nacquired a certain celebrity for his _bons mots_. He is said to be\ndecidedly clever, and to know the world thoroughly: appreciating it at\nits just value, and using it as if formed for his peculiar profit and\npleasure. He is lately returned from England, where he has been\nreceived with that hospitality that characterises the English, and has\ngone a round of visits to many of the best houses.\n\nHe spoke in high terms of the hospitality he had experienced, but\nagreed in the opinion I have often heard Lord Byron give, that the\nsociety in English country-houses is any thing but agreeable.\n\nI had heard so much of Mr. M----, that I listened to his conversation\nwith more interest than I might have done, had not so many reports of\nhis shrewdness and wit reached me. Neither seem to have been overrated;\nfor nothing escapes his quick perception; and his caustic wit is\nunsparingly and fearlessly applied to all subjects and persons that\nexcite it into action.\n\nHe appears to be a privileged person--an anomaly seldom innoxiously\npermitted in society: for those who may say _all they_ please, rarely\nabstain from saying much that may displease others; and, though a laugh\nmay he often excited by their wit, some one of the circle is sure to be\nwounded by it.\n\nGreat wit is not often allied to good-nature, for the indulgence of the\nfirst is destructive to the existence of the second, except where the\nwit is tempered by a more than ordinary share of sensibility and\nrefinement, directing its exercise towards works of imagination,\ninstead of playing it off, as is too frequently the case, against those\nwith whom its owner may come in contact.\n\nByron, had he not been a poet, would have become a wit in society; and,\ninstead of delighting his readers, would have wounded his associates.\nLuckily for others, as well as for his own fame, he devoted to\nliterature that ready and brilliant wit which sparkles in so many of\nhis pages, instead of condescending to expend it in _bons mots_, or\n_réparties_, that might have set the table on a roar, and have been\nafterwards, as often occurs, mutilated in being repeated by, others.\n\nThe quickness of apprehension peculiar to the French, joined to the\nexcessive _amour propre_, which is one of the most striking of their\ncharacteristics, render them exceedingly susceptible to the arrows of\nwit; which, when barbed by ridicule, inflict wounds on their vanity\ndifficult to be healed, and which they are ever ready to avenge.\n\nBut this very acuteness of apprehension induces a caution in not\nresenting the assaults of wit, unless the wounded can retort with\nsuccess by a similar weapon, or that the attack has been so obvious\nthat he is justified in resenting it by a less poetical one. Hence\narises a difficult position for him on whom a wit is pleased to\nexercise his talent; and this is one of the many reasons why privileged\npersons seldom add much to the harmony of society.\n\nWent last night to the Porte St. Martin, and saw _Sept Heures_\nrepresented. This piece has excited a considerable sensation at Paris;\nand the part of the heroine, \"Charlotte Corday,\" being enacted by\nMadame Dorval, a very clever actress, it is very popular.\n\n\"Charlotte Corday\" is represented in the piece, not as a heroine\nactuated purely by patriotic motives in seeking the destruction of a\ntyrant who inflicted such wounds on her country, but by the less\nsublime one of avenging the death of her lover. This, in my opinion,\nlessens the interest of the drama, and atones not for the horror always\ninspired by a woman's arming herself for a scene of blood.\n\nThe taste of the Parisians has, I think, greatly degenerated, both in\ntheir light literature and their dramas. The desire for excitement, and\nnot a decrease of talent, is the cause; and this morbid craving for it\nwill, I fear, lead to injurious consequences, not only in literature,\nbut in other and graver things.\n\nThe schoolmaster is, indeed, abroad in France, and has in all parts of\nit found apt scholars--perhaps, too apt; and, like all such, the\ndigestion of what is acquired does not equal the appetite for\nacquisition: consequently, the knowledge gained is as yet somewhat\ncrude and unavailable. Nevertheless, the people are making rapid\nstrides in improvement; and ignorance will soon be more rare than\nknowledge formerly was.\n\nAt present, their minds are somewhat unsettled by the recentness of\ntheir progress; and in the exuberance consequent on such a state, some\ndanger is to be apprehended.\n\nLike a room from which light has been long excluded, and in which a\nlarge window is opened, all the disagreeable objects in it so long\nshrouded in darkness are so fully revealed, that the owner, becoming\nimpatient to remove them and substitute others in their place, often\ndoes so at the expense of appropriateness, and crowds the chamber with\na heterogeneous _mélange_ of furniture, which, however useful in\nseparate parts, are too incongruous to produce a good effect. So the\nminds of the French people are now too enlightened any longer to suffer\nthe prejudices that formerly filled them to remain, and have, in their\nimpatience, stored them with new ideas and opinions--many of them good\nand useful, but too hastily adopted, and not in harmony with each other\nto be productive of a good result, until time has enabled their owners\nto class and arrange them.\n\nI am every day more forcibly struck with the natural quickness and\nintelligence of the people here: but this very quickness is a cause\nthat may tend to retard their progress in knowledge, by inducing them\nto jump at conclusions, instead of marching slowly but steadily to\nthem; and conclusions so rapidly made are apt to be as hastily acted\nupon, and, consequently, occasion errors that take some time to be\ndiscovered, and still more to be corrected, before the truth is\nattained.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\nMade the acquaintance of the celebrated Dr. P----, today, at Madame\nC----'s. He is a very interesting old man; and, though infirm in body,\nhis mind is as fresh, and his vivacity as unimpaired, as if he had not\nnumbered forty instead of eighty summers.\n\nI am partial to the society of clever medical men, for the\nopportunities afforded them of becoming acquainted with human nature,\nby studying it under all the phases of illness, convalescence, and on\nthe bed of death, when the real character is exposed unveiled from the\nmotives that so often shadow, if not give it a false character, in the\ndays of health, render their conversation very interesting.\n\nI have observed, too, that the knowledge of human nature thus attained\nneither hardens the heart nor blunts the sensibility, for some of the\nmost kind-natured men I ever knew were also the most skilful physicians\nand admirable, surgeons. Among these is Mr. Guthrie, of London, whose\nrare dexterity in his art I have often thought may be in a great degree\nattributed to this very kindness of nature, which has induced him to\nbestow a more than usual attention to acquiring it, in order to abridge\nthe sufferings of his patients.\n\nIn operations on the eye, in which he has gained such a justly merited\ncelebrity, I have been told by those from whose eyes he had removed\ncataracts, that his precision and celerity are so extraordinary as to\nappear to them little short of miraculous.\n\nTalking on this subject with Dr. P---- to-day, he observed, that he\nconsidered strength of mind and kindness of heart indispensable\nrequisites to form a surgeon; and that it was a mistake to suppose that\nthese qualities had any other than a salutary influence over the nerves\nof a surgeon.\n\n\"It braces them, Madame,\" said he; \"for pity towards the patient\ninduces an operator to perform his difficult task _con amore_, in order\nto relieve him.\"\n\nDr. P---- has nearly lost his voice, and speaks in a low but distinct\nwhisper. Tall and thin, with a face pale as marble, but full of\nintelligence, he looks, when bending on his gold-headed cane, the very\n_beau idéal_ of a physician of _la Vieille Cour_, and he still retains\nthe costume of that epoch. His manner, half jest and half earnest,\ngives an idea of what that of the Philosopher of Ferney must have been\nwhen in a good humour, and adds piquancy to his narrations. Madame\nC----, who is an especial favourite of his, and who can draw him out in\nconversation better than any one else, in paying him a delicate and\nwell-timed compliment on his celebrity, added, that few had ever so\nwell merited it.\n\n\"Ah! Madame, celebrity is not always accorded to real merit,\" said he,\nsmiling. \"I have before told Madame that mine--if I may be permitted to\nrecur to it--was gained by an artifice I had recourse to, and without\nwhich, I firmly believe I should have remained unknown.\"\n\n\"No, no! my dear doctor,\" replied Madame C----; \"your merit must have,\nin time, acquired you the great fame you enjoy.\" The Doctor laughed\nheartily, but persisted in denying this; and the lady urged him to\nrelate to me the plan he had so successfully pursued in abridging his\nroad to Fortune. He seemed flattered by her request, and by my desire\nfor his compliance with it, and commenced as follows:--\n\n     \"I came from the country, Mesdames, with no inconsiderable\n     claims to distinction in my profession. I had studied it _con\n     amore_, and, urged by the desire that continually haunted me\n     of becoming a benefactor to mankind--ay! ladies, and still\n     more anxious to relieve your fair and gentle sex from those\n     ills to which the delicacy of your frames and the sensibility\n     of your minds so peculiarly expose you--I came to Paris with\n     little money and few friends, and those few possessed no\n     power to forward my interest.\n\n     \"It is true they recommended me to such of their acquaintance\n     as needed advice; but whether, owing to the season being a\n     peculiarly healthy one, or that the acquaintances of my\n     friends enjoyed an unusual portion of good health, I was\n     seldom called on to attend them; and, when I was, the\n     remuneration offered was proportioned, not to the relief\n     afforded, but to the want of fame of him who lent it.\n\n     \"My purse diminished even more rapidly than my hopes, though\n     they, too, began to fade; and it was with a heavy heart that\n     I look my pen to write home to those dear friends who\n     believed that Paris was a second _El Dorado_, where all who\n     sought--must find--Fortune.\n\n     \"At length, when one night stretched on my humble bed, and\n     sleepless from the cares that pressed heavily on my mind, it\n     occurred to me that I must put some plan into action for\n     getting myself known; and one suggested itself, which I next\n     day adopted.\n\n     \"I changed one of the few remaining _louis d'or_ in my purse,\n     and, sallying forth into one of the most popular streets, I\n     wrote down the addresses of some of the most\n     respectable-looking houses, and going up to a porter, desired\n     him to knock at the doors named, and inquire if the\n     celebrated Doctor P---- was there, as his presence was\n     immediately required at the hôtel of the Duc de ----.\n\n     \"I despatched no less than twenty messengers through the\n     different streets on the same errand, and having succeeded in\n     persuading each that it was of the utmost importance that the\n     celebrated Doctor P---- should be found, they persuaded the\n     owners of the houses of the same necessity.\n\n     \"I persevered in this system for a few days, and then tried\n     its efficacy at night, thinking that, when knocked up from\n     their beds, people would be sure to be more impressed with\n     the importance of a doctor in such general request.\n\n     \"My scheme succeeded. In a few days, I was repeatedly called\n     in by various patients, and liberal fees poured into the\n     purse of the celebrated Dr. P----. Unfortunately my practice,\n     although every day multiplying even beyond my most sanguine\n     hopes, was entirely confined to the _bourgeoisie_; and though\n     they paid well, my ambition pointed to higher game, and I\n     longed to feel the pulses of _la haute noblesse_, and to\n     ascertain if the fine porcelain of which I had heard they\n     were formed was indeed as much superior to the delf of which\n     the _bourgeoisie_ are said to be manufactured, as I was led\n     to believe.\n\n     \"Luckily for me, the _femme de chambre_ of a grand lady\n     fancied herself ill, mentioned the fancy to her friend, who\n     was one of my patients, and who instantly advised her to\n     consult the _celebrated_ Dr. P----, adding a lively account\n     of the extent of my practice and the great request I was in.\n\n     \"The _femme de chambre_ consulted me, described symptoms\n     enough to baffle all the schools of medicine in France, so\n     various and contradictory were they, and I, discovering that\n     she really had nothing the matter with her, advised what I\n     knew would be very palatable to her,--namely, a very\n     nutritious _régime_, as much air and amusement as was\n     possible in her position, and gave her a prescription for\n     some gentle medicine, to prevent any evil effect from the\n     luxurious fare I had recommended.\n\n     \"I was half tempted to refuse the fee she slipped into my\n     hand, but I recollected that people never value what they get\n     for nothing, and so I pocketed it.\n\n     \"In a few days, I was sent for to the Hôtel--to attend the\n     Duchesse de ---- the mistress of the said _femme de chambre_.\n     This was an event beyond my hopes, and I determined to profit\n     by it. I found the Duchesse suffering under a malady--if\n     malady it could be called--to which I have since discovered\n     grand ladies are peculiarly subject; namely, a superfluity of\n     _embonpoint_, occasioned by luxurious habits and the want of\n     exercise.\n\n     \"'I am very much indisposed, Doctor,' lisped the lady, 'and\n     your prescription has done my _femme de chambre_ so much\n     good, that I determined to send for you. I am so very ill,\n     that I am fast losing my shape; my face, too, is no longer\n     the same; and my feet and hands are not to be recognised.'\n\n     \"I drew out my watch, felt her pulse, looked grave,\n     inquired--though it was useless, her _embonpoint_ having\n     revealed it--what were her general habits and _régime_; and\n     then, having written a prescription, urged the necessity of\n     her abandoning _café au lait_, rich _consommés_, and\n     high-seasoned _entrées_; recommended early rising and\n     constant exercise; and promised that a strict attention to my\n     advice would soon restore her health, and with it her shape.\n\n     \"I was told to call every day until further orders; and I,\n     pleading the excess of occupation which would render my daily\n     visits to her so difficult, consented to make them, only on\n     condition that my fair patient was to walk with me every day\n     six times around the garden of her hôtel; for I guessed she\n     was too indolent to persevere in taking exercise if left to\n     herself.\n\n     \"The system I pursued with her succeeded perfectly. I was\n     then a very active man, and I walked so fast that I left the\n     Duchesse every day when our promenade ended bathed in a\n     copious perspiration; which, aided by the medicine and\n     sparing _régime_, soon restored her figure to its former\n     symmetry.\n\n     \"At her hôtel, I daily met ladies of the highest rank and\n     distinction, many of whom were suffering from a similar\n     cause, the same annoyance for which the Duchesse consulted\n     me; and I then discovered that there is no malady, however\n     grave, so distressing to your sex, ladies, or for the cure of\n     which they are so willing to submit to the most disagreeable\n     _régime_, as for aught that impairs their personal beauty.\n\n     \"When her female friends saw the improvement effected in the\n     appearance of the Duchesse by my treatment, I was consulted\n     by them all, and my fame and fortune rapidly increased. I was\n     proclaimed to be the most wonderful physician, and to have\n     effected the most extraordinary cures; when, in truth, I but\n     consulted Nature, and aided her efforts.\n\n     \"Shortly after this period, a grand lady, an acquaintance of\n     one of my many patients among the _noblesse_, consulted me;\n     and here the case was wholly different to that of the\n     Duchesse, for this lady had grown so thin, that\n     wrinkles--those most frightful of all symptoms of decaying\n     beauty--had made their appearance. My new patient told me\n     that, hearing that hitherto my great celebrity had been\n     acquired by the cure of obesity, she feared it was useless to\n     consult me for a disease of so opposite a nature, but even\n     still more distressing.\n\n     \"I inquired into her habits and _régime_. Found that she took\n     violent exercise; was abstemious at table; drank strong green\n     tea, and coffee without cream or milk; disliked nutritious\n     food; and, though she sat up late, was an early riser. I\n     ordered her the frequent use of warm baths, and to take all\n     that I had prohibited the Duchesse; permitted only gentle\n     exercise in a carriage; and, in short, soon succeeded in\n     rendering the thin lady plump and rosy, to the great joy of\n     herself, and the wonder of her friends.\n\n     \"This treatment, which was only what any one possessed of\n     common sense would have prescribed in such a case, extended\n     my fame far and wide. Fat and thin ladies flocked to me for\n     advice, and not only liberally rewarded the success of my\n     system, but sounded my praises in all quarters.\n\n     \"I became the doctor _à la mode_, soon amassed an\n     independence, and, though not without a confidence in my own\n     skill--for I have never lost any opportunity of improvement\n     in my profession--I must confess that I still retain the\n     conviction that the celebrated Doctor P---- would have had\n     little chance, at least for many years, of acquiring either\n     fame or wealth, had he not employed the means I have\n     confessed to you, ladies.\"\n\nI cannot do justice to this _spirituel_ old man's mode of telling the\nstory, or describe the finesse of his arch smile while recounting it.\n\nMr. P.C. Scarlett, a son of our excellent and valued friend Sir James\nScarlett[3], dined here yesterday. He is a fine young man, clever,\nwell-informed, and amiable, with the same benignant countenance and\nurbanity of manner that are so remarkable in his father.\n\nI remember how much struck I was with Sir James Scarlett's countenance\nwhen he was first presented to me. It has in it such a happy mixture of\nsparkling intelligence and good-nature that I was immediately pleased\nwith him, even before I had an opportunity of knowing the rare and\nexcellent qualities for which he is distinguished, and the treasures of\nknowledge with which his mind is stored.\n\nI have seldom met any man so well versed in literature as Sir James\nScarlett, or with a more refined taste for it; and when one reflects on\nthe arduous duties of his profession--duties which he has ever\nfulfilled with such credit to himself and advantage to others--it seems\nlittle short of miraculous how he could have found time to have made\nhimself so intimately acquainted, not only with the classics, but with\nall the elegant literature of England and France.\n\nHow many pleasant days have I passed in the society of Lord Erskine and\nSir James Scarlett! Poor Lord Erskine! never more shall I hear your\neloquent tongue utter _bons mots_ in which wit sparkled, but ill-nature\nnever appeared; nor see your luminous eyes flashing with joyousness, as\nwhen, surrounded by friends at the festive board, you rendered the\nbanquet indeed \"the feast of reason and the flow of soul!\"\n\nMr. H---- B---- dined here yesterday, and he talked over the pleasant\ndays we had passed in Italy. He is an excellent specimen of the young\nmen of the present day. Well-informed, and with a mind highly\ncultivated, he has travelled much in other countries, without losing\nany of the good qualities and habits peculiar to his own.\n\nWent to the Théàtre Italien, last night, and heard Madame Malibran sing\nfor the first time. Her personation of \"Desdemona\" is exquisite, and\nthe thrilling tones of her voice were in perfect harmony with the deep\nsensibility she evinced in every look and movement.\n\nI have heard no singer to please me comparable to Malibran: there is\nsomething positively electrical in the effect she produces on my\nfeelings. Her acting is as original as it is effective; Passion and\nNature are her guides, and she abandons herself to them _con amore_.\n\nThe only defect I can discover in her singing is an excess of\n_fiorituri_, that sometimes destroys the _vraisemblance_ of the _rôle_\nshe is enacting, and makes one think more of the wonderful singer than\nof \"Desdemona.\" This defect, however, is atoned for by the bursts of\npassion into which her powerful voice breaks when some deep emotion is\nto be expressed, and the accomplished singer is forgotten in the\nimpassioned \"Desdemona.\"\n\nSpent last evening at Madame C----'s, and met there la Duchcsse de la\nForce, la Marquise de Bréhan, and the usual _habitués de la maison_. La\nDuchesse is one of _l'ancien régime_, though less ceremonious than they\nare in general said to be, and appears to be as good-natured as she is\ngood-humoured.\n\nThe Marquise de B---- told me some amusing anecdotes of the Imperial\nCourt, and of the gaiety and love of dress of the beautiful Princesse\nPauline Borghese, to whom she was much attached.\n\nThe whole of the Buonaparte family seem to have possessed, in an\neminent degree, the happy art of conciliating good-will in those around\nthem--an art necessary in all persons filling elevated positions, but\ndoubly so in those who have achieved their own elevation. The family of\nthe Emperor Napoleon were remarkable for the kindness and consideration\nthey invariably evinced for those who in any way depended on them, yet\na natural dignity of manner precluded the possibility of familiarity.\n\nThe Marquise de B---- having mentioned the Duchesse d'Abrantes, Madame\nC---- inquired kindly for her, and the Marquise told her that she had\nbeen only a few days before to pay her a visit.\n\nAnxious to learn something of a woman who filled so distinguished a\nposition during the imperial dynasty, I questioned Madame de B----, and\nlearned that the Duchesse d'Abrantes, who for many years lived in a\nstyle of splendour that, even in the palmy days of her husband's\nprosperity, when, governor of Paris, he supported almost a regal\nestablishment, excited the surprise, if not envy, of his\ncontemporaries, is now reduced to so limited an income that many of the\ncomforts, if not the necessaries of life, are denied her.\n\n\"She supports her privations cheerfully,\" added the Marquise; \"her\nconversation abounds in anecdotes of remarkable people, and she relates\nthem with a vivacity and piquancy peculiar to her, which render her\nsociety very amusing and interesting. The humanity, if not the policy,\nof the Bourbons may be questioned in their leaving the widow of a brave\ngeneral in a state of poverty that must remind her, with bitterness, of\nthe altered fortunes entailed on her and many others by their\nrestoration.\"\n\nWhen indemnities were granted to those whom the Revolution, which drove\nthe royal family from France, nearly beggared, it would have been well\nif a modest competency had been assigned to those whose sons and\nhusbands shed their blood for their country, and helped to achieve for\nit that military glory which none can deny it.\n\nWent over the Luxembourg Palace and Gardens to-day. The only change in\nthe former since I last saw it, is that some pictures, painted by\nFrench artists at Rome, and very creditable to them, have been added to\nits collection.\n\nI like these old gardens, with their formal walks and prim _parterres_;\nI like also the company by which they are chiefly frequented,\nconsisting of old people and young children.\n\nAlong the walk exposed to the southern aspect, several groups of old\nmen were sauntering, conversing with an animation seldom seen in\nsexagenarians, except in France; old women, too, many of them holding\nlapdogs by a riband, and attended by a female servant, were taking\ntheir daily walk; while, occasionally, might be seen an elderly couple\nexhibiting towards each other an assiduity pleasant to behold,\ndisplayed by the husband's arranging the shawl or cloak of his wife, or\nthe wife gently brushing away with her glove the silken threads left on\nhis sleeve by its contact with hers.\n\nNo little portion of the love that united them in youth may still be\nwitnessed in these old couples. Each has lost every trace of the\ncomeliness that first attracted them to each other; but they remember\nwhat they were, and memory, gilding the past, shews each to the other,\nnot as they actually are, but as they were many a long year ago. No\nface, however fair,--not even the blooming one of their favourite\ngranddaughter, seems so lovely to the uxorious old husband as the one\nhe remembers to have been so proud of forty years ago, and which still\nbeams on him with an expression of tenderness that reminds him of its\nformer beauty. And she, too, with what complacency does she listen to\nhis oft-repealed reminiscences of her youthful attractions, and how\ndear is the bond that still unites them!\n\nPlain and uninteresting in the eyes of others, they present only the\naspect of age; alas! never lovely: but in them at least other gleams of\npast good looks recall the past, when each considered the other\npeerless, though now they alone remember that \"such things were, and\nwere most sweet.\"\n\nTheir youth and their maturity have been passed together; their joys\nand their sorrows have been shared, and they are advancing hand in hand\ntowards that rapid descent in the mountain of life, at whose base is\nthe grave, hoping that in death they may not be divided.\n\nWho can look at those old couples, and not feel impressed with the\nsanctity and blessedness of marriage, which, binding two destinies in\none, giving the same interests and the same objects of affection to\nboth, secures for each a companionship and a consolation for those days\nwhich must come to all, when, fallen into the sere and yellow leaf, the\nsociety of the young and gay can no longer charm them, and the present\nrequires the recollections of the past to render it less cheerless;\nrecollections only to be found in those who have grown old together?\n\nYonder old man, leaning on the arm of a middle-aged woman, who seems\nless like his housekeeper than his domestic tyrant, offers an example\nof the fate of those who have lived in what is commonly called a state\nof single blessedness. A youth and maturity of pleasure have been\nfollowed by an old age of infirmity.\n\nHe had a thousand pleasantries ready to utter on the subject of\nmarriage whenever it was mentioned; could cite endless examples of\nunhappy couples (forgetting to name a single one of the happy); and\nlaughed and shook his head as he declared that _he_ never would be\ncaught.\n\nAs long as health remained, and that he could pass his evenings in gay\nsociety, or at the theatres, he felt not the want of that greatest of\nall comforts, _home_; a comfort inseparable from a wife to share, as\nwell as to make it. But the first attack of illness that confined him\nto his room, with no tender hand to smooth his pillow, no gentle voice\nto inquire into his wants, or to minister to them; no one to anticipate\nhis wishes almost before he had framed them; no loving face to look\nfondly and anxiously on him; made him feel sensible, that though a\nbachelor's life of pleasure may pass agreeably enough during the season\nof health, it is a most cheerless and dreary state of existence when\ndeprived of it.\n\nThe discovery is, alas! made too late. All that he had ever heard or\nurged against matrimony applies tenfold to cases where it is contracted\nin old age. He can still admire youth and beauty, but he knows that\nwith such there can never exist any reciprocity with his own feelings.\n\nThe young beauty who would barter her charms for his wealth, would be,\nhe knows, no suitable companion for his fire-side; and to wed some\nstaid dame whose youth has been passed with some dear, kind, first\nhusband--of whom, if not often speaking, she might in all human\nprobability be sometimes thinking--has something too repugnant to his\nfeelings to be thought of.\n\nAn elderly maiden with a lap-dog, or a parrot, would be even more\ninsupportable; for how could one who has never had to consult the\npleasure or wishes of aught save self be able to study his? No! it is\nnow too late to think of marriage, and what, therefore, is to be done?\nIn this emergency, a severe attack of rheumatism confines him to his\nchamber for many days. His valet is found out to be clumsy and awkward\nin assisting him to put on his flannel gloves; the housekeeper, who is\ncalled up to receive instructions about some particular broth that he\nrequires, is asked to officiate, and suggests so many little comforts,\nand evinces so much sympathy for his sufferings, that she is soon\ninstalled as nurse.\n\nBy administering to his wants, and still more by flattery and\nobsequiousness, she soon renders herself indispensable to the invalid.\nShe is proclaimed to be a treasure, and her accounts, which hitherto\nhad been sharply scrutinised and severely censured, are henceforth\nallowed to pass unblamed, and, consequently, soon amount to double the\nsum which had formerly, and with reason, been found fault with. The\nslightest symptom of illness is magnified into a serious attack by the\nsupposed affectionate and assiduous nurse, until her master, in\ncompliance with her advice, becomes a confirmed hypochondriac, whom she\ngoverns despotically under a show of devoted attachment.\n\nShe has, by slow but sure degrees, alienated him from all his\nrelatives, and banished from his house the few friends whom she\nbelieved possessed any influence over him. Having rendered herself\nessential to his comfort, she menaces him continually with the threat\nof leaving his service; and is only induced to remain by a considerable\nincrease to her salary, though not, as she asserts, by any interested\nmotive.\n\nShe lately informed her master, that she was \"very sorry--very sorry,\nindeed--but it was time for her to secure her future comfort; and M.\n----, the rich grocer, had proposed marriage to her, and offered a good\nsettlement. It would be a great grief to her to leave so kind a master,\nespecially as she knew no one to whom she could confide the care of\nhim; but a settlement of 4000 francs a-year was not to be refused, and\nshe might never again receive so good an offer.\"\n\nThe proposal of the rich grocer, which never existed but in her own\nfertile brain, is rejected, and her continuance as housekeeper and\nnurse secured by a settlement of a similar sum made on her by her\nmaster; who congratulates himself on having accomplished so\nadvantageous a bargain, while she is laughing with the valet at his\ncredulity.\n\nThis same valet, finding her influence to be omnipotent with his\nmaster, determines on marrying her secretly, that they may join in\nplundering the valetudinarian, whose infirmities furnish a perpetual\nsubject for the coarse pleasantries of both these ungrateful menials.\n\nShe is now giving him his daily walk on the sunny side of the\nLuxembourg Gardens. See how she turns abruptly down an alley, in\ndespite of his request to continue where he was: but the truth is, her\nArgus eyes have discovered his niece and her beautiful children walking\nat a distance; and, as she has not only prevented their admission to\nhis house, but concealed their visits, intercepted their letters,\nmaking him believe they are absent from Paris and have forgotten him,\nshe now precludes their meeting; while to his querulous murmurs at\nbeing hurried along, she answers that the alley she has taken him to is\nmore sheltered.\n\nIt is true the invalid sometimes half suspects, not only that he is\ngoverned, but somewhat despotically, too, by the worthy and\naffectionate creature, whose sole study it is to take care of his\nhealth. He considers it hard to be debarred from sending for one of his\nold friends to play a party at picquet, or a game at chess with him,\nduring the long winter evenings; and he thinks it would be pleasanter\nto have some of his female relatives occasionally to dinner: but as the\nleast hint on these subjects never fails to produce ill-humour on the\npart of the \"good Jeanette,\" who declares that such unreasonable\nindulgence would inevitably destroy the precious health of Monsieur, he\nsubmits to her will; and while wholly governed by an ignorant and\nartful servant, can still smile that he is free from being henpecked by\na wife.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\nIn no part of Paris are so many children to be seen us in the gardens\nof the Luxembourg. At every step may be encountered groups of playful\ncreatures of every age, from the infant slumbering in its nurse's arms,\nto the healthful girl holding her little brother or sister by the hand\nas her little charge toddles along; or the manly boy, who gives his arm\nto his younger sister with all the air of protection of manhood.\n\nWhat joyous sounds of mirth come from each group--the clear voices\nringing pleasantly on the ear, from creatures fair and blooming as the\nflowers of the rich _parterres_ among which they wander! How each group\nexamines the other--half-disposed to join in each other's sports, but\nwithheld by a vague fear of making the first advances--a fear which\nindicates that even already civilisation and the artificial habits it\nengenders, have taught them the restraint it imposes!\n\nThe nurses, too, scrutinise each other, and their little masters and\nmisses, as they meet. They take in at a glance the toilettes of each,\nand judge with an extraordinary accuracy the station of life to which\nthey appertain.\n\nThe child of noble birth is known by the simplicity of its dress and\nthe good manners of its _bonne_; while that of _the parvenu_ is at once\nrecognised by the showiness and expensiveness of its clothes, and the\nsuperciliousness of its nurse, who, accustomed to the purse-proud\npretensions of her employers, values nothing so much as all the\nattributes that indicate the possession of wealth.\n\nThe little children look wistfully at each other every time they meet;\nthen begin to smile, and at length approach, and join, half-timidly,\nhalf-laughingly, in each other's sports. The nurses, too, draw near,\nenter into a conversation, in which each endeavours to insinuate the\nimportance of her young charge, and consequently her own; while the\nchildren have already contracted an intimacy, which is exemplified by\nrunning hand-in-hand together, their clear jocund voices being mingled.\n\nIt is a beautiful sight to behold these gay creatures, who have little\nmore than passed the first two or three years of life, with the roses\nof health glowing on their dimpled cheeks, and the joyousness of\ninfancy sparkling in their eyes.\n\nThey know nought of existence but its smiles; and, caressed by doating\nparents, have not a want unsatisfied. Entering life all hope and\ngaiety, what a contrast do they offer to the groups of old men who must\nso soon leave it, who are basking in the sunshine so near them! Yet\nthey, too, have had their hours of joyous infancy; and, old and faded\nas they are, they have been doated on, as they gambolled like the happy\nlittle beings they now pause to contemplate.\n\nThere was something touching in the contrast of youth and age brought\nthus together, and I thought that more than one of the old men seemed\nto feel it as they looked on the happy children.\n\nI met my new acquaintance, Dr. P----, who was walking with two or three\n_savans_; and, having spoken to him, he joined us in our promenade, and\ngreatly added to its pleasure by his sensible remarks and by his\ncheerful tone of mind. He told me that the sight of the fine children\ndaily to be met in the Luxembourg Gardens, was as exhilarating to his\nspirits as the gay flowers in the _parterre_ and that he had frequently\nprescribed a walk here to those whose minds stood in need of such a\nstimulant.\n\nThe General and Countess d'Orsay arrived yesterday from their\n_château_, in Franche-Comté. A long correspondence had taught me to\nappreciate the gifted mind of Madame, who, to solid attainments, joins\na sparkling wit and vivacity that render her conversation delightful.\n\nThe Countess d'Orsay has been a celebrated beauty; and, though a\ngrandmother, still retains considerable traces of it. Her countenance\nis so _spirituelle_ and piquant, that it gives additional point to the\nclever things she perpetually utters; and what greatly enhances her\nattractions is the perfect freedom from any of the airs of a _bel\nesprit_, and the total exemption from affectation that distinguishes\nher.\n\nGeneral d'Orsay, known from his youth as Le Beau d'Orsay, still\njustifies the appellation, for he is the handsomest man of his age that\nI have ever beheld. It is said that when the Emperor Napoleon first saw\nhim, he observed that he would make an admirable model for a Jupiter,\nso noble and commanding was the character of his beauty.\n\nLike most people remarkable for good looks, General d'Orsay is reported\nto have been wholly free from vanity; to which, perhaps, may be\nattributed the general assent accorded to his personal attractions\nwhich, while universally admitted, excited none of the envy and\nill-will which such advantages but too often draw on their possessor.\nThere is a calm and dignified simplicity in the manners of General\nd'Orsay, that harmonises well with his lofty bearing.\n\nIt is very gratifying to witness the affection and good intelligence\nthat reign in the domestic circles in France. Grandfathers and\ngrandmothers here meet with an attention from their children and\ngrandchildren, the demonstrations of which are very touching; and I\noften see gay and brilliant parties abandoned by some of those with\nwhom I am in the habit of daily intercourse, in order that they may\npass the evenings with their aged relatives.\n\nFrequently do I see the beautiful Duchesse de Guiche enter the _salon_\nof her grandmother, sparkling in diamonds, after having hurried away\nfrom some splendid _fête_, of which she was the brightest ornament, to\nspend an hour with her before she retired to rest; and the Countess\nd'Orsay is so devoted to her mother, that nearly her whole time is\npassed with her.\n\nIt is pleasant to see the mother and grandmother inspecting and\ncommenting on the toilette of the lovely daughter, of whom they are so\njustly proud, while she is wholly occupied in inquiring about the\nhealth of each, or answering their questions relative to that of her\nchildren.\n\nThe good and venerable Duc de Gramont examines his daughter-in-law\nthrough his eyeglass, and, with an air of paternal affection, observes\nto General d'Orsay, \"How well our daughter looks to-night!\"\n\nMadame Craufurd, referring to her great age last evening, said to me,\nand a tear stole down her cheek while she spoke:\n\n     \"Ah, my dear friend! how can I think that I must soon leave\n     all those who love me so much, and whom I so dote on, without\n     bitter regret? Yes, I am too happy here to be as resigned as\n     I ought to be to meet death.\"\n\nSaw Potier in the _Ci-devant Jeune Homme_ last night. It is an\nexcellent piece of acting, from the first scene where he appears in all\nthe infirmity of age, in his night-cap and flannel dressing-gown, to\nthe last, in which he portrays tho would-be young man. His face, his\nfigure, his cough, are inimitable; and when he recounts to his servant\nthe gaieties of the previous night, the hollow cheek, sunken eye, and\nhurried breathing of the \"Ci-devant Jeune Homme\" render the scene most\nimpressive.\n\nNothing could be more comic than the metamorphose effected in his\nappearance by dress, except it were his endeavours to assume an air and\ncountenance suitable to the juvenility of his toilette; while, at\nintervals, some irrepressible symptom of infirmity reminded the\naudience of the pangs the effort to appear young inflicted on him.\nPotier is a finished actor, and leaves nothing to be wished, except\nthat he may long continue to perform and delight his audience as last\nnight.\n\nDined yesterday at the Countess d'Orsay's, with a large family party.\nThe only stranger was Sir Francis Burdett. A most agreeable dinner,\nfollowed by a very pleasant evening. I have seldom seen any Englishman\nenjoy French society as much as the worthy baronet does. He speaks the\nlanguage with great facility, is well acquainted with its literature,\nand has none of the prejudices which militate so much against acquiring\na perfect knowledge of the manners and customs of a foreign country.\n\nFrench society has decidedly one great superiority over English, and\nthat is its freedom from those topics which too often engross so\nconsiderable a portion of male conversation, even in the presence of\nladies, in England. I have often passed the evening previously and\nsubsequently to a race, in which many of the men present took a lively\ninterest, without ever hearing it made the subject of conversation.\nCould this be said of a party in England, on a similar occasion?\n\nNor do the men here talk of their shooting or hunting before women, as\nwith us. This is a great relief, for in England many a woman is doomed\nto listen to interminable tales of slaughtered grouse, partridges, and\npheasants; of hair breadth \"'scapes by flood and field,\" and venturous\nleaps, the descriptions of which leave one in doubt whether the\nnarrator or his horse be the greater animal of the two, and render the\npoor listener more fatigued by the recital than either was by the\nlongest chase.\n\nA dissertation on the comparative merits of Manton's, Lancaster's, and\nMoore's guns, and the advantage of percussion locks, it is true,\ngenerally diversifies the conversation.\n\nThen how edifying it is to hear the pedigrees of horses--the odds for\nand against the favourite winning such or such a race--the good or bad\nbooks of the talkers--the hedging or backing of the betters! Yet all\nthis are women condemned to hear on the eve of a race, or during the\nshooting or hunting season, should their evil stars bring them into the\nsociety of any of the Nimrods or sportsmen of the day, who think it not\nonly allowable to devote nearly all their time to such pursuits, but to\ntalk of little else.\n\nThe woman who aims at being popular in her county, must not only listen\npatiently, but evince a lively interest in these _intellectual_\noccupations; while, if the truth was confessed, she is thoroughly\n_ennuyée_ by these details of them: or if not, it must be inferred that\nshe has lost much of the refinement of mind and taste peculiar to the\nwell-educated portion of her sex.\n\nI do not object to men liking racing, hunting, and shooting. The first\npreserves the breed of horses, for which England is so justly\ncelebrated, and hunting keeps up the skill in horsemanship in which our\nmen excel. What I do object to is their making these pursuits the\nconstant topics of conversation before women, instead of selecting\nthose more suitable to the tastes and habits of the latter.\n\nThere is none of the affectation of avoiding subjects supposed to be\nuninteresting to women visible in the men here. They do not utter with\na smile--half pity, half condescension,--\"we must not talk politics\nbefore the ladies;\" they merely avoid entering into discussions, or\nexhibiting party spirit, and shew their deference for female society by\nspeaking on literature, on which they politely seem to take for granted\nthat women are well informed.\n\nPerhaps this deferential treatment of the gentler sex may not be wholly\ncaused by the good breeding of the men in France; for I strongly\nsuspect that the women here would be very little disposed to submit to\nthe _nonchalance_ that prompts the conduct I have referred to in\nEngland, and that any man who would make his horses or his field-sports\nthe topic of discourse in their presence, would soon find himself\nexpelled from their society.\n\nFrenchwomen still think, and with reason, that they govern the tone of\nthe circles in which they move, and look with jealousy on any\ninfringement of the respectful attention they consider to be their due.\n\nA few nights ago I saw the Duchesse de Guiche, on her return from a\nreception at court, sparkling in diamonds, and looking so beautiful\nthat she reminded me of Burke's description of the lovely and\nunfortunate Marie-Antoinette. To-day I thought her still more\nattractive, when, wearing only a simple white _peignoir_, and her\nmatchless hair bound tightly round her classically shaped head, I saw\nher enacting the part of _garde-malade_ to her children, who have\ncaught the measles.\n\nWith a large, and well-chosen nursery-establishment, she would confide\nher precious charge to no care but her own, and moved from each little\nwhite bed to the other with noiseless step and anxious glance, bringing\ncomfort to the dear little invalid in each. No wonder that her children\nadore her, for never was there so devoted a mother.\n\nIn the meridian of youth and beauty, and filling so brilliant a\nposition in France, it is touching to witness how wholly engrossed this\namiable young woman's thoughts are by her domestic duties. She incites,\nby sharing, the studies of her boys; and already is her little girl,\nowing to her mother's judicious system, cited as a model.\n\nIt was pleasant to see the Duc, when released from his attendance at\ncourt, hurrying into the sick chamber of his children, and their\nlanguid eyes, lighting up with a momentary animation, and their\nfeverish lips relaxing into a smile, at the sound of his well-known\nvoice. And this is the couple considered to be \"the glass of fashion\nand the mould of form,\" the observed of all observers, of the courtly\ncircle at Paris!\n\nWho could behold them as I have done, in that sick room, without\nacknowledging that, despite of all that has been said of the\ndeleterious influence of courts on the feelings of those who live much\nin them, the truly good pass unharmed through the dangerous ordeal?\n\nWent to the Théâtre des Nouveautés last night, where I saw _La Maison\ndu Rempart_. The Parisians seem to have decided taste for bringing\nscenes of riot and disorder on the stage; and the tendency of such\nexhibitions is any thing but salutary with so inflammable a people, and\nin times like the present.\n\nOne of the scenes of _La Maison du Rempart_ represents an armed mob\ndemolishing the house of a citizen--an act of violence that seemed to\nafford great satisfaction to the majority of the audience; and, though\nthe period represented is that of the _Fronde_, the acts of the rabble\nstrongly assimilated with those of the same class in later times, when\nthe revolution let loose on hapless France the worst of all tyrants--a\nreckless and sanguinary mob. I cannot help feeling alarmed at the\nconsequences likely to result from such performances. Sparks of fire\nflung among gunpowder are not more dangerous. Shewing a populace what\nthey can effect by brutal force is a dangerous experiment; it is like\nletting a tame lion see how easily he could overpower his keepers.\n\nMr. Cuthbert and M. Charles Laffitte dined here yesterday. Both are\nexcellent specimens of their countries; the former being well-informed\nand agreeable, and the latter possessing all the good sense we believe\nto be peculiar to an Englishman, with the high breeding that appertains\nto a thoroughly well-educated Frenchman.\n\nThe advance of civilization was evident in both these gentlemen--the\nEnglishman speaking French with purity and fluency, and the Frenchman\nspeaking English like a born Briton. Twenty years ago, this would have\nbeen considered a very rare occurrence, while now it excites little\nremark. But it is not alone the languages of the different countries\nthat Mr. Cuthbert and M. Charles Laffitte have acquired, for both are\nwell acquainted with the literature of each, which renders their\nsociety very agreeable.\n\nSpent last evening in the Rue d'Anjou, where I met Lady Combermere, the\nDowager Lady Hawarden, and Mrs. Masters. Lady Combermere is lively and\nagreeable, _un peu romanesque_, which gives great originality to her\nconversation, and sings Mrs. Arkwright's beautiful ballads with great\nfeeling.\n\nMr. Charles Grant[4] dined here yesterday. He is a very sensible man,\npossessing a vast fund of general information, with gentle and\nhighly-polished manners. What a charm there is in agreeable manners,\nand how soon one feels at ease with those who possess them!\n\nSpent, or mis-spent, a great portion of the day in visiting the\ncuriosity shops on the _Quai Voltaire_, and came away from them with a\nlighter purse than I entered. There is no resisting, at least I find it\nso, the exquisite _porcelaine de Sèvres_, off which the dainty dames of\nthe reign of Louis the Fourteenth feasted, or which held their\n_bouquets_, or _pot pourri_. An _étui of_ gold set with oriental agates\nand brilliants, and a _flacon_ of rock crystal, both of which once\nappertained to Madame de Sévigné, vanquished my prudence.\n\nWould that with the possession of these articles, often used by her, I\ncould also inherit the matchless grace with which her pen could invest\nevery subject it touched! But, alas! it is easier to acquire the\nbeautiful _bijouterie_, rendered still more valuable by having belonged\nto celebrated people, than the talent that gained their celebrity; and\nso I must be content with inhaling _esprit de rose_ from the _flacon_\nof Madame de Sévigné, without aspiring to any portion of the _esprit_\nfor which she was so distinguished.\n\nI am now rich in the possession of objects once belonging to remarkable\nwomen, and I am not a little content with my acquisitions. I can boast\nthe gold and enamelled pincushion of Madame de Maintenon, heart-shaped,\nand stuck as full of pins as the hearts of the French Protestants were\nwith thorns by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes; to which she is\nsaid to have so greatly contributed by her counsel to her infatuated\nlover, Louis the Fourteenth. I can indulge in a pinch of snuff from the\n_tabatière_ of the Marquise de Rambouillet, hold my court-plaster in\nthe _boîte à mouches_ of Ninon de l'Enclos, and cut ribands with the\nscissors of Madame de Deffand.\n\nThis desire of obtaining objects that have belonged to celebrated\npeople may be, and often is, considered puerile; but confess to the\nweakness, and the contemplation of the little memorials I have named\nawakens recollections in my mind fraught with interest.\n\nI can fancy Madame de Sévigné, who was as amiable as she was clever,\nand whose tenderness towards her daughter is demonstrated so naturally\nand touchingly in the letters she addressed to her, holding the\n_flacon_ now mine to the nostrils of Madame de Grignan, in whose health\nshe was always so much more interested than in her own.\n\nI can see in my mind's eye the precise and demure Madame de Maintenon\ntaking a pin from the very pincushion now before me, to prevent the\nopening of her kerchief, and so conceal even her throat from the prying\neyes of the aged voluptuary, whose passions the wily prude is said to\nhave excited by a concealment of a portion of her person that had, in\nall probability, ceased to possess charms enough to produce this\neffect, if revealed.\n\nThis extreme reserve on the part of the mature coquette evinced a\nprofound knowledge of mankind, and, above all, of him on whom she\npractised her arts. The profuse display of the bust and shoulders in\nthose days, when the ladies of the court left so little to the\nimagination of the amorous monarch on whose heart so many of them had\ndesigns, must have impaired the effect meant to have been achieved by\nthe indelicate exposure; for--hear it ye fair dames, with whose snowy\nbusts and dimpled shoulders the eyes of your male acquaintance are as\nfamiliar as with your faces!--the charms of nature, however beautiful,\nfall short of the ideal perfection accorded to them by the imagination,\nwhen unseen. The clever Maintenon, aware of this fact, of which the\nless wise of her sex are ignorant or forgetful, afforded a striking\ncontrast in her dress to the women around her, and piquing first the\ncuriosity, and then the passions, of the old libertine, acquired an\ninfluence over him when she had long passed the meridian of her\npersonal attractions, which youthful beauties, who left him no room to\ndoubt their charms, or to exaggerate them as imagination is prone to\ndo, could never accomplish.\n\nThis very pincushion, with its red velvet heart stuck with pins, was\nprobably a gift from the enamoured Louis, and meant to be symbolical of\nthe state of his own; which, in hardness, it might be truly said to\nresemble. It may have often been placed on her table when Maintenon was\npaying the penalty of her hard-earned greatness by the painful task of\nendeavouring--as she acknowledged--to amuse a man who was no longer\namusable.\n\nCould it speak, it might relate the wearisome hours passed in a palace\n(for the demon _Ennui_ cannot be expelled even from the most brilliant;\nnay, prefers, it is said, to select them for his abode), and we should\nlearn, that while an object of envy to thousands, the mistress, or\nunacknowledged wife of _le Grand Monarque_, was but little more happy\nthan the widow of Scarron when steeped in poverty.\n\nMadame de Maintenon discovered what hundreds before and since have\ndone--that splendour and greatness cannot confer happiness; and, while\ntrying to amuse a man who, though possessed of sovereign power, has\nlost all sense of enjoyment, must have reverted, perhaps with a sigh,\nto the little chamber in which she so long soothed the sick bed of the\nwitty octogenarian, Scarron; who, gay and cheerful to the last, could\nmake her smile by his sprightly and _spirituelles_ sallies, which\nneither the evils of poverty nor pain could subdue.\n\nPerhaps this pincushion has lain on her table when Madame de Maintenon\nlistened to the animating conversation of Racine, or heard him read\naloud, with that spirit and deep pathos for which his reading was so\nremarkable, his _Esther_ and _Alhalie_, previously to their performance\nat St.-Cyr.\n\nThat she did not make his peace with the king, when he offended him by\nwriting an essay to prove that long wars, however likely to reflect\nglory on a sovereign, were sure to entail misery on his subjects, shews\nthat either her influence over the mind of Louis was much less powerful\nthan has been believed, or that she was deficient in the feelings that\nmust have prompted her to exert it by pleading for him.\n\nThe ungenerous conduct of the king in banishing from his court a man\nwhose genius shed a purer lustre over it than all the battles Boileau\nhas sung, and for a cause that merited praise instead of displeasure,\nhas always appeared to me to be indicative of great meanness as well as\nhardness of heart; and while lamenting the weakness of Racine,\noriginating in a morbid sensibility that rendered his disgrace at court\nso painful and humiliating to the poet as to cause his death, I am\nstill less disposed to pardon the sovereign that could thus excite into\nundue action a sensibility, the effects of which led its victim to the\ngrave.\n\nThe diamond-mounted _tabatière_ now on my table once occupied a place\non that of the Marquise de Rambouillet, in that hôtel so celebrated,\nnot only for the efforts made by its coterie towards refining the\nmanners and morals of her day, but the language also, until the\naffectation to which its members carried their notions of purity,\nexposed them to a ridicule that tended to subvert the influence they\nhad previously exercised over society.\n\nMolière--the inimitable Molière--may have been permitted the high\ndistinction of taking a pinch of snuff from it, while planning his\n_Précieuses Ridicules_, which, _malgré_ his disingenuous disavowal of\nthe satire being aimed at the Hôtel Rambouillet, evidently found its\nsubject there. I cannot look at the snuff-box without being reminded of\nthe brilliant circle which its former mistress assembled around her,\nand among which Molière had such excellent opportunities of studying\nthe peculiarities of the class he subsequently painted.\n\nLittle did its members imagine, when he was admitted to it, the use he\nwould make of the privilege; and great must have been their surprise\nand mortification, though not avowed, at the first representation of\nthe _Précieuses Ridicules_, in which many of them must have discovered\nthe resemblance to themselves, though the clever author professed only\nto ridicule their imitators. _Les Femmes Savantes_, though produced\nmany years subsequently, also found the originals of its characters in\nthe same source whence Molière painted _Les Précieuses Ridicules_.\n\nI can fancy him slily listening to the theme proposed to the assembly\nby Mademoiselle Scudéry--the _Sarraïdes_, as she was styled--\"Whether a\nlover jealous, a lover despised, a lover separated from the object of\nhis tenderness, or him who has lost her by death, was to be esteemed\nthe most unhappy.\"\n\nAt a later period of his life, Molière might have solved the question\nfrom bitter personal experience, for few ever suffered more from the\npangs of jealousy, and assuredly no one has painted with such\nvigour--though the comic often prevails over the serious in his\ndelineations--the effects of a passion any thing but comic to him.\nStrange power of genius, to make others laugh at incidents which had\noften tormented himself, and to be able to give humour to characters in\nvarious comedies, actuated by the feelings to which he had so\nfrequently been a victim!\n\nI can picture to myself the fair _Julie d'Angennes_, who bestowed not\nher hand on the _Duc de Montausier_ until he had served as many years\nin seeking it as Jacob had served to gain that of Rachel, and until she\nhad passed her thirtieth year (in order that his passion should become\nas purified from all grossness, as was the language spoken among the\ncircle in which she lived), receiving with dignified reserve the finely\npainted flowers and poems to illustrate them, which formed the\ncelebrated _Guirlande de Julie_, presented to her by her courtly\nadmirer.\n\nI see pass before me the fair and elegant dames of that galaxy of wit\nand beauty, Mesdames de Longueville, Lafayette, and de Sévigné,\nfluttering their fans as they listened and replied to the gallant\ncompliments of Voiture, Ménage, Chapelain, Desmarets, or De Réaux, or\nto the _spirituelle causerie_ of Chamfort.\n\nWhat a pity that a society, no less useful than brilliant at its\ncommencement, should have degenerated into a coterie, remarkable at\nlast but for its fantastic and false notions of refinement, exhibited\nin a manner that deserved the ridicule it called down!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n\nSpent last evening in the Rue d'Anjou: met there la Marquise de\nPouleprie, and the usual _habitués_. She is a delightful person; for\nage has neither chilled the warmth of her heart, nor impaired the\nvivacity of her manners. I had heard much of her; for she is greatly\nbeloved by the Duchesse de Guiche and all the De Gramont family; and\nshe, knowing their partiality to me, treated me rather as an old than\nas a new acquaintance.\n\nTalking of old times, to which the Duc de Gramont reverted, the\nMarquise mentioned having seen the celebrated Madame du Barry in the\ngarden at Versailles, when she (the Marquise) was a very young girl.\nShe described her as having a most animated and pleasant countenance,\n_un petit nez retroussé_, brilliant eyes, full red lips, and as being\naltogether a very attractive person.\n\nThe Marquise de Pouleprie accompanied the French royal family to\nEngland, and remained with them there during the emigration. She told\nme that once going through the streets of London in a carriage, with\nthe French king, during an election at Westminster, the mob, ignorant\nof his rank, insisted that he and his servants should take off their\nhats, and cry out \"Long live Sir Francis Burdett!\" which his majesty\ndid with great good humour, and laughed heartily after.\n\nWent last night to see Mademoiselle Mars, in \"Valérie.\" It was a\nfinished performance, and worthy of her high reputation. Never was\nthere so musical a voice as hers! Every tone of it goes direct to the\nheart, and its intonations soothe and charm the ear. Her countenance,\ntoo, is peculiarly expressive. Even when her eyes, in the _rôle_ she\nenacted last night, were fixed, and supposed to be sightless, her\ncountenance was still beautiful. There is a harmony in its various\nexpressions that accords perfectly with her clear, soft, and liquid\nvoice; and the united effect of both these attractions renders her\nirresistible.\n\nNever did Art so strongly resemble Nature as in the acting of this\nadmirable _artiste_. She identifies herself so completely with the part\nshe performs, that she not only believes herself for the time being the\nheroine she represents, but makes others do so too. There was not a dry\neye in the whole of the female part of the audience last night--a\nhomage to her power that no other actress on the French stage could now\ncommand.\n\nThe style, too, of Mademoiselle Mars' acting is the most difficult of\nall; because there is no exaggeration, no violence in it. The same\ndifference exists between it and that of other actresses, as between a\nhighly finished portrait and a glaringly coloured transparency. The\nfeminine, the graceful, and the natural, are never lost sight of for a\nmoment.\n\nThe French are admirable critics of acting, and are keenly alive to the\nbeauties of a chaste and finished style, like that of Mademoiselle\nMars. In Paris there is no playing to the galleries, and for a simple\nreason:--the occupants of the galleries here are as fastidious as those\nof the boxes, and any thing like outraging nature would be censured by\nthem: whereas, in other countries, the broad and the exaggerated almost\ninvariably find favour with the gods.\n\nThe same pure and refined taste that characterises the acting of\nMademoiselle Mars presides also over her toilette, which is always\nappropriate and becoming.\n\nAccustomed to the agreeable mixture of literary men in London society,\nI observe, with regret, their absence in that of Paris. I have\nrepeatedly questioned people why this is, but have never been able to\nobtain a satisfactory answer. It tells much against the good taste of\nthose who can give the tone to society here, that literary men should\nbe left out of it; and if the latter _will_ not mingle with the\naristocratic circles they are to blame, for the union of both is\nadvantageous to the interests of each.\n\nParisian society is very exclusive, and is divided into small coteries,\ninto which a stranger finds it difficult to become initiated. Large\nroutes are rare, and not at all suited to the tastes of the French\npeople; who comment with merriment, if not with ridicule, on the\nevening parties in London, where the rooms being too small to contain\nhalf the guests invited, the stairs and ante-rooms are filled by a\ncrowd, in which not only the power of conversing, but almost of\nrespiring is impeded.\n\nThe French ladies attribute the want of freshness so remarkable in the\ntoilettes of Englishwomen, to their crowded routes, and the knowledge\nof its being impossible for a robe, or at least of a greater portion of\none than covers a bust, to be seen; which induces the fair wearers to\neconomise, by rarely indulging in new dresses.\n\nAt Paris certain ladies of distinction open their _salons_, on one\nevening of each week, to a circle of their acquaintances, not too\nnumerous to banish that ease and confidence which form the delight of\nsociety. Each lady takes an evening for her receptions, and no one\ninterferes with her arrangements by giving a party on the same night.\nThe individuals of each circle are thus in the habit of being\ncontinually in each other's society; consequently the etiquette and\nformality, so _gênant_ among acquaintances who seldom meet, are\nbanished.\n\nTo preserve the charm of these unceremonious _réunions_, strangers are\nseldom admitted to them, but are invited to the balls, dinners, or\nlarge parties, where they see French people _en grande lenue_, both in\ndress and manner, instead of penetrating into the more agreeable\nparties to which I have referred, where the graceful _négligé_ of a\n_demi-toilette_ prevails, and the lively _causerie_ of the _habitués de\nla maison_ supersedes the constraint of ceremony.\n\nSuch a society is precisely the sort of one that literary men would, I\nshould suppose, like to mingle in, to unbend their minds from graver\nstudies, and yet not pass their time unprofitably; for in it, politics,\nliterature, and the fine arts, generally furnish the topics of\nconversation: from which, however, the warmth of discussion, which too\nfrequently renders politics a prohibited subject, is excluded, or the\npedantry that sometimes spoils literary _causerie_ is banished.\n\nFrench people, male and female, talk well; give their opinions with\nreadiness and vivacity; often striking out ideas as original as they\nare brilliant; highly suggestive to more profound thinkers, but which\nthey dispense with as much prodigality as a spendthrift throws away his\nsmall coin, conscious of having more at his disposal. Quick of\nperception, they jump, rather than march, to a conclusion, at which an\nEnglishman or a German would arrive leisurely, enabled to tell all the\nparticulars of the route, but which the Frenchman would know little of\nfrom having arrived by some shorter road. This quickness of perception\nexempts them from the necessity of devoting much of the time and study\nwhich the English or Germans employ in forming opinions, but it also\nprecludes their being able to reason as justly or as gravely on those\nthey form.\n\nWalked in the gardens of the Tuileries to-day. What a contrast their\nfrequenters offer to those of the Luxembourg! In the Tuileries, the\npromenaders look as if they only walked there to display their tasteful\ndresses and pretty persons.\n\nThe women eye each other as they pass, and can tell at a glance whether\ntheir respective _chapeaux_ have come from the _atelier_ of Herbault,\nor the less _rechercé magasin de modes_ of some more humble _modiste_.\nHow rapidly can they see whether the Cashmere shawl of some passing\ndame owes its rich but sober tints to an Indian loom, or to the fabric\nof M. Ternaux, who so skilfully imitates the exotic luxury; and what a\ndifference does the circumstance make in their estimation of the\nwearer! The beauty of a woman, however great it may be, excites less\nenvy in the minds of her own sex in France, than does the possession of\na fine Cashmere, or a _garniture_ of real Russian sable--objects of\ngeneral desire to every Parisian _belle_.\n\nI met few handsome women to-day, but these few were remarkably\nstriking. In Kensington Gardens I should have encountered thrice as\nmany; but there I should also have seen more plain ones than here. Not\nthat Englishwomen _en masse_ are not better-looking than the French,\nbut that these last are so skilful in concealing defects, and revealing\nbeauties by the appropriateness and good taste in their choice of\ndress, that even the plain cease to appear so; and many a woman looks\npiquant, if not pretty, at Paris, thanks to her _modiste_, her\n_couturière_, and her _cordonnier_, who, without their \"artful aid,\"\nwould be plain indeed.\n\nIt is pleasant to behold groups of well-dressed women walking, as only\nFrench women ever do walk, nimbly moving their little feet _bien\nchaussé_, and with an air half timid, half _espiègle_, that elicits the\nadmiration they affect to avoid. The rich and varied material of their\nrobes, the pretty _chapeaux_, from which peep forth such coquettish\nglances, the modest assurance--for their self-possession amounts\nprecisely to that--and the ease and elegance of their carriage, give\nthem attractions we might seek for in vain in the women of other\ncountries, however superior these last may be in beauty of complexion\nor roundness of _contour_, for which French women in general are not\nremarkable.\n\nThe men who frequent the gardens of the Tuileries are of a different\norder to those met with in the Luxembourg. They consist chiefly of\nmilitary men and young fashionables, who go to admire the pretty women,\nand elderly and middle-aged ones, who meet in knots and talk politics\nwith all the animation peculiar to their nation. Children do not abound\nin the walks here, as in the Luxembourg; and those to be seen are\nevidently brought by some fond mother, proud of exhibiting her boys and\ngirls in their smart dresses.\n\nThe Tuileries Gardens, so beautiful in summer, are not without their\nattractions in winter. The trees, though leafless, look well, rearing\ntheir tall branches towards the clear sky, and the statues and vases\nseen through vistas of evergreen shrubs, with the gilded railing which\ngives back the rays of the bright, though cold sun, and the rich\nvelvets of every hue in which the women are enveloped, giving them the\nappearance of moving _parterres_ of dahlias, all render the scene a\nvery exhilarating one to the spirits.\n\nI observe a difference in the usages _de moeurs_ at Paris, and in those\nof London, of which an ignorance might lead to give offence. In\nEngland, a lady is expected to bow to a gentleman before he presumes to\ndo so to her, thus leaving her the choice of acknowledging his\nacquaintance, or not; but in France it is otherwise, for a man takes\noff his hat to every woman whom he has ever met in society, although he\ndoes not address her, unless she encourages him to do so.\n\nIn Paris, if two men are walking or riding together, and one of them\nbows to a lady of his acquaintance, the other also takes off his hat,\nas a mark of respect to the lady known to his friend, although he is\nnot acquainted with her. The mode of salutation is also much more\ndeferential towards women in France than in England. The hat is held a\nsecond longer off the head, the bow is lower, and the smile of\nrecognition is more _amiable_, by which, I mean, that it is meant to\ndisplay the pleasure experienced by the meeting.\n\nIt is true that the really well-bred Englishmen are not to be surpassed\nin politeness and good manners by those of any other country, but all\nare not such; and I have seen instances of men in London acknowledging\nthe presence of ladies, by merely touching, instead of taking off,\ntheir hats when bowing to them; and though I accounted for this\nsolecism in good breeding by the belief that it proceeded from the\npersons practising it wearing wigs, I discovered that there was not\neven so good an excuse as the fear of deranging them, and that their\nincivility proceeded from ignorance, or _nonchalance_, while the glum\ncountenance of him who bowed betrayed rather a regret for the necessity\nof touching his beaver, than a pleasure at meeting her for whom the\nsalute was intended.\n\nTime flies away rapidly here, and its flight seems to me to mark two\ndistinct states of existence. My mornings are devoted wholly to reading\nhistory, poetry, or _belles lettres_, which abstract me so completely\nfrom the actual present to the past, that the hours so disposed of\nappear to be the actual life, and those given up to society the shadowy\nand unreal.\n\nThis forcible contrast between the two portions of the same day, gives\ncharms to both, though I confess the hours passed in my library are\nthose which leave behind them the pleasantest reflections. I\nexperienced this sentiment when in the hey-day of youth, and surrounded\nby some of the most gifted persons in England; but now, as age\nadvances, the love of solitude and repose increases, and a life spent\nin study appears to me to be the one of all others the most desirable,\nas the enjoyment of the best thoughts of the best authors is preferable\neven to their conversation, could it be had, and, consequently to that\nof the cleverest men to be met with in society.\n\nSome pleasant people dined here yesterday. Among them was Colonel\nCaradoc, the son of our old friend Lord Howden. He possesses great and\nversatile information, is good-looking, well-bred, and has superior\nabilities; in short, he has all the means, and appliances to boot, to\nmake a distinguished figure, in life, if he lacks not the ambition and\nenergy to use them; but, born to station and fortune, he may want the\nincitement which the absence of these advantages furnishes, and be\ncontent to enjoy the good he already has, instead of seeking greater\ndistinction.\n\nColonel Caradoc's conversation is brilliant and epigrammatic; and if\noccasionally a too evident consciousness of his own powers is suffered\nto be revealed in it, those who know it to be well-founded will pardon\nhis self-complacency, and not join with the persons, and they are not\nfew, whose _amour-propre_ is wounded by the display of his, and who\nquestion, what really is not questionable, the foundation on which his\npretensions are based.\n\nThe clever, like the handsome, to be pardoned for being so, should\naffect a humility they are but too seldom in the habit of feeling; and\nto acquire popularity must appear unconscious of meriting it. This is\none of the many penalties entailed on the gifted in mind or person.\n\n_January 1st_, 1829.--There is always something grave, if not awful, in\nthe opening of a new year; for who knows what may occur to render it\nmemorable for ever! If the bygone one has been marked by aught sad, the\narrival of the new reminds one of the lapse of time; and though the\ndestroyer brings patience, we sigh to think that we may have new\noccasions for its difficult exercise. Who can forbear from trembling\nlest the opening year may find us at its close with a lessened circle.\nSome, now dear and confided in, may become estranged, or one dearer\nthan life may be snatched away whose place never can be supplied! The\nthought is too painful to be borne, and makes one look around with\nincreased affection on those dear to us.\n\nThe custom prevalent at Paris of offering an exchange of gifts on the\nfirst day of the new year was, perhaps, originally intended to banish\nthe melancholy reflections such an epoch is calculated to awaken.\n\nMy tables are so crowded with gifts that I might set up a _petit\nDunkerque_ of my own, for not a single friend has omitted to send me a\npresent. These gifts are to be acknowledged by ones of similar value,\nand I must go and put my taste to the test in selecting _cadeaux_ to\nsend in return.\n\nSpent several hours yesterday in the gallery of the Louvre. The\ncollection of antiquities, though a very rich, one, dwindles into\ninsignificance when compared with that of the Vatican, and the halls in\nwhich it is arranged appear mean in the eyes of those accustomed to see\nthe numerous and splendid ones of the Roman edifice. Nevertheless, I\nfelt much satisfaction in lounging through groups of statues, and busts\nof the remarkable men and women of antiquity, with the countenances of\nmany of whom I had made myself familiar in the Vatican, the Musée of\nthe Capitol, or in the collection at Naples, where facsimiles of\nseveral of them are to be found.\n\nNor had I less pleasure in contemplating the personifications of the\n_beau idéal_ of the ancient sculptors, exhibited in their gods and\ngoddesses, in whose faultless faces the expression of all passion seems\nto have been carefully avoided. Whether this peculiarity is to be\naccounted for by the desire of the artist to signify the superiority of\nthe Pagan divinities over mortals, by this absence of any trace of\nearthly feelings, or whether it was thought that any decided expression\nmight deteriorate from the character of repose and beauty that marks\nthe works of the great sculptors of antiquity, I know not, but the\neffect produced on my mind by the contemplation of these calm and\nbeautiful faces, has something so soothing in it, that I can well\nimagine with what pleasure those engaged in the turmoils of war, or the\nscarcely less exciting arena of politics, in former ages, must have\nturned from their mundane cares to look on these personations of their\nfabled deities, whose tranquil beauty forms so soothing a contrast to\nmortal toils.\n\nI have observed this calmness of expression in the faces of many of the\nmost celebrated statues of antiquity, in the Aristides at Naples, I\nremember being struck with it, and noticing that he who was banished\nthrough the envy excited by his being styled the Just, was represented\nas unmoved as if the injustice of his countrymen no more affected the\neven tenour of his mind, than the passions of mortals disturb those of\nthe mythological divinities of the ancients.\n\nA long residence in Italy, and a habit of frequenting the galleries\ncontaining the finest works of art there, engender a love of sculpture\nand painting, that renders it not only a luxury but almost a necessary\nof life to pass some hours occasionally among the all but breathing\nmarbles and glorious pictures bequeathed to posterity by the mighty\nartists of old. I love to pass such hours alone, or in the society of\nsome one as partial, but more skilled in such studies than myself; and\nsuch a companion I have found in the Baron de Cailleux, an old\nacquaintance, and now Under-Director of the Musée, whose knowledge of\nthe fine arts equals his love for them.\n\nThe contemplation of the _chefs-d'uvre_ of the old masters begets a\ntender melancholy in the mind, that is not without a charm for those\naddicted to it. These stand the results of long lives devoted to the\ndevelopement of the genius that embodied these inspirations, and left\nto the world the fruit of hours of toil and seclusion,--hours snatched\nfrom the tempting pleasures that cease not to court the senses, but\nwhich they who laboured for posterity resisted. The long vigils, the\nsolitary days, the hopes and fears, the fears more frequent than the\nhopes, the depression of spirits, and the injustice or the indifference\nof contemporaries, endured by all who have ever devoted their lives to\nart, are present to my mind when I behold the great works of other\ntimes.\n\nWhat cheered these men of genius during their toils and enabled them to\nfinish their glorious works? Was it not the hope that from posterity\nthey would meet with the admiration, the sympathy, denied them by their\ncontemporaries?--as the prisoner in his gloomy dungeon, refused all\npity, seeks consolation by tracing a few lines on its dreary walls, in\nappeal to the sympathy of some future inhabitant who may be doomed to\ntake his place.\n\nI seem to be paying a portion of the debt due by posterity to those who\nlaboured long and painfully for it, when I stand rapt in admiration\nbefore the works of the great masters of the olden time, my heart\ntouched with a lively sympathy for their destinies; nor can I look on\nthe glorious faces or glowing landscapes that remain to us, evincing\nthe triumph of genius over even time itself, by preserving on canvass\nthe semblance of all that charmed in nature, without experiencing the\nsentiment so naturally and beautifully expressed in the celebrated\npicture, by Nicolas Poussin, of a touching scene in Arcadia, in which\nis a tomb near to which two shepherds are reading the inscription. \"I,\ntoo, was an Arcadian.\"\n\nYes, that which delighted the artists of old, they have transmitted to\nus with a tender confidence that when contemplating these bequests we\nwould remember with sympathy that they, like us, had felt the charms\nthey delineated.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n\nWent to see the Hôtel d'Orsay, to-day. Even in its ruin it still\nretains many of the vestiges of its former splendour. The _salle à\nmanger_, for the decoration of which its owner bought, and had conveyed\nfrom Rome, the columns of the Temple of Nero, is now--hear it, ye who\nhave taste!--converted into a stable; the _salons_, once filled with\nthe most precious works of art, are now crumbled to decay, and the vast\ngarden where bloomed the rarest exotics, and in which were several of\nthe statues that are now in the gardens of the Tuileries, is now turned\ninto paddocks for horses.\n\nIt made me sad to look at this scene of devastation, the result of a\nrevolution which plunged so many noble families from almost boundless\nwealth into comparative poverty, and scattered collections of the works\nof art that whole lives were passed in forming. I remember Mr.\nMillingen, the antiquary, telling me in Italy that when yet little more\nthan a boy he was taken to view the Hôtel d'Orsay, then one of the most\nmagnificent houses in Paris, and containing the finest collection of\npictures and statues, and that its splendour made such an impression on\nhis mind that he had never forgotten it.\n\nWith an admirable taste and a princely fortune, Count d'Orsay spared\nneither trouble nor expense to render his house the focus of all that\nwas rich and rare; and, with a spirit that does not always animate the\npossessor of rare works of art, he opened it to the young artists of\nthe day, who were permitted to study in its gallery and _salons_.\n\nIn the slate drawing-rooms a fanciful notion of the Count's was carried\ninto effect and was greatly admired, though, I believe, owing to the\ngreat expense, the mode was not adopted in other houses, namely, on the\nfolding-doors of the suite being thrown open to admit company, certain\npedals connected with them were put in motion, and a strain of music\nwas produced, which announced the presence of guests, and the doors of\neach of the drawing-rooms when opened took up the air, and continued it\nuntil closed.\n\nMany of the old _noblesse_ have been describing the splendour of the\nHôtel d'Orsay to me since I have been at Paris, and the Duc de\nTalleyrand said it almost realised the notion of a fairy palace. Could\nthe owner who expended such vast sums on its decoration, behold it in\nits present ruin, he could never recognise it; but such would be the\ncase with many a one whose stately palaces became the prey of a furious\nrabble, let loose to pillage by a revolution--that most fearful of all\ncalamities, pestilence only excepted, that can befall a country.\n\nGeneral Ornano, his stepson Count Waleski, M. Achille La Marre, General\nd'Orsay, and Mr. Francis Baring dined here yesterday. General Ornano is\nagreeable and well-mannered. We had music in the evening, and the\nlively and pretty Madame la H---- came. She is greatly admired, and no\nwonder; for she is not only handsome, but clever and piquant. Hers does\nnot appear to be a well-assorted marriage, for M. la H---- is grave, if\nnot austere, in his manners, while she is full of gaiety and vivacity,\nthe demonstrations of which seem to give him any thing but pleasure.\n\nI know not which is most to be pitied, a saturnine husband whose\ngravity is only increased by the gaiety of his wife, or the gay wife\nwhose exuberance of spirits finds no sympathy in the Mentor-like\nhusband. Half, if not all, the unhappy marriages, accounted for by\nincompatibility of humour, might with more correctness be attributed to\na total misunderstanding of each other's characters and dispositions in\nthe parties who drag a heavy and galling chain through life, the links\nof which might be rendered light and easy to be borne, if the wearers\ntook but half the pains to comprehend each other's peculiarities that\nthey in general do to reproach or to resent the annoyance these\npeculiarities occasion them.\n\nAn austere man would learn that the gaiety of his wife was as natural\nand excusable a peculiarity in her, as was his gravity in him, and\nconsequently would not resent it; and the lively wife would view the\nsaturnine humour of her husband as a malady demanding forbearance and\nkindness.\n\nThe indissolubility of marriage, so often urged as an additional cause\nfor aggravating the sense of annoyance experienced by those wedded but\nunsuited to each other, is, in my opinion, one of the strongest motives\nfor using every endeavour to render the union supportable, if not\nagreeable. If a dwelling known to be unalienable has some defect which\nmakes it unsuited to the taste of its owner, he either ameliorates it,\nor, if that be impracticable, he adopts the resolution of supporting\nits inconvenience with patience; so should a philosophical mind bear\nall that displeases in a union in which even the most fortunate find\n\"something to pity or forgive.\" It is unfortunate that this same\nphilosophy, considered so excellent a panacea for enabling us to bear\nills, should be so rarely used that people can seldom judge of its\nefficacy when required!\n\nSaw _la Gazza Ladra_ last night, in which Malibran enacted \"Ninetta,\"\nand added new laurels to the wreath accorded her by public opinion. Her\nsinging in the duo, in the prison scene, was one of the most touching\nperformances I ever heard; and her acting gave a fearful reality to the\npicture.\n\nI have been reading the _Calamities of Authors_ all the morning, and\nfind I like the book even better on a second perusal--no mean praise,\nfor the first greatly pleased me. So it is with all the works of Mr.\nD'Israeli, who writes _con amore_; and not only with a profound\nknowledge of his subjects, but with a deep sympathy, which peeps forth\nat every line, for the literary men whose troubles or peculiarities he\ndescribes.\n\nHis must be a fine nature--a contemplative mind imbued with a true love\nof literature, and a kindness of heart that melts and makes those of\nothers melt, for the evils to which its votaries are exposed.\n\nHow much are those who like reading, but are too idle for research,\nindebted to Mr. D'Israeli, who has given them the precious result of a\nlong life of study, so admirably digested and beautifully conveyed that\nin a few volumes are condensed a mass of the most valuable information!\nI never peruse a production of his without longing to be personally\nacquainted with him; and, though we never met, I entertain a regard and\nrespect for him, induced by the many pleasant hours his works have\nafforded me.\n\nMet the Princesse de Talleyrand last night at Madame C----'s. I felt\ncurious to see this lady, of whom I had heard such various reports;\nand, as usual, found her very different to the descriptions I had\nreceived.\n\nShe came _en princesse_, attended by two _dames de compagnie_, and a\ngentleman who acted as _chambellan_. Though her _embonpoint_ has not\nonly destroyed her shape but has also deteriorated her face, the small\nfeatures of which seem imbued in a mask much too fleshy for their\nproportions, it is easy to see that in her youth she must have been\nhandsome. Her complexion is fair; her hair, judging from the eye-brows\nand eye-lashes, must have been very light; her eyes are blue; her nose,\n_retroussé_; her mouth small, with full lips; and the expression of her\ncountenance is agreeable, though not intellectual.\n\nIn her demeanour there is an evident assumption of dignity, which,\nfalling short of the aim, gives an ungraceful stiffness to her\nappearance. Her dress was rich but suited to her age, which I should\npronounce to be about sixty. Her manner has the formality peculiar to\nthose conscious of occupying a higher station than their birth or\neducation entitles them to hold; and this consciousness gives an air of\nconstraint and reserve that curiously contrasts with the natural\ngood-humour and _naïveté_ that are frequently perceptible in her.\n\nIf ignorant--as is asserted--there is no symptom of it in her language.\nTo be sure, she says little; but that little is expressed with\npropriety: and if reserved, she is scrupulously polite. Her _dames de\ncompagnie_ and _chambellan_ treat her with profound respect, and she\nacknowledges their attentions with civility. To sum up all, the\nimpression made upon me by the Princesse Talleyrand was, that she\ndiffered in no way from any other princess I had ever met, except by a\ngreater degree of reserve and formality than were in general evinced by\nthem.\n\nI could not help smiling inwardly when looking at her, as I remembered\nBaron Denon's amusing story of the mistake she once made. When the\nBaron's work on Egypt was the topic of general conversation, and the\nhôtel of the Prince Talleyrand was the rendezvous of the most\ndistinguished persons of both sexes at Paris, Denon being engaged to\ndine there one day, the Prince wished the Princesse to read a few pages\nof the book, in order that she might be enabled to say something\ncomplimentary on it to the author. He consequently ordered his\nlibrarian to send the work to her apartment on the morning of the day\nof the dinner; but, unfortunately, at the same time also commanded that\na copy of _Robinson Crusoe_ should be sent to a young lady, a\n_protégée_ of hers, who resided in the hôtel. The Baron Denon's work,\nthrough mistake, was given to Mademoiselle, and _Robinson Crusoe_ was\ndelivered to the Princesse, who rapidly looked through its pages.\n\nThe seat of honour at table being assigned to the Baron, the Princesse,\nmindful of her husband's wishes, had no sooner eaten her soup than,\nsmiling graciously, she thanked Denon for the pleasure which the\nperusal of his work had afforded her. The author was pleased, and told\nher how much he felt honoured; but judge of his astonishment, and the\ndismay of the Prince Talleyrand, when the Princesse exclaimed. \"Yes,\nMonsieur le Baron, your work has delighted me; but I am longing to know\nwhat has become of your poor man Friday, about whom I feel such an\ninterest?\"\n\nDenon used to recount this anecdote with great spirit, confessing at\nthe same time that his _amour propre_ as an author had been for a\nmoment flattered by the commendation, even of a person universally\nknown to be incompetent to pronounce on the merit of his book. The\nEmperor Napoleon heard this story, and made Baron Denon repeat it to\nhim, laughing immoderately all the time, and frequently after he would,\nwhen he saw Denon, inquire \"how was poor Friday?\"\n\nWhen the second restoration of the Bourbons took place, the Prince\nTalleyrand, anxious to separate from the Princesse, and to get her out\nof his house, induced her, under the pretence that a change of air was\nabsolutely necessary for her health, to go to England for some months.\nShe had only been there a few weeks when a confidential friend at Paris\nwrote to inform her that from certain rumours afloat it was quite clear\nthe Prince did not intend her to take up her abode again in his house,\nand advised her to return without delay. The Princesse instantly\nadopted this counsel, and arrived most unexpectedly in the Rue\nSt.-Florentin, to the alarm and astonishment of the whole establishment\nthere, who had been taught not to look for her entering the hôtel any\nmore; and to the utter dismay of the Prince, who, however anxious to be\nseparated from her, dreaded a scene of violence still more than he\nwished to be released from his conjugal chains.\n\nShe forced her admission to his presence, overwhelmed him with\nreproaches, and it required the exercise of all his diplomatic skill to\nallay the storm he had raised. The affair became the general topic of\nconversation at Paris; and when, the day after the event, the Prince\nwaited on Louis the Eighteenth on affairs of state, the King, who loved\na joke, congratulated him on the unexpected arrival of Madame la\nPrincesse.\n\nPrince Talleyrand felt the sarcasm, and noticed it by one of those\nsmiles so peculiar to him--a shake of the head and shrug of the\nshoulders, while he uttered \"_Que voulez-vous, Sire, chacun a son vingt\nMars_?\" referring to the unexpected arrival of the Emperor Napoleon.\n\nI have been reading _Yes and No_, a very clever and, interesting novel\nfrom the pen of Lord Normanby. His writings evince great knowledge of\nthe world, the work-o'-day world, as well as the _beau monde_; yet\nthere is no bitterness in his satire, which is always just and happily\npointed. His style, too, is easy, fluent, and polished, without being\ndisfigured by the slightest affectation or pedantry.\n\nHad a long visit to-day from Dr. P----, who has lent me the works of\nBichat and Broussais, which he recommends me to read. He is a most\nagreeable companion, and as vivacious as if he was only twenty. He\nreminds me sometimes of my old friend Lady Dysart, whose juvenility of\nmind and manner always pleased as much as it surprised me.\n\nOld people like these appear to forget, as they are forgotten by, time;\nand, like trees marked to be cut down, but which escape the memory of\nthe marker, they continue to flourish though the lines traced for their\ndestruction are visible.\n\nThe more I see of Count Waleski the more I am pleased with him. He has\nan acute mind, great quickness of perception, and exceedingly good\nmanners. I always consider it a good sign of a young man to be partial\nto the society of the old, and I observe that Count Waleski evinces a\npreference for that of men old enough to be his father. People are not\ngenerally aware of the advantages which agreeable manners confer, and\nthe influence they exercise over society. I have seen great abilities\nfail in producing the effect accomplished by prepossessing manners,\nwhich are even more serviceable to their owner than is a fine\ncountenance, that best of all letters of recommendation.\n\nHalf the unpopularity of people proceeds from a disagreeable manner;\nand though we may be aware of the good qualities of persons who have\nthis defect, we cannot conceal from ourselves that it must always\noriginate in a want of the desire to please--a want, the evidence of\nwhich cannot fail to wound the self-love of those who detect, and\nindispose them towards those who betray it. By a disagreeable manner I\ndo not mean the awkwardness often arising from timidity, or the too\ngreat familiarity originating in untutored good nature: but I refer to\na superciliousness, or coldness, that marks a sense of superiority; or\nto a habit of contradiction, that renders society what it should never\nbe--an arena of debate.\n\nHow injudicious are those who defend their absent friends, when accused\nof having disagreeable manners, by saying, as I have often heard\npersons say--\"I assure you that he or she can be very agreeable with\nthose he or she likes:\" an assertion which, by implying that the person\naccused did not like those who complained of the bad manner, converts\nthem from simple disapprovers into something approaching to enemies.\n\nI had once occasion to notice the fine tact of a friend of mine, who,\nhearing a person he greatly esteemed censured for his disagreeable\nmanner, answered,\n\n     \"Yes, it is very true: with a thousand good qualities his\n     manner is very objectionable, even with those he likes best:\n     it is his misfortune, and he cannot help it; but those who\n     know him well will pardon it.\"\n\nThis candid admission of what could not be refuted, checked all further\ncensure at the moment, whereas an injudicious defence would have\nlengthened it; and I heard some of the individuals then present assert,\na few days subsequently, that Lord ---- was not, after all, by any\nmeans to be disliked: for that his manners were equally objectionable\neven with his most esteemed friends, and consequently meant nothing\nuncivil to strangers.\n\nI tried this soothing system the other day in defence of ----, when a\nwhole circle were attacking him for his rude habit of contradicting, by\nasserting, with a grave face, that he only contradicted those whose\ntalents he suspected, in order that he might draw them out in\ndiscussion.\n\n---- came in soon after, and it was positively amusing to observe how\nmuch better people bore his contradiction. Madame ---- only smiled\nwhen, having asserted that it was a remarkably fine day, he declared it\nto be abominable. The Duc de ---- looked gracious when, having repeated\nsome political news, ---- said he could prove the contrary to be the\nfact; and the Comtesse de ---- looked archly round when, having\nextravagantly praised a new novel, he pronounced that it was the worst\nof all the bad ones of the author.\n\n---- will become a popular man, and have to thank me for it. How angry\nwould he be if he knew the service I have rendered him, and how quickly\nwould he contradict all I said in his favour! ---- reminds me of the\nEnglishman of whom it was said, that so great was his love of\ncontradiction, that when the hour of the night and state of the weather\nwere announced by the watchman beneath his window, he used to get out\nof bed and raise both his casement and his voice to protest against the\naccuracy of the statement.\n\nRead _Pelham_; commenced it yesterday, and concluded it to-day. It is a\nnew style of novel, and, like all that is very clever, will lead to\nmany copyists. The writer possesses a felicitous fluency of language,\nprofound and just thoughts, and a knowledge of the world rarely\nacquired at his age, for I am told he is a very young man.\n\nThis work combines pointed and pungent satire on the follies of\nsociety, a deep vein of elevated sentiment, and a train of\nphilosophical thinking, seldom, if ever, allied to the tenderness which\npierces through the sentimental part. The opening reminded me of that\nof _Anastatius_, without being in the slightest degree an imitation;\nand many of the passages recalled Voltaire, by their wit and terseness.\n\nI, who don't like reading novels, heard so much in favour of this\none--for all Paris talk of it--that I broke through a resolution formed\nsince I read the dull book of ----, to read no more; and I am glad I\ndid so, for this clever book has greatly interested me.\n\nOh, the misery of having stupid books presented to one by the author!\n----, who is experienced in such matters, told me that the best plan in\nsuch cases was, to acknowledge the receipt of the book the same day it\narrived, and civilly express the pleasure anticipated from its perusal,\nby which means the necessity of praising a bad book was avoided. This\nsystem has, however, been so generally adopted of late, that authors\nare dissatisfied with it; and, consequently, a good-natured person\noften feels compelled to write commendations of books which he or she\nis far from approving; and which, though it costs an effort to write,\nare far from satisfying the _exigeant amour propre_ peculiar to\nauthors.\n\nI remember once being present when the merits of a book were canvassed.\nOne person declared it to be insufferably dull, when another, who had\npublished some novel, observed, with rather a supercilious air, \"You\nknow not how difficult it is to write a good book!\"\n\n\"I suppose it must be very difficult,\" was the answer, \"seeing how long\nand how often you have attempted, without succeeding.\"\n\nHow these letters of commendations of bad books, extorted from those to\nwhom the authors present them, will rise up in judgment against the\nwriters, when they are \"gone to that bourne whence no traveller\nreturns!\" I tremble to think of it! What severe animadversions on the\nbad taste, or the want of candour of the writers, and all because they\nwere too good-natured to give pain to the authors!\n\nWent to the Théâtre Italien last night, and saw Malibran in _la\nCenerentola_, in which her acting was no less admirable than her\nsinging. She sang \"Non più Mesta\" better than I ever heard it before,\nand astonished as well as delighted the audience. She has a soul and\nspirit in her style that carries away her hearers, as no other singer\ndoes, and excites an enthusiasm seldom, if ever, equalled. Malibran\nseems to be as little mistress of her own emotions when singing, as\nthose are whom her thrilling voice melts into softness, or wakes into\npassion. Every tone is pregnant with feeling, and every glance and\nattitude instinct with truthful emotion.\n\nA custom prevails in France, which is not practised in Italy, or in\nEngland, namely, _les lettres de faire part_, sent to announce deaths,\nmarriages, and births, to the circle of acquaintances of the parties.\nThis formality is never omitted, and these printed letters are sent out\nto all on the visiting lists, except relations, or very intimate\nfriends, to whom autograph letters are addressed.\n\nAnother custom also prevails, which is that of sending _bonbons_ to the\nfriends and acquaintance of the _accouchée_. These sweet proofs\n_d'amitié_ come pouring in frequently, and I confess I do not dislike\nthe usage.\n\nThe godfather always sends the _bonbons_ and a trinket to the mother of\nthe child, and also presents the godmother with a _corbeille_, in which\nare some dozens of gloves, two or three handsome fans, embroidered\npurses, a smelling-bottle, and a _vinaigrette_; and she offers him, _en\nrevanche_, a cane, buttons, or a pin--in short, some present. The\n_corbeilles_ given to godmothers are often very expensive, being suited\nto the rank of the parties; so that in Paris the compliment of being\nselected as a godfather entails no trifling expense on the chosen. The\ngreat prices given for wedding _trousseaux_ in France, even by those\nwho are not rich, surprise me, I confess.\n\nThey contain a superabundance of every article supposed to be necessary\nfor the toilette of a _nouvelle mariée_, from the rich robes of velvet\ndown to the simple _peignoir de matin_. Dresses of every description\nand material, and for all seasons, are found in it. Cloaks, furs,\nCashmere shawls, and all that is required for night or day use, are\nliberally supplied; indeed, so much so, that to see one of these\n_trousseaux_, one might imagine the person for whom it was intended was\ngoing to pass her life in some far-distant clime, where there would be\nno hope of finding similar articles, if ever wanted.\n\nThen comes the _corbeille de mariage_, well stored with the finest\nlaces, the most delicately embroidered pocket handkerchiefs, veils,\n_fichus, chemisettes_ and _canezous_, trinkets, smelling-bottles, fans,\n_vinaigrettes_, gloves, garters; and though last, not least, a purse\nwell filled to meet the wants or wishes of the bride,--a judicious\nattention never omitted.\n\nThese _trousseaux_ and _corbeilles_ are placed in a _salon_, and are\nexhibited to the friends the two or three days previously to the\nwedding; and the view of them often sends young maidens--ay, and\nelderly ones, too--away with an anxious desire to enter that holy state\nwhich ensures so many treasures. It is not fair to hold out such\ntemptations to the unmarried, and may be the cause why they are\ngenerally so desirous to quit the pale of single blessedness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\n\nCount Charles de Mornay dined here yesterday, _en famille_. How clever\nand amusing he is! Even in his liveliest sallies there is the evidence\nof a mind that can reflect deeply, as well as clothe its thoughts in\nthe happiest language. To be witty, yet thoroughly good-natured as he\nis, never exercising his wit at the expense of others, indicates no\nless kindness of heart than talent.\n\nI know few things more agreeable than to hear him and his cousin open\nthe armoury of their wit, which, like summer lightning, flashes rapidly\nand brightly, but never wounds. In England, we are apt to consider wit\nand satire as nearly synonymous; for we hear of the clever sayings of\nour reputed wits, in nine cases out of ten, allied to some ill-natured\n_bon mot_, or pointed epigram. In France this is not the case, for some\nof the most witty men, and women too, whom I ever knew, are as\nremarkable for their good nature as for their cleverness. That wit\nwhich needs not the spur of malice is certainly the best, and is most\nfrequently met with at Paris.\n\nWent last evening to see Mademoiselle Marsin _Henri III_. Her acting\nwas, as usual, inimitable. I was disappointed in the piece, of which I\nhad heard much praise. It is what the French call _décousue_, but is\ninteresting as a picture of the manners of the times which it\nrepresents. There is no want of action or bustle in it; on the\ncontrary, it abounds in incidents: but they are, for the most part,\npuerile. As in our own _Othello_, a pocket handkerchief leads to the\n_dénouement_, reminding one of the truth of the verse,--\n\n     \"What great events from trivial causes spring!\"\n\nThe whole court of Henry the Third are brought on the scene, and with\nan attention to costume to be found only in a Parisian theatre. The\nstrict attention to costume, and to all the other accessories\nappertaining to the epoch, _mise en scène_, is very advantageous to the\npieces brought out here; but, even should they fail to give or preserve\nan illusion, it is always highly interesting as offering a _tableau du\ncostume, et des moeurs des siècles passés_. The crowd brought on the\nstage in _Henri III_, though it adds to the splendour of the scenic\neffect, produces a confusion in the plot; as does also the vast number\nof names and titles introduced during the scenes, which fatigue the\nattention and defy the memory of the spectators.\n\nThe fierce \"Duc de Guise,\" the slave at once of two passions, generally\nconsidered to be the most incompatible, Love and Ambition, is made to\ncommit strange inconsistencies. \"Saïnt-Mégrin\" excites less interest\nthan he ought; but the \"Duchesse de Guise,\" whose beautiful arm plays a\n_grand rôle_, must, as played by Mademoiselle Mars, have conquered all\nhearts _vi et armis_.\n\n_Henri III_ has the most brilliant success, and, in despite of some\nfaults, is full of genius, and the language is vigorous. Perhaps its\nvery faults are to be attributed to an excess, rather than to a want,\nof power, and to a mind overflowing with a knowledge of the times he\nwished to represent; which led to a dilution of the strength of his\nscenes, by crowding into them too much extraneous matter.\n\nA curious incident occurred during the representation. Two\nladies--_gentlewomen_ they could not be correctly styled--being seated\nin the _balcon_, were brought in closer contact, whether by the crowd,\nor otherwise, than was agreeable to them. From remonstrances they\nproceeded to murmurs, not only \"loud, but deep,\" and from\nmurmurs--\"tell it not in Ascalon, publish it not in Gath\"--to violent\npushing, and, at length, to blows. The audience were, as well they\nmight be, shocked; the _Gendarmes_ interfered, and order was soon\nrestored. The extreme propriety of conduct that invariably prevails in\na Parisian audience, and more especially in the female portion of it,\nrenders the circumstance I have narrated remarkable.\n\nMet Lady G., Lady H., and the usual circle of _habitués_ last night at\nMadame C----'s. The first-mentioned lady surprises me every time I meet\nher, by the exaggeration of her sentiment and the romantic notions she\nentertains. Love, eternal love, is her favourite topic of conversation;\na topic unsuited to discussion at her age and in her position.\n\nTo hear a woman, no longer young, talking passionately of love, has\nsomething so absurd in it, that I am pained for Lady C., who is really\na kind-hearted and amiable woman. Her definitions of the passion, and\ndescriptions of its effects, remind me of the themes furnished by\nScudéry, and are as tiresome as the tales of a traveller recounted some\nfifty years after he has made his voyage. Lady H., who is older than\nLady G., opens wide her round eyes, laughs, and exclaims, \"Oh,\ndear!--how very strange!--well, that is so funny!\" until Lady C. draws\nup with all the dignity of a heroine of romance, and asserts that \"few,\nvery few, are capable of either feeling or comprehending the passion.\"\nA fortunate state for those who are no longer able to inspire it!\n\nTo grow old gracefully, proves no ordinary powers of mind, more\nespecially in one who has been (oh, what an odious phrase that same\n_has been_ is!) a beauty. Well has it been observed by a French writer,\nthat women no longer young and handsome should forget that they ever\nwere so.\n\nI have been reading Wordsworth's poems again, and I verily believe for\nthe fiftieth time. They contain a mine of lofty, beautiful, and natural\nthoughts. I never peruse them without feeling proud that England has\nsuch a poet, and without finding a love for the pure and the noble\nincreased in my mind. Talk of the ideal in poetry? what is it in\ncomparison with the positive and the natural, of which he gives such\nexquisite delineations, lifting his readers from Nature up to Nature's\nGod? How eloquently does he portray the feelings awakened by fine\nscenery, and the thoughts to which it gives birth!\n\nWordsworth is, _par excellence_, the Poet of Religion, for his\nproductions fill the mind with pure and holy aspirations. Fortunate is\nthe poet who has quaffed inspiration in the purest of all its sources,\nNature; and fortunate is the land that claims him for her own.\n\nThe influence exercised by courts over the habits of subjects, though\ncarried to a less extent in our days than in past times, is still\nobvious at Paris in the display of religion assumed by the upper class.\nCoroneted carriages are to be seen every day at the doors of certain\nchurches, which it is not very uncharitable to suppose might be less\nfrequently beheld there if the King, Madame la Dauphine, and the\nDauphin were less religious; and hands that have wielded a sword in\nmany a well-fought battle-field, and hold the _bâton de maréchal_ as a\nreward, may now be seen bearing a lighted _cierge_ in some pious\nprocession,--the military air of the intrepid warrior lost in the\nhumility of the devotee.\n\nThis general assumption of religion on the part of the courtiers\nreminds me forcibly of a passage in a poetical epistle, written, too,\nby a sovereign, who, unlike many monarchs, seemed to have had a due\nappreciation of the proneness of subjects to adopt the opinions of\ntheir rulers.\n\n     \"L'exemple d'un monarque ordonne et se fait suivre:\n     Quand Auguste buvait, la Pologne était ivre;\n     Et quand Louis le Grand brûlait d'un tendre amour,\n     Paris devint Cythère, et tout suivait sa cour;\n     Lorsqu'il devint dévot, ardent à la prière,\n     Ses lâches courtisans marmottaient leur bréviaire.\"\n\nShould the Duc de Bordeaux arrive at the throne while yet in the\nhey-day of youth, and with the gaiety that generally accompanies that\nperiod of life, it will be amusing to witness the metamorphosis that\nwill be effected in these same courtiers. There are doubtless many, and\nI am acquainted with some persons here, whose religion is as sincere\nand as fervent as is that of the royal personages of the court they\nfrequent; but I confess that I doubt whether the general mass of the\nupper class would _afficher_ their piety as much as they now do if\ntheir regular attendance at divine worship was less likely to be known\nat the Tuileries. The influence of a pious sovereign over the religious\nfeelings of his people must be highly beneficial when they feel,\ninstead of affecting to do so, the sanctity they profess.\n\nWhen those in the possession of supreme power, and all the advantages\nit is supposed to confer, turn from the enjoyment of them to seek\nsupport from Heaven to meet the doom allotted to kings as well as\nsubjects, the example is most salutary; for the piety of the rich and\ngreat is even more edifying than that of the poor and lowly, who are\nsupposed to seek consolation which the prosperous are imagined not to\nrequire.\n\nThe Duchesse de Berri is very popular at Paris, and deservedly so. Her\nnatural gaiety harmonises With that of this lively people; and her love\nof the fine arts, and the liberal patronage she extends to them,\ngratify the Parisians.\n\nI heard an anecdote of her to-day from an authority which leaves no\ndoubt of its truth. Having commanded a brilliant _fête_, a heavy fall\nof snow drew from one of her courtiers a remark that the extreme cold\nwould impede the pleasure of the guests, who would suffer from it in\ncoming and departing, \"True,\" replied the Duchesse; \"but if they in\ncomfortable carriages, and enveloped in furs and cashmeres, can suffer\nfrom the severity of the weather, what must the poor endure?\" And she\ninstantly ordered a large sum of money to be forthwith distributed, to\nsupply fuel to the indigent, saying--\"While I dance, I shall have the\npleasure of thinking the poor are not without the means of warmth.\"\n\nReceived a long and delightful letter from Walter Savage Landor. His is\none of the most original minds I have ever encountered, and is joined\nto one of the finest natures. Living in the delightful solitude he has\nchosen near Florence, his time is passed in reading, reflecting, and\nwriting; a life so blameless and so happy, that the philosophers of\nold, with whose thoughts his mind is so richly imbued, might, if envy\ncould enter into such hearts, entertain it towards him.\n\nLandor is a happy example of the effect of retirement on a great mind.\nFree from the interruptions which, if they harass not, at least impede\nthe continuous flow of thought in those who live much in society, his\nmind has developed itself boldly, and acquired a vigour at which,\nperhaps, it might never have arrived, had he been compelled to live in\na crowded city, chafed by the contact with minds of an inferior\ncalibre.\n\n_The Imaginary Conversations_ could never have been written amid the\nvexatious interruptions incidental to one mingling much in the scenes\nof busy life; for the voices of the sages of old with whom, beneath his\nown vines, Landor loves to commune, would have been inaudible in the\nturmoil of a populous town, and their secrets would not have been\nrevealed to him. The friction of society may animate the man of talent\ninto its exercise, but I am persuaded that solitude is essential to the\nperfect developement of genius.\n\nA letter from Sir William Gell, and, like all his letters, very\namusing. Yet how different from Landor's! Both written beneath the\nsunny sky of Italy, both scholars, and nearly of the same age,\nnevertheless, how widely different are their letters!\n\nGell's filled with lively and comic details of persons, seldom fail to\nmake me laugh; Landor's, wholly devoted to literary subjects, set me\nthinking. Cell would die of _ennui_ in the solitude Landor has\nselected; Landor would be chafed into irritation in the constant\nroutine of visiting and dining-out in which Gell finds amusement. But\nhere am I attempting to draw a parallel where none can be established,\nfor Landor is a man of genius, Gell a man of talent.\n\nWas at the Opera last night, and saw the Duc d'Orléans there with his\nfamily. They are a fine-looking flock, male and female, and looked as\nhappy as they are said to be.\n\nI know no position more enviable than that of the Duc d'Orléans.\nBlessed with health, a princely revenue, an admirable wife, fine\nchildren, and many friends, he can have nothing to desire but a\ncontinuance of these blessings. Having experienced adversity, and nobly\nendured the ordeal, he must feel with an increased zest the happiness\nnow accorded to him,--a happiness that seems so full and complete, that\nI can fancy no addition possible to it.\n\nHis vast wealth may enable him to exercise a generosity that even\nsovereigns can rarely practise; his exalted rank, while it places him\nnear a throne, precludes him from the eating cares that never fail to\nattend even the most solidly established one, and leaves him free to\nenjoy the happiness of domestic life in a family circle said to contain\nevery ingredient for creating it.\n\nThe fondest husband, father, and brother, he is fortunate beyond most\nmen in his domestic relations, and furnishes to France a bright example\nof irreproachable conduct and well-merited felicity in them all. In the\npossession of so many blessings, I should, were I in his position (and\nhe probably does, or he is not the sensible man I take him to be),\ntremble at the possibility of any event that could call him from the\ncalm enjoyment of them to the giddy height and uneasy seat of a throne.\n\nThe present king is in the vale of years, the Dauphin not young, and\nthe Duc de Bordeaux is but a child. Should any thing occur to this\nchild, then would the Duc d'Orléans stand in direct line after the\nDauphin. I thought of this contingency last night as I looked on the\nhappy family, and felt assured that were the Duc d'Orléans called to\nreign in France, these same faces would look less cloudless than they\ndid then, for I am one of those who believe that \"uneasy lies the head\nthat wears a crown.\"\n\nWith a good sense that characterises the Duc d'Orléans, he has sent his\nsons to public schools--a measure well calculated not only to give them\na just knowledge of the world, so often denied to princes, but to\nrender them popular. The Duc de Chartres is an exceedingly handsome\nyoung man, and his brothers are fine youths. The Princesses are brought\nup immediately under the eye of their mother, who is allowed by every\none to be a faultless model for her sex.\n\nThe Duc d'Orléans is said to be wholly engrossed in the future\nprospects of his children, and in insuring, as far as human foresight\ncan insure, their prosperity.\n\nI have been reading Shelley's works, in which I have found many\nbeautiful thoughts. This man of genius--for decidedly such he was--has\nnot yet been rendered justice to; the errors that shroud his poetry, as\nvapours rising from too rich a soil spread a mist that obstructs our\nview of the flowers that also spring from the same bed, have hindered\nus from appreciating the many beauties that abound in Shelley's\nwritings. Alarmed by the poison that lurks in some of his wild\nspeculations, we have slighted the antidote to be found in many others\nof them, and heaped obloquy on the fame of a poet whose genius and\nkindness of heart should have insured our pity for the errors of his\ncreed.\n\nHe who was all charity has found none in the judgment pronounced on him\nby his contemporaries; but posterity will be more just. The wild\ntheories and fanciful opinions of Shelley, on subjects too sacred to be\napproached lightly, carry with them their own condemnation; and so\npreclude the evil which pernicious doctrines, more logically reasoned,\nmight produce on weak minds. His theories are vague, dreamy, always\nerroneous, and often absurd: but the imagination of the poet, and the\ntenderness of heart of the man, plead for pardon for the false\ndoctrines of the would-be philosopher; and those who most admire his\npoetry will be the least disposed to tolerate his anti-religious\nprinciples. As a proof that his life was far from being in accordance\nwith his false creed, he enjoyed, up to his death, the friendship of\nsome of the most excellent men, who deplored his errors but who loved\nand valued him.\n\nWilliam Spencer, the poet, dined here yesterday. Alas! he has \"fallen\ninto the sere and yellow leaf,\" for though sometimes uttering brilliant\nthoughts, they are \"like angel visits, few and far between;\" and total\nsilence, or half-incoherent rhapsodies, mark the intervals.\n\nThis melancholy change is accounted for by the effects of an indulgence\nin wine, had recourse to in consequence of depression of spirits. Nor\nis this pernicious indulgence confined to the evening, for at a\n_déjeûner à la fourchette_ at two o'clock, enough wine is drunk to dull\nhis faculties for the rest of the day. What an unpoetical close to a\nlife once so brilliant!\n\nAlas, alas, for poor human nature! when, even though illumined by the\nethereal spark, it can thus sully its higher destiny. I thought of the\nmany fanciful and graceful poems so often perused with pleasure,\nwritten by Mr. Spencer amid the brilliant _fêtes_ in which he formerly\npassed his nights, and where he often found his inspirations. His was\never a courtly Muse, but without the hoop and train--a ball-room\n_belle_, with alternate smiles and sentimentality, and witty withal. No\nout-bursting of passion, or touch of deep pathos, interrupted the\nequanimity of feeling of those who perused Spencer's verses; yet was\ntheir absence unmissed, for the fancy, wit, and sentiment that marked\nthem all, and the graceful ease of the versification, rendered them\nprecisely what they were intended for,--_les vers de société_, the\nfitting volume elegantly bound to be placed in the _boudoir_.\n\nAnd there sat the pet poet of gilded _salons_, whose sparkling sallies\ncould once delight the fastidious circles in which he moved. His once\nbright eyes, glazed and lustreless, his cheeks sunken and pale, seeming\nonly conscious of the presence of those around him when offered\nchampagne, the excitement of which for a few brief moments produced\nsome flashing _bon mot à propos de rien_ passing at the time, after\nwhich his spirits subsided even more rapidly than did the bubbles of\nthe wine that had given them their short excitement.\n\nIt made me sad to contemplate this wreck; but most of those around him\nappeared unconscious of there being any thing remarkable in his\ndemeanour. They had not known him in his better days.\n\nI am often amused, and sometimes half-vexed by witnessing the\nprejudices that still exist in France with regard to the English. These\nprejudices prevail in all ranks, and are, I am disposed to think,\nincurable.\n\nThey extend to trivial, as well as to more grave matters, and influence\nthe opinions pronounced on all subjects. An example of this prejudice\noccurred a few weeks ago, when one of our most admired _belles_ from\nLondon having arrived at Paris, her personal appearance was much\ncanvassed. One person found her too tall, another discovered that she\nhad too much _embonpoint_, and a third said her feet were much too\nlarge. A Frenchman, when appealed to for his opinion, declared \"_Elle\nest très-bien pour une Anglaise_.\" I ought to add, that there was no\nEnglish person present when he made this ungallant speech, which was\nrepeated to me by a French lady, who laughed heartily at his notion.\n\nIf an Englishwoman enters a glover's, or shoemaker's shop, these\nworthies will only shew her the largest gloves or shoes they have in\ntheir _magasins_, so persuaded are they that she cannot have a small\nhand or foot; and when they find their wares too large, and are\ncompelled to search for the smallest size, they seem discomposed as\nwell as surprised, and inform the lady that they had no notion \"_une\ndame anglaise_ could want small gloves or shoes.\"\n\nThat an Englishwoman can be witty, or brilliant in conversation, the\nFrench either doubt or profess to doubt; but if convinced against their\nwill they exclaim, \"_C'est drôle, mais madame a l'esprit éminemment\nfrançais_.\" Now this no Englishwoman has, or, in my opinion, can have;\nfor it is peculiar, half-natural and half-acquired.\n\nConversation, in France, is an art successfully studied; to excel in\nwhich, not only much natural talent is required, but great fluency and\na happy choice of words are indispensable. No one in Parisian society\nspeaks ill, and many possess a readiness of wit, and a facility of\nturning it to account, that I have never seen exemplified in women of\nother countries.\n\nA Frenchwoman talks well on every subject, from those of the most grave\npolitical importance, to the _dernière mode_. Her talent in this art is\ndaily exercised, and consequently becomes perfected; while an\nEnglishwoman, with more various and solid attainments, rarely if ever,\narrives at the ease and self-confidence which would enable her to bring\nthe treasures with which her mind is stored into play. So generally is\nthe art of conversation cultivated in France, that even those with\nabilities that rise not beyond mediocrity can take their parts in it,\nnot only without exposing the poverty of their intellects, but with\neven a show of talent that often imposes on strangers.\n\nAn Englishwoman, more concentrated in her feelings as well as in her\npursuits, seldom devotes the time given by Frenchwomen to the\nsuperficial acquisition of a versatility of knowledge, which, though it\nenables _them_ to converse fluently on various subjects, _she_ would\ndread entering on, unless well versed in. My fair compatriots have\nconsequently fewer topics, even if they had equal talent, to converse\non; so that the _esprit_ styled, _par excellence, l'esprit éminemment\nfrançais_, is precisely that to which we can urge the fewest\npretensions.\n\nThis does not, however, dispose me to depreciate a talent, or art, for\nart it may be called, that renders society in France not only so\nbrilliant but so agreeable, and which is attended with the salutary\neffect of banishing the ill-natured observations and personal remarks\nwhich too often supply the place of more harmless topics with us.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n\nMuch as I deplore some of the consequences of the Revolution in France,\nand the atrocities by which it was stained, it is impossible not to\nadmit the great and salutary change effected in the habits and feelings\nof the people since that event. Who can live on terms of intimacy with\nthe French, without being struck by the difference between those of our\ntime, and those of whom we read previously to that epoch? The system of\neducation is totally different. The habits of domestic life are wholly\nchanged. The relations between husband and wife, and parents and\nchildren, have assumed another character, by which the bonds of\naffection and mutual dependances are drawn more closely together; and\n_home_, sweet _home_, the focus of domestic love, said to have been\nonce an unknown blessing, at least among the _haute noblesse_, is now\nendeared by the discharge of reciprocal duties and warm sympathies.\n\nIt is impossible to doubt but that the Revolution of 1789, and the\nterrible scenes in the reign of terror which followed it, operated in\nproducing the change to which I have referred. It found the greater\nportion of the _noblesse_ luxuriating in pleasure, and thinking only of\nselfish, if not of criminal indulgence, in pursuits equally marked by\npuerility and vice.\n\nThe corruption of the regency planted the seeds of vice in French\nmorals, and they yielded a plentiful harvest. How well has St.-Évremond\ndescribed that epoch in his playful, but sarcastic verses!--\n\n     \"Une politique indulgente,\n     De notre nature innocente,\n     Favorisait tous les désirs;\n     Tout goût paraissait légitime,\n     La douce erreur ne s'appelait point crime,\n     Les vices délicats se nommalent des plaisirs.\"\n\nBut it was reserved for the reign of Louis the Fifteenth to develope\nstill more extensively the corruption planted by his predecessor. The\ninfluence exercised on society by the baleful example of his court had\nnot yet ceased, and time had not been allowed for the reign of the mild\nmonarch who succeeded that gross voluptuary to work the reform in\nmanners, if not in morals, which his own personal habits were so well\ncalculated to produce. It required the terrible lesson given by the\nRevolution to awaken the natural feelings of affection that had so long\nslumbered supinely in the enervated hearts of the higher classes in\nFrance, corrupted by long habits of indulgence in selfish\ngratifications. The lesson at once awoke even the most callous; while\nthose, and there were many such, who required it not, furnished the\nnoblest examples of high courage and self-devotion to the objects dear\nto them.\n\nIn exile and in poverty, when all extraneous sources of consolation\nwere denied them, those who if still plunged in pleasure and splendour\nmight have remained insensible to the blessings of family ties, now\nturned to them with the yearning fondness with which a last comfort is\nclasped, and became sensible how little they had hitherto estimated\nthem.\n\nOnce awakened from their too long and torpid slumber, the hearts\npurified by affliction learned to appreciate the blessings still left\nthem, and from the fearful epoch of the Revolution a gradual change may\nbe traced in the habits and feelings of the French people. Terrible has\nbeen the expiation of their former errors, but admirable has been the\nresult; for nowhere can be now found more devoted parents, more dutiful\nchildren, or more attached relatives, than among the French _noblesse_.\n\nIf the lesson afforded by the Revolution to the upper class has been\nattended with a salutary effect, it has been scarcely less advantageous\nto the middle and lower; for it has taught them the dangers to be\napprehended from the state of anarchy that ever follows on the heels of\npopular convulsions, exposing even those who participated in them to\ninfinitely worse evils than those from which they hoped to escape by a\nsubversion of the legitimate government.\n\nThese reflections have been suggested by a description given to me, by\none who mixed much in Parisian society previously to the Revolution, of\nthe habits, modes, and usages of the _haute noblesse_ of that period,\nand who is deeply sensible of the present regeneration. This person,\nthan whom a more impartial recorder of the events of that epoch cannot\nbe found, assured me that the accounts given in the memoirs and\npublications of the state of society at that epoch were by no means\nexaggerated, and that the domestic habits and affections at present so\nuniversally cultivated in France were, if not unknown, at least\nneglected.\n\nMarried people looked not to each other for happiness, and sought the\naggrandizement, and not the felicity, of their children. The\nacquisition of wealth and splendour and the enjoyment of pleasure\noccupied their thoughts, and those parents who secured these advantages\nfor their offspring, however they might have neglected to instil\nsentiments of morality and religion into their minds, believed that\nthey had fully discharged their duty towards them. It was the want of\nnatural affection between parents and children that led to the cynical\nobservation uttered by a French philosopher of that day, who explained\nthe partiality of grandfathers and grandmothers towards their\ngrandchildren, by saying these last were the enemies of their\nenemies,--a reflection founded on the grossest selfishness.\n\nThe habit of judging persons and things superficially, is one of the\ndefects that most frequently strike me in the Parisians. This defect\narises not from a want of quickness of apprehension, but has its source\nin the vivacity peculiar to them, which precludes their bestowing\nsufficient time to form an accurate opinion on what they pronounce.\nProne to judge from the exterior, rather than to study the interior\nqualifications of those with whom they come in contact, the person who\nis perfectly well-dressed and well-mannered will be better received\nthan he who, however highly recommended for mental superiority or fine\nqualities, happens to be ill-dressed, or troubled with _mauvaise\nhonte_.\n\nA woman, if ever so handsome, who is not dressed _à la mode_, will be\npronounced plain in a Parisian _salon_; while a really plain woman\nwearing a robe made by Victorine and a cap by Herbault, will be\nconsidered _très-bien, ou au moins bien gentille_. The person who can\nconverse fluently on all the ordinary topics, though never uttering a\nsingle sentiment or opinion worth remembering, will be more highly\nthought of than the one who, with a mind abounding with knowledge, only\nspeaks to elicit or convey information. Talent, to be appreciated in\nFrance, must be--like the wares in its shops--fully displayed; the\nFrench give no credit for what is kept in reserve.\n\nI have been reading _Devereux_, and like it infinitely,--even more than\n_Pelham_, which I estimated very highly. There is more thought and\nreflection in it, and the sentiments bear the stamp of a profound and\nelevated mind. The novels of this writer produce a totally different\neffect on me to that exercised by the works of other authors; they\namuse less than they make me think. Other novels banish thought, and\ninterest me only in the fate of the actors; but these awaken a train of\nreflection that often withdraws me from the story, leaving me deeply\nimpressed with the truth, beauty, and originality of the thoughts with\nwhich every page is pregnant.\n\nAll in Paris are talking of the _esclandre_ of the late trial in\nLondon; and the comments made on it by the French prove how different\nare the views of morality taken by them and us.\n\nConversing with some ladies on this subject last night, they asserted\nthat the infrequency of elopements in France proved the superiority of\nmorals of the French, and that few examples ever occurred of a woman\nbeing so lost to virtue as to desert her children and abandon her home.\n\"But if she should have rendered herself unworthy of any longer being\nthe companion of her children, the partner of her home,\" asked one of\nthe circle, \"would it be more moral to remain under the roof she had\ndishonoured, and with the husband she had betrayed, than to fly, and so\nincur the penalty she had drawn on her head?\" They were of opinion that\nthe elopement was the most criminal part of the affair, and that Lady\n---- was less culpable than many other ladies, because she had not\nfled; and, consequently, that elopements proved a greater\ndemoralisation than the sinful _liaisons_ carried on without them.\n\nLady C---- endeavoured to prove that the flight frequently originated\nin a latent sense of honour and shame, which rendered the presence of\nthe deceived husband and innocent children insufferable to her whose\nindulgence of a guilty passion had caused her to forfeit her right to\nthe conjugal home; but they could not comprehend this, and persisted in\nthinking the woman who fled with her lover more guilty than her who\nremained under the roof of the husband she deceived.\n\nOne thing is quite clear, which is, that the woman who feels she dare\nnot meet her wronged husband and children, if she dishonours them, will\nbe more deterred from sin by the consciousness of the necessity of\nflight, which it imposes, than will be the one who sees no such\nnecessity, and who dreads not the penalty she may be tempted to incur.\n\nLady C---- maintained that elopements are not a fair criterion for\njudging of the morality of a country; for that she who sins and flies\nis less hardened in guilt than she who remains and deceives: and the\nexample is also less pernicious, as the one who has forfeited her place\nin society serves as a beacon to warn others; while she whose errors\nare known, yet still retains hers, is a dangerous instance of the\nindulgence afforded to hardened duplicity. It is not the horror of\nguilt, but the dread of its exposure, that operates on the generality\nof minds; and this is not always sufficient to deter from sin.\n\nLes Dames de B---- dined with us yesterday. They are very clever and\namusing, and, what is better, are excellent women. Their attachment to\neach other, and devotion to their nephew, are edifying; and he appears\nworthy of it. Left an orphan when yet an infant, these sisters adopted\ntheir nephew, and for his sake have refused many advantageous offers of\nmarriage, devoting themselves to forwarding his interests and insuring\nhim their inheritance. They have shared his studies, taken part in his\nsuccess, and entered into his pains and pleasures, made his friends\ntheirs, and theirs his; no wonder, then, that he loves them so fondly,\nand is never happier than with them, taking a lively interest in all\ntheir pursuits.\n\nThese good and warm-hearted women are accused of being enthusiasts, and\nromantic. People say that at their age it is odd, if not absurd, to\nindulge in such exaggerated notions of attachment; nay more, to give\nsuch disinterested proofs of it. They may well smile at such remarks,\nwhile conscious that their devotion to their nephew has not only\nsecured his happiness, but constitutes their own; and that the warmth\nof affection for which they are censured, cheers the winter of their\nlives and diffuses a comfort over their existence unknown to the\nselfish mortals who live only for self.\n\nThey talked to me last night of the happiness they anticipated in\nseeing their nephew married. \"He is so good, so excellent, that the\nperson he selects cannot fail to love him fondly,\" said La Chanoinesse;\n\"and we will love her so dearly for ensuring his happiness,\" added the\nother sister.\n\nWho could know these two estimable women, without acknowledging how\nharsh and unjust are often the sweeping censures pronounced on those\nwho are termed old maids?--a class in whose breasts the affections\ninstinct in woman, not being exercised by conjugal or maternal ties,\nexpand into some other channel; and, if denied some dear object on\nwhich to place them, expends them on the domestic animals with which,\nin default of more rational favourites, they surround themselves.\n\nLes Dames de B----, happier than many of the spinsters of their age,\nhave an estimable object to bestow their affections on; but those who\nare less fortunate should rather excite our pity than ridicule, for\nmany and severe must have been the trials of that heart which turns at\nlast, _dans le besoin d'aimer_, to the bird, dog, or cat, that renders\nsolitude less lonely.\n\nThe difference between servitude in England and in France often strikes\nme, and more especially when I hear the frequent complaints made by\nEnglish people of the insolence and familiarity of French servants.\nUnaccustomed to hear a servant reply to any censure passed on him, the\nEnglish are apt to consider his doing so as a want of respect or\nsubordination, though a French servant does not even dream that he is\nguilty of either when, according to the general habit of his class and\ncountry, he attempts an exculpation not always satisfactory to his\nemployer, however it may be to himself.\n\nA French master listens to the explanation patiently, or at least\nwithout any demonstration of anger, unless he finds it is not based on\ntruth, when he reprehends the servant in a manner that satisfies the\nlatter that all future attempts to avoid blame by misrepresentation\nwill be unavailing. French servants imagine that they have the right to\nexplain, and their employers do not deny it; consequently, when they\nchange a French for an English master, they continue the same tone and\nmanner to which they have been used, and are not a little surprised to\nfind themselves considered guilty of impertinence.\n\nA French master and mistress issue their orders to their domestics with\nmuch more familiarity than the English do; take a lively interest in\ntheir welfare and happiness; advise them about their private concerns;\ninquire into the cause of any depression of spirits, or symptom of ill\nhealth they may observe, and make themselves acquainted with the\ncircumstances of those in their establishment.\n\nThis system lessens the distance maintained between masters and\nservants, but does not really diminish the respect entertained by the\nlatter towards their employers, who generally find around them humble\nfriends, instead of, as with us, cold and calculating dependents, who\nrepay our _hauteur_ by a total indifference to our interests, and,\nwhile evincing all the external appearance of profound respect,\nentertain little of the true feeling of it to their masters.\n\nTreating our servants as if they were automatons created solely for our\nuse, and who, being paid a certain remuneration for their services,\nhave no claim on us for kindness or sympathy, is a system very\ninjurious to their morals and our own interests, and requires an\namelioration. But while I deprecate the tone of familiarity that so\nfrequently shocks the untravelled English in the treatment of French\nemployers to their servants, I should like to see more kindness of\nmanner shewn by the English to theirs. Nowhere are servants so well\npaid, clothed, fed, and lodged, as with us, and nowhere are they said\nto feel so little attachment to their masters; which can only be\naccounted for by the erroneous system to which I have referred.\n\n---- came to see me to-day. He talked politics, and I am afraid went\naway shocked at perceiving how little interest I took in them. I like\nnot political subjects in England, and avoid them whenever I can; but\nhere I feel very much about them, as the Irishman is said to have felt\nwhen told that the house he was living in was on fire, and he answered\n\"Sure, what's that to me!--I am only a lodger!\"\n\n---- told me that France is in a very dangerous state; the people\ndiscontented, etc. etc. So I have heard every time I have visited Paris\nfor the last ten years; and as to the people being discontented, when\nwere they otherwise I should like to know? Never, at least since I have\nbeen acquainted with them; and it will require a sovereign such as\nFrance has not yet known to satisfy a people so versatile and\nexcitable. Charles the Tenth is not popular. His religious turn, far\nfrom conciliating the respect or confidence of his subjects, tends only\nto awaken their suspicions of his being influenced by the Jesuits--a\nsuspicion fraught with evil, if not danger, to him.\n\nStrange to say, all admit that France has not been so prosperous for\nyears as at present. Its people are rapidly acquiring a love of\ncommerce, and the wealth that springs from it, which induces me to\nimagine that they would not be disposed to risk the advantages they\npossess by any measure likely to subvert the present state of things.\nNevertheless, more than one alarmist like ---- shake their heads and\nlook solemn, foretelling that affairs cannot long go on as they are.\n\nOf one thing I am convinced, and that is, that no sovereign, whatever\nmay be his merits, can long remain popular in France; and that no\nprosperity, however brilliant, can prevent the people from those\n_émeutes_ into which their excitable temperaments, rather than any real\ncause for discontent, hurry them. These _émeutes_, too, are less\ndangerous than we are led to think. They are safety-valves by which the\nexuberant spirits of the French people escape; and their national\nvanity, being satisfied with the display of their force, soon subside\ninto tranquillity, if not aroused into protracted violence by unwise\ndemonstrations of coercion.\n\nThe two eldest sons of the Duc and Duchesse de Guiche have entered the\nCollege of Ste.-Barbe. This is a great trial to their mother, from whom\nthey had never previously been separated a single day. Well might she\nbe proud of them, on hearing the just eulogiums pronounced on the\nprogress in their studies while under the paternal roof; for never did\nparents devote themselves more to the improvement of their children\nthan the Duc and Duchesse de Guiche have done, and never did children\noffer a fairer prospect of rewarding their parents than do theirs.\n\nIt would have furnished a fine subject for a painter to see this\nbeautiful woman, still in the zenith of her youth and charms, walking\nbetween these two noble boys, whose personal beauty is as remarkable as\nthat of their parents, as she accompanied them to the college. The\ngroup reminded me of Cornelia and her sons, for there was the same\nclassic _tournure_ of heads and profiles, and the same elevated\ncharacter of _spirituelle_ beauty, that painters and sculptors always\nbestow on the young Roman matron and the Gracchi.\n\nThe Duc seemed impressed with a sentiment almost amounting to solemnity\nas he conducted his sons to Ste.-Barbe. He thought, probably, of the\ndifference between their boyhood and his own, passed in a foreign land\nand in exile; while they, brought up in the bosom of a happy home, have\nnow left it for the first time. Well has he taught them to love the\nland of their birth, for even now their youthful hearts are filled with\npatriotic and chivalrous feelings!\n\nIt would be fortunate, indeed, for the King of France if he had many\nsuch men as the Duc de Guiche around him--men with enlightened minds,\nwho have profited by the lessons of adversity, and kept pace with the\nrapidly advancing knowledge of the times to which they belong.\n\nPainful, indeed, would be the position of this excellent man should any\ncircumstances occur that would place the royal family in jeopardy, for\nhe is too sensible not to be aware of the errors that might lead to\nsuch a crisis, and too loyal not to share the perils he could not ward\noff; though he will never be among those who would incur them, for no\none is more impressed with the necessity of justice and impartiality\nthan he is.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n\nThe approach of spring is already visible here, and right glad am I to\nwelcome its genial influence; for a Paris winter possesses in my\nopinion no superiority over a London one,--nay, though it would be\ndeemed by the French little less than a heresy to say so, is even more\ndamp and disagreeable.\n\nThe Seine has her fogs, as dense, raw, and chilling, as those of old\nFather Thames himself; and the river approximating closer to \"the gay\nresorts\" of the _beau monde_, they are more felt. The want of draining,\nand the vapours that stagnate over the turbid waters of the _ruisseaux_\nthat intersect the streets at Paris, add to the humidity of the\natmosphere; while the sewers in London convey away unseen and unfelt,\nif not always unsmelt, the rain which purifies, while it deluges, our\nstreets. Heaven defend me, however, from uttering this disadvantageous\ncomparison to Parisian cars, for the French are too fond of Paris not\nto be proud even of its _ruisseaux_, and incredulous of its fogs, and\nany censure on either would be ill received.\n\nThe gay butterflies when they first expand their varicoloured wings and\nfloat in air, seem not more joyous than the Parisians have been during\nthe last two days of sunshine. The Jardins des Tuileries are crowded\nwith well-dressed groups; the budding leaves have burst forth with that\ndelicate green peculiar to early spring; and the chirping of\ninnumerable birds, as they flit from tree to tree, announces the\napproach of the vernal season.\n\nParis is at no time so attractive, in my opinion, as in spring; and the\nverdure of the foliage during its infancy is so tender, yet bright,\nthat it looks far more beautiful than with us in our London squares or\nparks, where no sooner do the leaves open into life, than they become\nstained by the impurity of the atmosphere, which soon deposes its dingy\nparticles on them, \"making the green one\"--black.\n\nThe Boulevards were well stocked with flowers to-day, the\n_bouquetières_ having resumed their stalls; and many a pedestrian might\nbe seen bargaining for these fair and frail harbingers of rosy spring.\n\nHow exhilarating are the effects of this season on the spirits\ndepressed by the long and gloomy winter, and the frame rendered languid\nby the same cause! The heart begins to beat with more energetic\nmovement, the blood flows more briskly through the veins, and the\nspirit of hope is revivified in the human heart. This sympathy between\nawakening nature, on the earth, and on man, renders us more, that at\nany other period, fond of the country; for this is the season of\npromise; and we know that each coming day, for a certain time, will\nbestow some new beauty on all that is now budding forth, until glowing,\nlaughing summer has replaced the fitful smiles and tears of spring.\n\nAnd there are persons who tell me they experience nought of this\nelasticity of spirits at the approach of spring! How are such mortals\nto be pitied! Yet, perhaps, they are less so than we imagine, for the\nsame insensibility that prevents their being exhilarated, may preclude\nthem from the depression so peculiar to all who have lively feelings.\n\n\"I see nothing so very delightful in spring,\" said ---- to me,\nyesterday. \"_Au contraire_, I think it rather disagreeable, for the\nsunshine cheats one into the belief of warmth, and we go forth less\nwarmly clad in consequence, so return home chilled by the sharp cold\nair which always prevails at this season, and find, as never fails to\nbe the case, that our stupid servants have let out the fires, because,\ntruly, the sun was shining in the cold blue sky.\" ---- reminds me of\nthe man mentioned in Sterne's works, who, when his friend looking on a\nbeautiful prospect, compared a green field with a flock of\nsnowy-fleeced sheep on it, to a vast emerald studded with pearls,\nanswered that _he_ could see nothing in it but grass and mutton.\n\nLord B---- set out for London to-day, to vote on the Catholic question,\nwhich is to come on immediately. His going at this moment, when he is\nfar from well, is no little sacrifice of personal comfort; but never\ndid he consider self when a duty was to be performed. I wish the\nquestion was carried, and he safely back again. What would our\npolitical friends say if they knew how strongly I urged him not to go,\nbut to send his proxy to Lord Rosslyn? I would not have consented to\nhis departure, were it not that the Duke of Wellington takes such an\ninterest in the measure.\n\nHow times are changed! and how much is due to those statesmen who yield\nup their own convictions for the general good! There is no action in\nthe whole life of the Duke more glorious than his self-abnegation on\nthis occasion, nor is that of the Tory leader of the House of Commons\nless praiseworthy; yet how many attacks will both incur by this\nsacrifice of their opinions to expediency! for when were the actions of\npublic men judged free from the prejudices that discolour and distort\nall viewed through their medium? That which originates in the purest\npatriotism, will be termed an unworthy tergiversation; but the reward\nof these great and good men will be found in their own breasts. I am\n_triste_ and unsettled, so will try the effect of a drive in the Bois\nde Boulogne.\n\nI was forcibly reminded yesterday of the truth of an observation of a\nclever French writer, who says, that to judge the real merit of a cook,\none should sit down to table without the least feeling of appetite, as\nthe triumph of the culinary art was not to satisfy hunger but to excite\nit. Our new cook achieved this triumph yesterday, for he is so\ninimitable an artist, that the flavour of his _plats_ made even me,\nalbeit unused to the sensation of hunger, feel disposed to render\njustice to them. Monsieur Louis--for so he is named--has a great\nreputation in his art; and it is evident, even from the proof furnished\nof his _savoir-faire_ yesterday, that he merits it.\n\nIt is those only who have delicate appetites that can truly appreciate\nthe talent of a cook; for they who devour soon lose the power of\ntasting. No symptom of that terrible malady, well named by the\ningenious Grimod de la Reynière _remords d'estomac_, but vulgarly\ncalled indigestion, follows my unusual indulgence in _entrées_ and\n_entremets_, another delightful proof of the admirable skill of\nMonsieur Louis.\n\nThe English are apt to spoil French cooks by neglecting the _entrées_\nfor the _pièce de résistance_, and, when the cook discovers this, which\nhe is soon enabled to do by the slight breaches made in the first, and\nthe large one in the second, his _amour-propre_ becomes wounded, and he\nbegins to neglect his _entrées_. Be warned, then, by me, all ye who\nwish your cooks to retain their skill, and however your native tastes\nfor that English favourite dish denominated \"a plain joint\" may\nprevail, never fail to taste the _entrée_.\n\n_À propos_ of cooks, an amusing instance of the _amour-propre_ of a\nParisian cook was related to me by the gourmand Lord ----, the last\ntime we dined at his house. Wishing to have a particular sauce made\nwhich he had tasted in London, and for which he got the receipt, he\nexplained to his cook, an artist of great celebrity, how the component\nparts were to be amalgamated.\n\n\"How, mylord!\" exclaimed _Monsieur le cuisinier_; \"an English sauce! Is\nit possible your lordsip can taste any thing so barbarous? Why, years\nago, my lord, a profound French philosopher described the English as a\npeople who had a hundred religions, but only one sauce.\"\n\nMore anxious to get the desired sauce than to defend the taste of his\ncountry, or correct the impertinence of his cook, Lord ---- immediately\nsaid, \"On recollection, I find I made a mistake; the sauce I mean is _à\nla Hollandaise_, and not _à l'Anglaise_.\"\n\n_A la bonne heure_, my lord, _c'est autre chose_; and the sauce was\nforthwith made, and was served at table the day we dined with Lord\n----.\n\nAn anecdote is told of this same cook, which Lord ---- relates with\ngreat good humour. The cook of another English nobleman conversing with\nhim, said, \"My master is like yours--a great _gourmand_.\"\n\n\"Pardon me,\" replied the other; \"there is a vast difference between our\nmasters. Yours is simply a _gourmand_, mine is an epicure as well.\"\n\nThe Duc de Talleyrand, dining with us a few days ago, observed that to\ngive a perfect dinner, the Amphitryon should have a French cook for\nsoups, _entrées_ and _entremets_; an English _rôtisseur_, and an\nItalian _confiseur_, as without these, a dinner could not be faultless.\n\"But, alas!\" said he--and he sighed while he spoke it--\"the Revolution\nhas destroyed our means of keeping these artists; and we eat now to\nsupport nature, instead of, as formerly, when we ate because it was a\npleasure to eat.\" The good-natured Duc nevertheless seemed to eat his\ndinner as if he still continued to take a pleasure in the operation,\nand did ample justice to a certain _plat de cailles farcies_ which he\npronounced to be perfect.\n\nOur landlord, le Marquis de L----, has sent to offer us the refusal of\nour beautiful abode. The Duc de N---- has proposed to take it for\nfourteen on twenty-one years, at the same rent we pay (an extravagant\none, by the bye), and as we only took it for a year, we must eithor\nleave or hire it for fourteen or twenty-one years, which is out of the\nquestion.\n\nNothing can be more fair or honourable than the conduct of the Marquis\nde L----, for he laid before us the offer of the Duc de N----; but as\nwe do not intend to remain more than two or three years more in Paris,\nwe must leave this charming house, to our infinite regret, when the\nyear for which we have hired it expires. Gladly would we have engaged\nit for two, or even three years more, but this is now impossible; and\nwe shall have the trouble of again going the round of house-hunting.\n\nWhen I look on the suite of rooms in which I have passed such pleasant\ndays, I am filled with regret at the prospect of leaving them, but it\ncannot be helped, so it is useless to repine. We have two months to\nlook about us, and many friends who are occupied in assisting us in the\nsearch.\n\nA letter from Lord B----; better, but still ailing. He presided at the\nCovent Garden Theatrical Fund Dinner, at the request of the Duke of\nClarence. He writes me that he met there Lord F. Leveson Gower[5], who\nwas introduced to him by Mr. Charles Greville, and of whom he has\nconceived a very high opinion. Lord B---- partakes my belief in\nphysiognomy, but in this instance the impression formed from the\ncountenance is justified by the reputation of the individual, who is\nuniversally esteemed and respected.\n\nWent again to see the Hôtel Monaco, which Lord B---- writes me to close\nfor; but its gloomy and uncomfortable bed-rooms discourage me, _malgré_\nthe splendour of the _salons_, which are decidedly the finest I have\nseen at Paris, I will decide on nothing until Lord B----'s return.\n\nWent to the College of Ste.-Barbe to-day, with the Duchesse de Guiche,\nto see her sons. Great was their delight at the meeting. I thought they\nwould never have done embracing her; and I, too, was warmly welcomed by\nthese dear and affectionate boys, who kissed me again and again. They\nhave already won golden opinions at the college, by their rare aptitude\nin acquiring all that is taught them, and by their docility and manly\ncharacters.\n\nThe masters paid the Duchesse the highest compliments on the progress\nher sons had made previously to their entrance at Ste.-Barbe, and\ndeclared that they had never met any children so far advanced for their\nage. I shared the triumph of this admirable mother, whose fair cheeks\nglowed, and whose beautiful eyes sparkled, on hearing the eulogiums\npronounced on her boys. Her observation to me was, \"How pleased their\nfather will be!\"\n\nSte.-Barbe is a little world in itself, and a very different world to\nany I had previously seen. In it every thing smacks of learning, and\nevery body seems wholly engrossed by study.\n\nThe spirit of emulation animates all, and excites the youths into an\napplication so intense as to be often found injurious to health. The\nambition of surpassing all competitors in their studies operates so\npowerfully on the generality of the _élèves_, that the masters\nfrequently find it more necessary to moderate, than to urge the ardour\nof the pupils. A boy's reputation for abilities soon gets known, but he\nmust possess no ordinary ones to be able to distinguish himself in a\ncollege where every victory in erudition is sure to be achieved by a\nwell-contested battle.\n\nWe passed through the quarter of Paris known as the Pays Latin, the\naspect of which is singular, and is said to have been little changed\nduring the last century. The houses, chiefly occupied by literary men,\nlook quaint and picturesque. Every man one sees passing has the air of\nan author, not as authors now are, or at least as popular ones are,\nwell-clothed and prosperous-looking, but as authors were when genius\ncould not always command a good wardrobe, and walked forth in\nhabiliments more derogatory to the age in which it was neglected, than\nto the individual whose poverty compelled such attire.\n\nMen in rusty threadbare black, with books under the arm, and some with\nspectacles on nose, reading while they walked along, might be\nencountered at every step.\n\nThe women, too, in the Pays Latin, have a totally different aspect to\nthose of every other part of Paris. The desire to please, inherent in\nthe female breast, seems to have expired in them, for their dress\nbetrays a total neglect, and its fashion is that of some forty years\nago. Even the youthful are equally negligent, which indicates their\nconviction that the men they meet seldom notice them, proving the truth\nof the old saying, that women dress to please men.\n\nThe old, with locks of snow, who had grown into senility in this\nerudite quarter, still paced the same promenade which they had trodden\nfor many a year, habit having fixed them where hope once led their\nsteps. The middle-aged, too, might be seen with hair beginning to\nblanch from long hours devoted to the midnight lamp, and faces marked\nwith \"the pale cast of thought.\" Hope, though less sanguine in her\npromises, still lures them on, and they pass the venerable old,\nunconscious that they themselves are succeeding them in the same life\nof study, to be followed by the same results, privation, and solitude,\nuntil death closes the scene. And yet a life of study is, perhaps, the\none in which the privations compelled by poverty are the least felt to\nbe a hardship.\n\nStudy, like virtue, is its own exceeding great reward, for it engrosses\nas well as elevates the mind above the sense of the wants so acutely\nfelt by those who have no intellectual pursuits; and many a student has\nforgotten his own privations when reading the history of the great and\ngood who have been exposed to even still more trying ones. Days pass\nuncounted in such occupations. Youth fleets away, if not happily, at\nleast tranquilly, while thus employed; and maturity glides into age,\nand age drops into the grave, scarcely conscious of the gradations of\neach, owing to the mind having been filled with a continuous train of\nthought, engendered by study.\n\nI have been reading some French poems by Madame Amabel Tastu; and very\nbeautiful they are. A sweet and healthy tone of mind breathes through\nthem, and the pensiveness that characterises many of them, marks a\nreflecting spirit imbued with tenderness. There is great harmony, too,\nin the versification, as well as purity and elegance in the diction.\nHow much some works make us wish to know their authors, and _vice\nversâ_! I feel, while reading her poems, that I should like Madame\nAmabel Tastu; while other books, whose cleverness I admit, convince me\nI should not like the writers.\n\nA book must always resemble, more or less, its author. It is the mind,\nor at least a portion of it, of the individual; and, however\ncircumstances may operate on it, the natural quality must always\nprevail and peep forth in spite of every effort to conceal it.\n\nLiving much in society seldom fails to deteriorate the force and\noriginality of superior minds; because, though unconsciously, the\npersons who possess them are prone to fall into the habits of thought\nof those with whom they pass a considerable portion of their time, and\nsuffer themselves to degenerate into taking an interest in puerilities\non which, in the privacy of their study, they would not bestow a single\nthought. Hence, we are sometimes shocked at observing glaring\ninconsistencies in the works of writers, and find it difficult to\nimagine that the grave reflection which pervades some of the pages can\nemanate from the same mind that dictated the puerilities abounding in\nothers. The author's profound thoughts were his own, the puerilities\nwere the result of the friction of his mind with inferior ones: at\nleast this is my theory, and, as it is a charitable one, I like to\nindulge it.\n\nA pleasant party at dinner yesterday. Mr. W. Spencer, the poet, was\namong the guests, He was much more like the William Spencer of former\ndays than when he dined here before, and was occasionally brilliant,\nthough at intervals he relapsed into moodiness. He told some good\nstories of John Kemble, and told them well; but it seemed an effort to\nhim; and, while the listeners were still smiling at his excellent\nimitation of the great tragedian, he sank back in his chair with an air\nof utter abstraction.\n\nI looked at him, and almost shuddered at marking the \"change that had\ncome o'er the spirit of his dream;\" for whether the story touched a\nchord that awakened some painful reflection in his memory, or that the\ntelling it had exhausted him, I know not, but his countenance for some\nminutes assumed a careworn and haggard expression, and he then glanced\naround at the guests with an air of surprise, like one awakened from\nslumber.\n\nIt is astonishing how little people observe each other in society! This\ninattention, originating in a good breeding that proscribes personal\nobservation, has degenerated into something that approaches very nearly\nto total indifference, and I am persuaded that a man might die at table\nseated between two others without their being aware of it, until he\ndropped from his chair.\n\nCivilization has its disadvantages as well as its advantages, and I\nthink the consciousness that one might expire between one's neighbours\nat table without their noticing it, is hardly atoned for by knowing\nthat they will not stare one out of countenance. I often think, as I\nlook around at a large dinner-party, how few present have the slightest\nknowledge of what is passing in the minds of the others. The smile worn\non many a face may be assumed to conceal a sadness which those who feel\nit are but too well aware would meet with little sympathy, for one of\nthe effects of modern civilization is the disregard for the cares of\nothers, which it engenders.\n\nMadame de ---- once said to me, \"I never invite Monsieur de ----,\nbecause he looks unhappy, and as if he expected to be questioned as to\nthe cause.\" This _naïve_ confession of Madame de ---- is what few would\nmake, but the selfishness that dictated it is what society, _en masse_,\nfeels and acts up to.\n\nMonsieur de ----, talking of London last evening, told the Count ----\nto be on his guard not to be too civil to people when he got there. The\nCount ---- looked astonished, and inquired the reason for the advice.\n\"Merely to prevent your being suspected of having designs on the hearts\nof the women, or the purses of the men,\" replied Monsieur de ----; \"for\nno one can evince in London society the _empressement_ peculiar to\nwell-bred Frenchmen without being accused of some unworthy motive for\nit.\"\n\nI defended my countrymen against the sweeping censure of the cynical\nMonsieur de ----, who shook his head and declared that he spoke from\nobservation. He added, that persons more than usually polite are always\nsupposed to be poor in London, and that as this supposition was the\nmost injurious to their reception in good society, he always counselled\nhis friends, when about to visit it, to assume a _brusquerie_ of\nmanner, and a stinginess with regard to money, by which means they were\nsure to escape the suspicion of poverty; as in England a parsimonious\nexpenditure and bluntness are supposed to imply the possession of\nwealth.\n\nI ventured to say that I could now understand why it was that he passed\nfor being so rich in England--a _coup de patte_ that turned the laugh\nagainst him.\n\nMr. de ---- is a perfect cynic, and piques himself on saying what he\nthinks,--a habit more frequently adopted by those who think\ndisagreeable, than agreeable things.\n\nDined yesterday at Madame C----'s, and being Friday, had a _dîner\nmaigre_, than which I know no dinner more luxurious, provided that the\ncook is a perfect artist, and that the Amphitryon, as was the case in\nthis instance, objects not to expense.\n\nThe _soupes_ and _entrées_ left no room to regret the absence of flesh\nor poultry from their component parts, and the _relevés_, in the shape\nof a _brochet rôti_, and a _turbot à la hollandaise_ supplied the place\nof the usual _pièces de résistance_. But not only was the flavour of\nthe _entrées_ quite as good as if they were composed of meat or\npoultry, but the appearance offered the same variety, and the\n_côtelettes de poisson_ and _fricandeau d'esturgeon_ might have\ndeceived all but the profoundly learned in gastronomy,--they looked so\nexactly like lamb and veal.\n\nThe second course offered equally delicate substitutes for the usual\ndainties, and the most fastidious epicure might have been more than\nsatisfied with the _entremets_.\n\nThe bishops in France are said to have had the most luxurious dinners\nimaginable on what were erroneously styled fast-days; and their cooks\nhad such a reputation for their skill, that the having served _à\nMonseigneur d'Église_ was a passport to the kitchens of all lovers of\ngood eating. There are people so profane as to insinuate that the\nexcellence at which the cooks arrived in dressing _les dîners maigres_\nis one of the causes why Catholicism has continued to flourish; but\nthis, of course, must be looked on as a malicious hint of the enemies\nto that faith which thus proves itself less addicted to indulgence in\nthe flesh than are its decryers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n\nThe more I observe Lady C---- the more surprised I am at the romantic\nfeelings she still indulges, and the illusions under which she\nlabours;--yes _labours_ is the suitable word, for it can be nothing\nshort of laborious, at her age, to work oneself into the belief that\nlove is an indispensable requisite for life. Not the affection into\nwhich the love of one's youth subsides, but the wild, the ungovernable\npassion peculiar to the heroes and heroines of novels, and young ladies\nand gentlemen recently emancipated from boarding-schools and colleges.\n\nPoor Lady C----, with so many estimable qualities, what a pity it is\nshe should have this weakness! She maintained in our conversation\nyesterday that true love could never be extinguished in the heart, and\nthat even in age it burnt with the same fire as when first kindled. I\nquoted to her a passage from Le Brun, who says--\"L'amour peut\ns'éteindre sans doute dans le coeur d'un galant homme; mais combien de\ndédommagements n'a-t-il pas alors à offrir! L'estime, l'amitié, la\nconfiance, ne suffisent-elles pas aux glaces de la vieillesse?\" Lady\nC---- thinks not.\n\nTalking last night of ----, some one observed that \"it was disagreeable\nto have such a neighbour, as he did nothing but watch and interfere in\nthe concerns of others.\"\n\n\"Give me in preference such a man as le Comte ----,\" said Monsieur\n----, slily, \"who never bestows a thought but on self, and is too much\noccupied with that interesting subject to have time to meddle with the\naffairs of other people.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" observed Madame ----, gravely, believing him to be\nserious; \"it is much preferable.\"\n\n\"But surely,\" said I, determined to continue the mystification, \"you\nare unjustly severe in your animadversions on poor Monsieur ----. Does\nhe not prove himself a true philanthropist in devoting the time to the\naffairs of others that might be usefully occupied in attending to his\nown?\"\n\n\"You are quite right,\" said Mrs. ----; \"I never viewed his conduct in\nthis light before; and now that I understand it I really begin to like\nhim,--a thing I thought quite impossible before you convinced me of the\ngoodness of his motives.\"\n\nHow many Mrs. ----'s there are in the world, with minds ductile as wax,\nready to receive any impression one wishes to give them! Yet I\nreproached myself for assisting to hoax her, when I saw the smiles\nexcited by her credulity.\n\nMademoiselle Delphine Gay[6] is one of the agreeable proofs that genius\nis hereditary. I have been reading some productions of hers that\ngreatly pleased me. Her poetry is graceful, the thoughts are natural,\nand the versification is polished. She is a very youthful authoress,\nand a beauty as well as a _bel esprit_. Her mother's novels have\nbeguiled many an hour of mine that might otherwise have been weary, for\nthey have the rare advantage of displaying an equal knowledge of the\nworld with a lively sensibility.\n\nAll Frenchwomen write well. They possess the art of giving interest\neven to trifles, and have a natural eloquence _de plume_, as well as\n_de langue_, that renders the task an easy one. It is the custom in\nEngland to decry French novels, because the English unreasonably expect\nthat the literature of other countries should be judged by the same\ncriterion by which they examine their own, without making sufficient\nallowance for the different manners and habits of the nations. Without\narrogating to myself the pretension of a critic, I should be unjust if\nI did not acknowledge that I have perused many a French novel by modern\nauthors, from which I have derived interest and pleasure.\n\nThe French critics are not loath to display their acumen in reviewing\nthe works of their compatriots, for they not only analyze the demerits\nwith pungent causticity, but apply to them the severest of all tests,\nthat of ridicule; in the use of which dangerous weapon they excel.\n\nHouse-hunting the greater part of the day. Oh the weariness of such an\noccupation, and, above all, after having lived in so delightful a house\nas the one we inhabit! Many of our French friends have come and told us\nthat they had found hôtels exactly to suit us: and we have driven next\nday to see them, when lo and behold! these eligible mansions were\neither situated in some disagreeable _quartier_, or consisted of three\nfine _salons de réception_, with some half-dozen miserable dormitories,\nand a passage-room by way of _salle à manger_.\n\nThough Paris abounds with fine _hôtels entre cour et jardin_, they are\nseldom to be let; and those to be disposed of are generally divided\ninto suites of apartments, appropriated to different persons. One of\nthe hôtels recommended by a friend was on the Boulevards, with the\nprincipal rooms commanding a full view of that populous and noisy\nquarter of Paris. I should have gone mad in such a dwelling, for the\npossibility of reading, or almost of thinking, amidst such an\never-moving scene of bustle and din, would be out of the question.\n\nThe modern French do not seem to appreciate the comfort of quiet and\nseclusion in the position of their abodes, for they talk of the\nenlivening influence of a vicinity to these same Boulevards from which\nI shrink with alarm. It was not so in former days; witness the\ndelightful hôtels before alluded to, _entre cour et jardin_, in which\nthe inhabitants, although in the centre of Paris, might enjoy all the\nrepose peculiar to a house in the country. There is something, I am\ninclined to think, in the nature of the Parisians that enables them to\nsupport noise better than we can,--nay, not only to support, but even\nto like it.\n\nI received an edition of the works of L.E.L. yesterday from London. She\nis a charming poetess, full of imagination and fancy, dazzling one\nmoment by the brilliancy of her flights, and the next touching the\nheart by some stroke of pathos. How Byron would have admired her\ngenius, for it bears the stamp of being influenced no less by a\ngraceful and fertile fancy than by a deep sensibility, and the union of\nthe two gives a peculiar charm to her poems.\n\nDrove to the Bois de Boulogne to-day, with the Comtesse d'O----, I know\nno such brilliant talker as she is. No matter what may be the subject\nof conversation, her wit flashes brightly on all, and without the\nslightest appearance of effort or pretension. She speaks from a mind\noverflowing with general information, made available by a retentive\nmemory, a ready wit, and in exhaustible good spirits.\n\nLetters from dear Italy. Shall I ever see that delightful land again? A\nletter, too, from Mrs. Francis Hare, asking me to be civil to some\nEnglish friends of hers, who are come to Paris, which I shall certainly\nbe for her sake.\n\n_À propos_ of the English, it is amusing to witness the avidity with\nwhich many of them not only accept but court civilities abroad, and the\n_sang-froid_ with which they seem to forget them when they return home.\nI have as yet had no opportunity of judging personally on this point,\nbut I hear such tales on the subject as would justify caution, if one\nwas disposed to extend hospitality with any prospective view to\ngratitude for it, which we never have done, and never will do.\n\nMine is the philosophy of ----, who, when his extreme hospitality to\nhis countrymen was remarked on, answered, \"I can't eat all my good\ndinners alone, and if I am lucky enough to find now and then a pleasant\nguest, it repays me for the many dull ones invited.\" I expect no\ngratitude for our hospitality to our compatriots, and \"Blessed are they\nwho expect not, for they will not be disappointed.\"\n\nLongchamps has not equalled my expectations. It is a dull affair after\nall, resembling the drive in Hyde Park on a Sunday in May, the\npromenade in the Cacina at Florence, in the Corso at Rome, or the\nChaija at Naples, in all save the elegance of the dresses of the women,\nin which Longchamps has an immeasurable superiority.\n\nIt is at Longchamps that the Parisian spring fashions are first\nexhibited, and busy are the _modistes_ for many weeks previously in\nputting their powers of invention to the test, in order to bring out\nnovelties, facsimiles of which are, the ensuing week, forwarded to\nEngland, Italy, Germany, Holland, and Russia. The coachmakers,\nsaddlers, and horse-dealers, are also put in requisition for this\nepoch; and, though the exhibition is no longer comparable to what it\nwas in former times, when a luxurious extravagance not only in dress,\nbut in equipages, was displayed, some handsome and well-appointed\ncarriages are still to be seen. Among the most remarkable for good\ntaste, were those of the Princess Bagration, and Monsieur Schikler,\nwhose very handsome wife attracted more admiration than the elegant\nvehicle in which she was seated, or the fine steeds that drew it.\n\nThose who are disposed to question the beauty of French women, should\nhave been at Longchamps to-day, when their scepticism would certainly\nhave been vanquished, for I saw several women there whose beauty could\nadmit of no doubt even by the most fastidious critic of female charms.\nThe Duchesse de Guiche, however, bore off the bell from all\ncompetitors, and so the spectators who crowded the Champs-Elysées\nseemed to think. Of her may be said what Choissy stated of la Duchesse\nde la Vallière, she has \"_La grace plus belle encore que la beauté_.\"\nThe handsome Duchesse d'Istrie and countless other _beautés à la mode_\nwere present, and well sustained the reputation for beauty of the\nParisian ladies.\n\nThe men _caracoled_ between the carriages on their proud and prancing\nsteeds, followed by grooms, _à l'Anglaise_, in smart liveries, and the\npeople crowded the footpaths on each side of the drive, commenting\naloud on the equipages and their owners that passed before them.\n\nThe promenade at Longchamps, which takes place in the Holy Week, is\nsaid to owe its origin to a religious procession that went annually to\na church so called, whence it by degrees changed its character, and\nbecame a scene of gaiety, in which the most extravagant exhibitions of\nluxury were displayed.\n\nOne example, out of many, of this extravagance, is furnished by a\npublication of the epoch at which Longchamps was in its most palmy\nstate, when a certain Mademoiselle Duthé, whose means of indulging in\ninordinate expense were not solely derived from her ostensible\nprofession as one of the performers attached to the Opera, figured in\nthe promenade in a carriage of the most sumptuous kind, drawn by no\nless than six thorough-bred horses, the harness of which was of blue\nmorocco, studded with polished steel ornaments, which produced the most\ndazzling effect.\n\nThat our times are improved in respect, at least, to appearances, may\nbe fairly concluded from the fact that no example of a similar\nostentatious display of luxury is ever now exhibited by persons in the\nsame position as Mademoiselle Duthé; and that if the same folly that\nenabled her to indulge in such extravagance still prevails, a sense of\ndecency prevents all public display of wealth so acquired. Modern\nmorals censure not people so much for their vices as for the display of\nthem, as Aleibiades was blamed not for loving Nemea, but for allowing\nhimself to be painted reposing on her lap.\n\nFinished the perusal of _Cinq Mars_, by Count Alfred de Vigny. It is an\nadmirable production, and deeply interested me. The sentiments noble\nand elevated, without ever degenerating into aught approaching to\nbombast, and the pathos such as a manly heart might feel, without\nincurring the accusation of weakness. The author must be a man of fine\nfeelings, as well as of genius,--but were they ever distinct? I like to\nthink they cannot be, for my theory is, that the feelings are to genius\nwhat the chords are to a musical instrument--they must be touched to\nproduce effect.\n\nThe style of Count Alfred de Vigny merits the eulogium passed by Lord\nShaftesbury on that of an author in his time, of which he wrote, \"It is\nfree from that affected obscurity and laboured pomp of language aiming\nat a false sublime, with crowded simile and mixed metaphor (the\nhobby-horse and rattle of the Muses.\")\n\n---- dined with us yesterday, and, clever as I admit him to be, he\noften displeases me by his severe strictures on mankind. I told him\nthat he exposed himself to the suspicion of censuring it only because\nhe had studied a bad specimen of it (self) more attentively than the\ngood that fell in his way: a reproof that turned the current of his\nconversation into a more agreeable channel, though he did not seem to\nlike the hint.\n\nIt is the fashion for people now-a-days to affect this cynicism, and to\nexpend their wit at the expense of poor human nature, which is abused\n_en masse_ for the sins of those who abuse it from judging of all\nothers by self. How different is ----, who thinks so well of his\nspecies, that, like our English laws, he disbelieves the existence of\nguilt until it is absolutely proved,--a charity originating in a\nsuperior nature, and a judgment formed from an involuntary\nconsciousness of it!\n\n---- suspects evil on all sides, and passes his time in guarding\nagainst it. He dares not indulge friendship, because he doubts the\npossibility of its being disinterested, and feels no little\nself-complacency when the conduct of those with whom he comes in\ncontact justifies his suspicions. ----, on the contrary, if sometimes\ndeceived, feels no bitterness, because he believes that the instance\nmay be a solitary one, and finds consolation in those whose truth he\nhas yet had no room to question. His is the best philosophy, for though\nit cannot preclude occasional disappointment, it ensures much\nhappiness, as the indulgence of good feelings invariably does, and he\noften creates the good qualities he gives credit for, as few persons\nare so bad as not to wish to justify the favourable opinion entertained\nof them, as few are so good as to resist the demoralising influence of\nunfounded suspicions.\n\nA letter from Lord B----, announcing a majority of 105 on the bill of\nthe Catholic question. Lord Grey made an admirable speech, with a happy\nallusion to the fact of Lord Howard of Effingham, who commanded the\nEnglish fleet in the reign of Elizabeth, having, though a Roman\nCatholic, destroyed the Armada under the anointed banner of the Pope.\nWhat a triumphant refutation of the notion that Roman Catholics dared\nnot oppose the Pope! Lord B---- writes, that the brilliant and justly\nmerited eulogium pronounced by Lord Grey on the Duke of Wellington was\nrapturously received by the House. How honourable to both was the\npraise! I feel delighted that Lord Grey should have distinguished\nhimself on this occasion, for he is one of the friends in England whom\nI most esteem.\n\n---- dined here to-day. He reminds me of the larva, which is the first\nstate of animal existence in the caterpillar, for his appetite is\nvoracious, and, as a French naturalist states in describing that\ninsect, \"Tout est estomac dans un larve.\" ---- is of the opinion of\nAretæus, that the stomach is the great source of pleasurable\naffections, and that as Nature \"abhors a vacuum,\" the more filled it is\nthe better.\n\nDining is a serious affair with ----. Soup, fish, flesh, and fowl,\ndisappear from his plate with a rapidity that is really surprising; and\nwhile they are vanishing, not \"into empty air,\" but into the yawning\nabyss of his ravenous jaws, his eyes wander around, seeking what next\nthose same ravenous jaws may devour.\n\nOn beholding a person indulge in such gluttony, I feel a distaste to\neating, as a certain double-refined lady of my acquaintance declared\nthat witnessing the demonstrations of love between two persons of low\nand vulgar habits so disgusted her with the tender passion, that she\nwas sure she never could experience it herself.\n\nI have been reading _la Chronique du Temps de Charles IX_, by Prosper\nMérimée, and a most interesting and admirably written book it is. Full\nof stirring scenes and incidents, it contains the most graphic pictures\nof the manners of the time in which the story is placed, and the\ninterest progresses, never flagging from the commencement to the end.\nThis book will be greatly admired in England, where the romances of our\ngreat Northern Wizard have taught us to appreciate the peculiar merit\nin which this abounds. Sir Walter Scott will be one of the first to\nadmire and render justice to this excellent book, and to welcome into\nthe field of literature this highly gifted brother of the craft.\n\nThe French writers deserve justice from the English, for they\ninvariably treat the works of the latter with indulgence. Scott is not\nmore read or esteemed in his own country than here; and even the\nproductions of our young writers are more kindly treated than those of\ntheir own youthful aspirants for fame.\n\nFrench critics have much merit for this amenity, because the greater\nnumber of them possess a peculiar talent, for the exercise of their\ncritical acumen, which renders the indulgence of it, like that of the\npower of ridicule, very tempting. Among the most remarkable critics of\nthe day Jules Janin, who though yet little more than a youth, evinces\nsuch talent as a reviewer as to be the terror of mediocrity. His style\nis pungent and vigorous, his satire searching and biting, and his tact\nin pointing ridicule unfailing. He bids fair to take a most\ndistinguished place in his profession.\n\nSpent last evening in the Rue d'Anjou, where I met the usual circle and\n----. He bepraised every one that was named during the evening, and so\ninjudiciously, that it was palpable he knew little of those upon whom\nhe expended his eulogiums; nay, he lauded some whom he acknowledged he\nhad never seen, on the same principle that actuated the Romans of old\nwho, having deified every body they knew, erected at last an altar to\nthe unknown Gods, lest any should by chance be omitted.\n\nThis habit of indiscriminate praise is almost as faulty as that of\ngeneral censure, and is, in my opinion, more injurious to the praised\nthan the censure is to the abused, because people are prone to indulge\na greater degree of sympathy towards those attacked than towards those\nwho are commended. No one said \"Amen\" to the praises heaped on some\nreally deserving people by ----, but several put in a palliating\n\"_pourtant_\" to the ill-natured remarks made by ----, whose habit of\nabusing all who chance to be named is quite as remarkable as the\nother's habit of praising. I would prefer being attacked by ---- to\nbeing lauded by ----, for the extravagance of the eulogiums of the\nlatter would excite more ill-will towards me than the censures of the\nother, as the self-love of the listeners disposes them to feel more\nkindly to the one they can pity, than to the person they are disposed\nto envy.\n\nI never look at dear, good Madame C---, without thinking how soon we\nmay,--nay, we must lose her. At her very advanced age we cannot hope\nthat she will be long spared to us; yet her freshness of heart and\nwonderful vivacity of mind would almost cheat one into a hope of her\nlong continuing amongst us.\n\nShe drove out with me yesterday to the Bois de Boulogne, and, when\nremarking how verdant and beautiful all around was looking, exclaimed,\n\"Ah! why is no second spring allowed to us? I hear,\" continued she,\n\"people say they would not like to renew their youth, but I cannot\nbelieve them. There are times--would you believe it?--that I forget my\nage, and feel so young in imagination that I can scarcely bring myself\nto think this heart, which is still so youthful, can appertain to the\nsame frame to which is attached this faded and wrinkled face,\" and she\nraised her hand to her cheek. \"Ah! my dear friend, it is a sad, sad\nthing to mark this fearful change, and I never look in my mirror\nwithout being shocked. The feelings ought to change with the person,\nand the heart should become as insensible as the face becomes\nwithered.\"\n\n\"The change in the face is so gradual, too,\" continued Madame C----.\n\"We see ourselves after thirty-five, each day looking a little less\nwell (we are loath to think it ugly), and we attribute it not to the\ntrue cause, the approach of that enemy to beauty--age,--but to some\ntemporary indisposition, a bad night's rest, or an unbecoming cap. We\nthus go on cheating ourselves, but not cheating others, until some day\nwhen the light falls more clearly on our faces, and the fearful truth\nstands revealed. Wrinkles have usurped the place of dimples; horrid\nlines, traced by Time, have encircled the eyelids; the eyes, too, no\nlonger bright and pellucid, become dim; the lips dry and colourless,\nthe teeth yellow, and the cheeks pale and faded, as a dried rose-leaf\nlong pressed in a _hortus siccus_.\"\n\n\"Alas, alas! who can help thinking of all this when one sees the trees\nopening into their rich foliage, the earth putting forth its bright\nverdure, and the flowers budding into bloom, while we resemble the hoar\nand dreary winter, and scarcely retain a trace of the genial summer we\nonce knew.\"\n\nThis conversation suggested the following lines, which I wish I could\ntranslate into French verse to give to Madame C----:\n\n     GRAY HAIRS.\n\n     Snowy blossoms of the grave\n     That now o'er care-worn temples wave,\n     Oh! what change hath pass'd since ye\n     O'er youthful brows fell carelessly!\n     In silken curls of ebon hue\n     That with such wild luxuriance grew,\n     The raven's dark and glossy wing\n     A richer shadow scarce could fling.\n     The brow that tells a tale of Care\n     That Sorrow's pen hath written there,\n     In characters too deeply traced\n     Ever on earth to be effaced,\n     Was then a page of spotless white,\n     Where Love himself might wish to write.\n     The jetty arches that did rise,\n     As if to guard the brilliant eyes,\n     Have lost their smoothness;--and no more\n     The eyes can sparkle as of yore:\n     They look like fountains form'd by tears,\n     Where perish'd Hope in by-gone years.\n     The nose that served as bridge between\n     The brow and mouth--for Love, I ween,\n     To pass--hath lost its sculptured air.\n     For Time, the spoiler, hath been there.\n     The mouth--ah! where's the crimson dye\n     That youth and health did erst supply?\n     Are these pale lips that seldom smile,\n     The same that laugh'd, devoid of guile.\n     Shewing within their coral cell\n     The shining pearls that there did dwell,\n     But dwell no more? The pearls are fled,\n     And homely teeth are in their stead.\n     The cheeks have lost the blushing rose\n     That once their surface could disclose;\n     A dull, pale tint has spread around,\n     Where rose and lily erst were found.\n     The throat, and bust--but, ah! forbear,\n     Let's draw a veil for ever there;\n     Too fearful is 't to put in rhyme\n     The changes wrought by cruel Time,\n     The faithful mirror well reveals\n     The truth that flattery conceals;\n     The charms once boasted, now are flown,\n     But mind and heart are still thine own;\n     And thou canst see the wreck of years,\n     And ghost of beauty, without tears.\n     No outward change thy soul shouldst wring,\n     Oh! mourn but for the change within;\n     Grieve over bright illusions fled,\n     O'er fondly cherish'd hope, now dead,\n     O'er errors of the days of youth,\n     Ere wisdom taught the path of truth.\n     Then hail, ye blossoms of the grave,\n     That o'er the care-worn temples wave--\n     Sent to remind us of \"that bourn,\n     Whence traveller can ne'er return;\"\n     The harbingers of peace and rest,\n     Where only mortals can be blest.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\n\nRead Victor Hugo's _Dernier Jour d'un Condamné!_ It is powerfully\nwritten, and the author identifies his feelings so strongly with the\ncondemned, that he must, while writing the book, have experienced\nsimilar emotions to those which a person in the same terrible position\nwould have felt. Wonderful power of genius, that can thus excite\nsympathy for the erring and the wretched, and awaken attention to a\nsubject but too little thought of in our selfish times, namely, the\nexpediency of the abolition of capital punishment! A perusal of Victor\nHugo's graphic book will do more to lead men's minds to reflect on this\npoint than all the dull essays; or as dull speeches, that may be\nwritten or made on it.\n\nTalking of ---- to-day with ---- ----, she remarked that he had every\nsense but common sense, and made light of this deficiency. How\nfrequently do we hear people do this, as if the possession of talents\nor various fine qualities can atone for its absence! Common sense is\nnot only positively necessary to render talent available by directing\nits proper application, but is indispensable as a monitor to warn men\nagainst error. Without this guide the passions and feelings will be\never leading men astray, and even those with the best natural\ndispositions will fall into error.\n\nCommon sense is to the individual what the compass is to the\nmariner--it enables him to steer safely through the rocks, shoals, and\nwhirlpools that intersect his way. Were the lives of criminals\naccurately known, I am persuaded that it would be found that from a\nwant of common sense had proceeded their guilt; for a clear perception\nof crime would do more to check its perpetration, than the goodness of\nheart which is so frequently urged as a preventive against it.\n\nConscience is the only substitute for common sense, but even this will\nnot supply its place in all cases. Conscience will lead a man to repent\nor atone for crime, but common sense will preclude his committing it by\nenabling him to judge of the result. I frequently hear people say, \"So\nand so are very clever,\" or \"very cunning, and are well calculated to\nmake their way in the world.\" This opinion seems to me to be a severe\nsatire on the world, for as cunning can only appertain to a mean\nintellect, to which it serves as a poor substitute for sense, it argues\nill for the world to suppose it can be taken in by it.\n\nI never knew a sensible, or a good person, who was cunning; and I have\nknown so many weak and wicked ones who possessed this despicable\nquality, that I hold it in abhorrence, except in very young children,\nto whom Providence gives it before they arrive at good sense.\n\nWent a round of the curiosity shops on the Quai d'Orsay, and bought an\namber vase of rare beauty, said to have once belonged to the Empress\nJosephine. When I see the beautiful objects collected together in these\nshops, I often think of their probable histories, and of those to whom\nthey once belonged. Each seems to identify itself with the former\nowner, and conjures up in my mind a little romance.\n\nA vase of rock crystal, set in precious stones, seen today, could never\nhave belonged to aught but some beauty, for whom it was selected by an\nadoring lover or husband, ere yet the honeymoon had passed. A chased\ngold _étui_, enriched with oriental agates and brilliants, must have\nappertained to some _grande dame_, on whose table it rested in a\nrichly-decorated _salon_; and could it speak, what piquant disclosures\nmight it not make!\n\nThe fine old watch, around the dial of which sparkle diamonds, and on\nthe back the motto, executed in the same precious stones, \"_Vous me\nfaites oublier les heures_,\" once adorned the slender waist of some\ndainty dame,--a nuptial gift. The silvery sound of its bell often\nreminded her of the flight of Time, and her _caro sposo_ of the effects\nof it on his inconstant heart, long before her mirror told her of the\nravages of the tyrant. The _flacon_ so tastefully ornamented, has been\nheld to delicate nostrils when the megrim--that malady peculiar to\nrefined organisations and susceptible nerves--has assailed its fair\nowner; and the heart-shaped pincushion of crimson velvet, inclosed in\nits golden case and stuck with pins, has been likened by the giver to\nhis own heart, pierced by the darts of Love--a simile that probably\ndispleased not the fair creature to whom it was addressed.\n\nHere are the expensive and tasteful gifts, the _gages d'amour_, not\noften disinterested, as bright and beautiful as when they left the\nhands of the jeweller; but the givers and the receivers where are they?\nMouldered in the grave long, long years ago! Through how many hands may\nthese objects not have passed since Death snatched away the persons for\nwhom they were originally designed! And here they are in the ignoble\ncustody of some avaricious vender, who having obtained them at the sale\nof some departed amateur for less than half their first cost, now\nexpects to extort more than double.\n\nHe takes them up in his unwashed fingers, turns them--oh,\nprofanation!--round and round, in order to display their various\nmerits, descants on the delicacy of the workmanship, the sharpness of\nthe chiseling, the pure water of the brilliants, and the fine taste\ndisplayed in the form; tells a hundred lies about the sum he gave for\nthem, the offers he has refused, the persons to whom they once\nbelonged, and those who wish to purchase them!\n\nThe _flacon_ of some defunct prude is placed side by side with the\n_vinaigrette_ of some _jolie danseuse_ who was any thing but prudish.\nHow shocked would the original owner of the _flacon_ feel at the\nfriction! The fan of some _grande dame de la cour_ touches the\ndiamond-mounted _étui_ of the wife of some _financier_, who would have\ngiven half her diamonds to enter the circle in which she who once owned\nthis fan found more _ennui_ than amusement. The cane of a deceased\nphilosopher is in close contact with the golden-hilted sword of a\n_petit maître de l'ancien régime_, and the sparkling _tabatière_ of a\n_Marquis Musqué_, the partaker if not the cause of half his _succès\ndans le monde_, is placed by the _chapelet_ of a _religieuse de haute\nnaissance_, who often perhaps dropped a tear on the beads as she\ncounted them in saying her Ave Marias, when some unbidden thought of\nthe world she had resigned usurped the place of her aspirations for a\nbrighter and more enduring world.\n\n\"And so 't will be when I am gone,\" as Moore's beautiful song says; the\nrare and beautiful _bijouterie_ which I have collected with such pains,\nand looked on with such pleasure, will probably be scattered abroad,\nand find their resting places not in gilded _salons_, but in the dingy\ncoffers of the wily _brocanteur_, whose exorbitant demands will\npreclude their finding purchasers. Even these inanimate and puerile\nobjects have their moral, if people would but seek it; but what has\nnot, to a reflecting mind?--complained bitterly to-day, of having been\nattacked by an anonymous scribbler. I was surprised to see a man\naccounted clever and sensible, so much annoyed by what I consider so\nwholly beneath his notice. It requires only a knowledge of the world\nand a self-respect to enable one to treat such attacks with the\ncontempt they merit; and those who allow themselves to be mortified by\nthem must be deficient in these necessary qualifications for passing\nsmoothly through life.\n\nIt seems to me to indicate great weakness of mind, when a person\npermits his peace to be at the mercy of every anonymous scribbler who,\nactuated by envy or hatred (the invariable causes of such attacks),\nwrites a libel on him. If a person so attacked would but reflect that\nfew, if any, who have acquired celebrity, or have been favoured by\nfortune, have ever escaped similar assaults, he would be disposed to\nconsider them as the certain proofs of a merit, the general\nacknowledgment of which has excited the ire of the envious, thus\ndisplayed by the only mean within their reach--anonymous abuse.\nAnonymous assailants may be likened to the cuttle-fish, which employs\nthe inky secretions it forms as a means of tormenting its enemy and\nbaffling pursuit.\n\nI have been reading the poems of Mrs. Hemans, and exquisite they are.\nThey affect me like sacred music, and never fail to excite religious\nsentiments. England only could have produced this poetess, and peculiar\ncircumstances were necessary to the developement of her genius. The\nmusic of the versification harmonises well with the elevated character\nof the thoughts, which inspire the reader (at least such is their\neffect on me) with a pensive sentiment of resignation that is not\nwithout a deep charm to a mind that loves to withdraw itself from the\nturmoil and bustle incidental to a life passed in a gay and brilliant\ncapital.\n\nThe mind of this charming poetess must be like an Æolian harp, that\nevery sighing wind awakes to music, but to grave and chastened melody,\nthe full charm of which can only be truly appreciated by those who have\nsorrowed, and who look beyond this earth for repose. Well might Goëthe\nwrite,\n\n     \"Wo du das Genie erblickst\n     Erblickst du auch zugleich die martkrone\"[7]\n\nfor where is Genius to be found that has not been tried by suffering?\n\nMoore has beautifully said,\n\n     \"The hearths that are soonest awake to the flowers,\n     Are always the first to be pierced by the thorns;\"\n\nand so it is with poets: they feel intensely before they can make\nothers feel even superficially.\n\nAnd there are those who can talk lightly and irreverently of the\nsufferings from which spring such exquisite, such glorious music,\nunconscious that the fine organization and delicate susceptibility of\nthe minds of Genius which give such precious gifts to delight others,\nreceive deep wounds from weapons that could not make an incision on\nimpenetrable hearts like their own. Yes, the hearts of people of genius\nmay be said to resemble the American maple-trees, which must be pierced\nere they yield their honied treasures.\n\nIf Mrs. Hemans had been as happy as she deserved to be, it is probable\nthat she would never have written the exquisite poems I have been\nreading; for the fulness of content leaves no room for the sweet and\nbitter fancies engendered by an imagination that finds its Hippocrene\nin the fountain of Sorrow, whose source is in the heart, and can only\nflow when touched by the hand of Care.\n\nWell may England be proud of such poetesses as she can now boast!\nJohanna Baillie, the noble-minded and elevated; Miss Bowles, the pure,\nthe true; Miss Mitford, the gifted and the natural; and Mrs. Hemans and\nMiss Landon, though last not least in the galaxy of Genius, with\nimaginations as brilliant as their hearts are generous and tender. Who\ncan read the productions of these gifted women, without feeling a\nlively interest in their welfare, and a pride in belonging to the\ncountry that has given them birth?\n\nLord B---- arrived yesterday, and, Heaven be thanked! is in better\nhealth. He says the spring is three weeks more advanced at Paris than\nin London. He is delighted at the Catholic Question having been\ncarried; and trusts, as I do, that Ireland will derive the greatest\nbenefit from the measure. How few, with estates in a province where so\nstrong a prejudice is entertained against Roman Catholics as exists in\nthe north of Ireland, would have voted as Lord B---- has done; but,\nlike his father, Lord B---- never allows personal interest to interfere\nin the discharge of a duty! If there were many such landlords in\nIreland, prejudices, the bane of that country, would soon subside. Lord\nB---- came back laden with presents for me. Some of them are quite\nbeautiful, and would excite the envy of half my sex.\n\nReceived letters from good, dear Sir William Gell, and the no less dear\nand good Archbishop of Tarentum, both urging us to return to Italy to\nsee them, as they say, once more before they die. Receiving letters\nfrom absent friends who are dear to us, has almost as much of sadness\nas of pleasure in it; for although it is consolatory to know that they\nare in life, and are not unmindful of us, still a closely written sheet\nof paper is but a poor substitute for the animated conversation, the\ncordial grasp of the hand, and the kind glance of the eye; and we\nbecome more sensible of the distance that divides us when letters\nwritten many days ago arrive, and we remember with dread that, since\nthese very epistles were indited, the hands that traced them may be\nchilled by death. This fear, which recurs so often to the mind in all\ncases of absence from those dear to us, becomes still more vivid where\ninfirmity of health and advanced age render the probability of the loss\nof friends the greater.\n\nItaly--dear, beautiful Italy--with all its sunshine and attractions,\nwould not be the same delightful residence to me if I no longer found\nthere the friends who made my _séjour_ there so pleasant; and among\nthese the Archbishop and Sir William Gell stand prominent.\n\nGell writes me that some new and interesting discoveries have been made\nat Pompeii. Would that I could be transported there for a few days to\nsee them with him, as I have beheld so many before when we were present\nat several excavations together, and saw exposed to the light of day\nobjects that had been for two thousand years buried in darkness! There\nwas a thrilling feeling of interest awakened in the breast by the first\nview of these so-long-interred articles of use or ornament of a bygone\ngeneration, and on the spot where their owners perished. It was as\nthough the secrets of the grave were revealed; and that, to convince us\nof the perishable coil of which mortals are formed, it is given us to\nbehold how much more durable are the commonest utensils of daily use\nthan the frames of those who boast themselves lords of the creation.\nBut here am I moralizing, when I ought to be taking advantage of this\nglorious day by a promenade in the Bois de Boulogne, where I promised\nto conduct Madame d'O----; so _allons en voiture_.\n\nRead the _Disowned_, and like it exceedingly. It is full of beautiful\nthoughts, sparkling with wit, teeming with sentiment, and each and all\nof them based on immutable truths. The more I read of the works of this\nhighly gifted writer, the more am I delighted with them; for his\nphilosophy passes through the alembic of a mind glowing with noble and\ngenerous sentiments, of which it imbibes the hues.\n\nThe generality of readers pause not to reflect on the truth and beauty\nof the sentiments to be found in novels. They hurry on to the\n_dénoûment_; and a stirring incident, skilfully managed, which serves\nto develope the plot, finds more admirers than the noblest thoughts, or\nmost witty maxims. Yet as people who read nothing else, will read\nnovels, authors like Mr. Bulwer, whose minds are overflowing with\ngenius, are compelled to make fiction the vehicle for giving to the\npublic thoughts and opinions that are deserving of a higher grade of\nliterature.\n\nThe greater portion of novel readers, liking not to be detained from\nthe interest of the story by any extraneous matter, however admirable\nit may be, skip over the passages that most delight those who read to\nreflect, and not for mere amusement.\n\nI find myself continually pausing over the admirable and profound\nreflections of Mr. Bulwer, and almost regret that his writings do not\nmeet the public as the papers of the _Spectator_ did, when a single one\nof them was deemed as essential to the breakfast-table of all lovers of\nliterature as a morning journal is now to the lovers of news. The merit\nof the thoughts would be then duly appreciated, instead of being\nhastily passed over in the excitement of the story which they\nintersect.\n\nA long visit from ----, and, as usual, politics furnished the topic.\nHow I wish people would never talk politics to me! I have no vocation\nfor that abstruse science,--a science in which even those who devote\nall their time and talents to it, but rarely arrive at a proficiency.\nIn vain do I profess my ignorance and inability; people will not\nbelieve me, and think it necessary to enter into political discussions\nthat _ennuient_ me beyond expression.\n\nIf ---- is to be credited, Charles the Tenth and his government are so\nunpopular that his reign will not pass without some violent commotion.\nA fatality appears to attend this family, which, like the house of\nStuart, seems doomed never to conciliate the affections of the people.\nAnd yet, Charles the Tenth is said not to be disposed to tyrannical\nmeasures, neither is he without many good qualities. But the last of\nthe Stuart sovereigns also was naturally a humane and good man, yet he\nwas driven from his kingdom and his throne,--a proof that weakness of\nmind is, perhaps, of all faults in a monarch, the one most likely to\ncompromise the security of his dynasty.\n\nThe restoration of the Stuarts after Cromwell, was hailed with much\nmore enthusiasm in England than that of Louis the Eighteenth, after the\nabdication of the Emperor Napoleon. Yet that enthusiasm was no pledge\nthat the people would bear from the descendants of the ill-fated\nCharles the First--that most perfect of all gentlemen and meekest of\nChristians--what they deprived him of not only his kingdom but his life\nfor attempting.\n\nThe house of Bourbon, like that of Stuart, has had its tragedy,\noffering a fearful lesson to sovereigns and a terrific example to\nsubjects. It has had, also, its restoration; and, if report may be\ncredited, the parallel will not rest here: for there are those who\nassert that as James was supplanted on the throne of England by a\nrelative while yet the legitimate and unoffending heir lived, so will\nalso the place of Charles the Tenth be filled by one between whom and\nthe crown stand two legitimate barriers. Time will tell how far the\npredictions of ---- are just; but, _en attendant_, I never can believe\nthat ambition can so blind _one_ who possesses all that can render life\na scene of happiness to himself and of usefulness to others, to throw\naway a positive good for the uncertain and unquiet possession of a\ncrown, bestowed by hands that to confer the dangerous gift must have\nsubverted a monarchy.\n\nPandora's box contained not more evils than the crown of France would\ninflict on him on whose brow a revolution would place it. From that\nhour let him bid adieu to peaceful slumber, to domestic happiness, to\nwell-merited confidence and esteem, all of which are now his own.\nPopularity, never a stable possession in any country, is infinitely\nless so in France, where the vivacity of perception of the people leads\nthem to discover grave faults where only slight errors exist, and where\na natural inconstancy, love of change, and a reckless impatience under\naught that offends them, prompt them to hurl down from the pedestal the\nidol of yesterday to replace it by the idol of to-day.\n\nI hear so much good of the Duc and Duchesse d'O---- that I feel a\nlively interest in them, and heartily wish they may never be elevated\n(unless by the natural demise of the legitimate heirs) to the dangerous\nheight to which ---- and others assert they will ultimately ascend.\nEven in the contingency of a legitimate inheritance of the crown, the\nTuileries would offer a less peaceful couch to them than they find in\nthe blissful domestic circle at N----.\n\nA long visit from the Duc de T----. I never meet him without being\nreminded of the truth of an observation of a French writer, who\nsays--\"_On a vu des gens se passer d'esprit en sachant mêler la\npolitesse avec des manières nobles et élégantes_.\" The Duc de T----\npasses off perfectly well without _esprit_, the absence of which his\nnoble manners perfectly conceal; while ----, who is so very clever,\nmakes one continually conscious of his want of good breeding and _bon\nton_.\n\nFinished reading _Sayings and Doings_, by Mr. Theodore Hook. Every page\nteems with wit, humour, or pathos, and reveals a knowledge of the world\nunder all the various phases of the ever-moving scene that gives a\nlively interest to all he writes. This profound acquaintance with human\nlife, which stamps the impress of truth on every character portrayed by\nhis graphic pen, has not soured his feelings or produced that cynical\ndisposition so frequently engendered by it.\n\nMr. Hook is no misanthrope, and while he exposes the ridiculous with a\nrare wit and humour he evinces a natural and warm sympathy with the\ngood. He is a very original thinker and writer, hits off characters\nwith a facility and felicity that few authors possess, and makes them\ninvariably act in accordance with the peculiar characteristics with\nwhich he has endowed them. The _vraisemblance_ is never for a moment\nviolated, which makes the reader imagine he is perusing a true\nnarration instead of a fiction.\n\nHouse-hunting to-day. Went again over the Hôtel Monaco, but its\ndilapidated state somewhat alarms us. The suite of reception rooms are\nmagnificent, but the garden into which they open pleases me still more,\nfor it is vast and umbrageous. The line old hôtels in the Faubourg\nSt.-Germain, and this is one of the finest, give one a good idea of the\nsplendour of the _noblesse de l'ancien régime_. The number and\nspaciousness of the apartments, the richness of the decorations, though\nno longer retaining their pristine beauty, and above all, the terraces\nand gardens, have a grand effect.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\n\nHouse-hunting all the day with Lord B----. Went again over the Hôtel\nMonaco, and abandoned the project of hiring it. Saw one house newly\nbuilt and freshly and beautifully decorated, which I like, but Lord\nB---- does not think good enough. It is in the Rue de Matignon. It is\nso desirable to get into a mansion where every thing is new and in good\ntaste, which is the case with the one in question, that I hope Lord\nB---- will be satisfied with this.\n\nSat an hour with General d'O---- who has been unwell. Never was there\nsuch a nurse as his wife, and so he said. Illness almost loses its\nirksomeness when the sick chamber is cheered by one who is as kind as\nshe is clever. Madame d'O---- is glad we have not taken the Hôtel\nMonaco, for she resided in it a long time when it was occupied by her\nmother, and she thinks the sleeping-rooms are confined and gloomy.\n\n\"After serious consideration and mature deliberation,\" we have finally\ndecided on taking the house in the Rue de Matignon. It will be\nbeautiful when completed, but nevertheless not to be compared to the\nHôtel Ney. The _salons de réception_, are very good, and the\ndecorations are rich and handsome.\n\nThe large _salon_ is separated from the lesser by an immense plate of\nunsilvered glass, which admits of the fireplaces in each room (they are\n_vis-à-vis_) being seen, and has a very good effect. A door on each\nside this large plate of glass opens into the smaller _salon_. The\nportion of the house allotted to me will, when completed, be like fairy\nland. A _salon_, destined to contain my buhl cabinets, _porcelaine de\nSèvres_, and rare _bijouterie_, opens into a library by two\nglass-doors, and in the pier which divides them is a large mirror\nfilling up the entire space.\n\nIn the library, that opens on a terrace, which is to be covered with a\n_berceau_, and converted into a garden, are two mirrors, _vis-à-vis_ to\nthe two glass doors that communicate from the _salon_; so that on\nentering this last, the effect produced is exceedingly pretty. Another\nlarge mirror is placed at the end of the library, and reflects the\nterrace.\n\nWhen my books and various treasures are arranged in this suite I shall\nbe very comfortably lodged. My _chambre à coucher_, dressing-room, and\nboudoir, are spacious, and beautifully decorated. All this sounds well\nand looks well, too, yet we shall leave the Rue de Bourbon with regret,\nand Lord B---- now laments that we did not secure it for a long term.\n\nDrove in the Bois de Boulogne. A lovely day, which produced a very\nexhilarating effect on my spirits. I know not whether others experience\nthe same pleasurable sensations that I do on a fine day in spring, when\nall nature is bursting into life, and the air and earth look joyous. My\nfeelings become more buoyant, my step more elastic, and all that I love\nseem dearer than before. I remember that even in childhood I was\npeculiarly sensible to atmospheric influence, and I find that as I grow\nold this susceptibility does not diminish.\n\nWe dined at the Rocher de Cancale yesterday; and Counts Septeuil and\nValeski composed our party. The Rocher de Cancale is the Greenwich of\nParis; the oysters and various other kinds of fish served up _con\ngusto_, attracting people to it, as the white bait draw visitors to\nGreenwich. Our dinner was excellent, and our party very agreeable.\n\nA _dîner de restaurant_ is pleasant from its novelty. The guests seem\nless ceremonious and more gay; the absence of the elegance that marks\nthe dinner-table appointments in a _maison bien montée_, gives a\nhomeliness and heartiness to the repast; and even the attendance of two\nor three ill-dressed _garçons_ hurrying about, instead of half-a-dozen\nsedate servants in rich liveries, marshalled by a solemn-looking\n_maître-d'hôtel_ and groom of the chambers, gives a zest to the dinner\noften wanted in more luxurious feasts.\n\nThe Bois de Boulogne yesterday presented one of the gayest sights\nimaginable as we drove through it, for, being Sunday, all the\n_bourgeoisie_ of Paris were promenading there, and in their holyday\ndresses. And very pretty and becoming were the said dresses, from those\nof the _femmes de négociants_, composed of rich and tasteful materials,\ndown to those of the humble _grisettes_, who, with jaunty air and\nroguish eyes, walked briskly along, casting glances at every smart\ntoilette they encountered, more intent on examining the dresses than\nthe wearers.\n\nA good taste in dress seems innate in Frenchwomen of every class, and a\nconfidence in their own attractions precludes the air of _mauvaise\nhonte_ and _gaucherie_ so continually observable in the women of other\ncountries, while it is so distinct from boldness that it never offends.\nIt was pretty to see the gay dresses of varied colours fluttering\nbeneath the delicate green foliage, like rich flowers agitated by a\nmore than usually brisk summer's wind, while the foliage and the\ndresses are still in their pristine purity.\n\nThe _beau monde_ occupied the drive in the centre, their vehicles of\nevery description attracting the admiration of the pedestrians, who\nglanced from the well-appointed carriages, whose owners reclined\nnegligently back as if unwilling to be seen, to the smart young\nequestrians on prancing steeds, who caracoled past with the air half\ndandy and half _militaire_ that characterises every young Frenchman.\n\nI am always struck in a crowd in Paris with the soldier-like air of its\nmale population; and this air does not seem to be the result of study,\nbut sits as naturally on them as does the look, half fierce, half\nmocking, that accompanies it. There is something in the nature of a\nFrenchman that enables him to become a soldier in less time than is\nusually necessary to render the natives of other countries _au fait_ in\nthe routine of duty, just as he learns to dance well in a quarter of\nthe time required to teach them to go through a simple measure.\n\nThe Emperor Napoleon quickly observed this peculiar predisposition to a\nmilitary life in his subjects, and took advantage of it to fool them to\nthe top of their bent. The victories achieved beneath his banner\nreflect scarcely less honour on them than on him, and the memory of\nthem associates his name in their hearts by the strongest bonds of\nsympathy that can bind a Frenchman--the love of glory. A sense of duty,\nhigh discipline, and true courage, influence our soldiers in the\ndischarge of their calling. They are proud of their country and of\ntheir regiment, for the honour of which they are ready to fight unto\nthe death; but a Frenchman, though proud of his country and his\nregiment, is still more proud of his individual self, and, believing\nthat all eyes are upon _him_ acts as if his single arm could accomplish\nthat which only soldiers _en masse_ can achieve.\n\nA pleasant party at dinner at home yesterday. The Marquis de Mornay,\nCount Valeski, and General Ornano, were among the number. Laughed\nimmoderately at the _naïveté_ of ----, who is irresistibly ludicrous.\n\nMadame ---- came in the evening and sang \"God save the King.\" Time was\nthat her singing this national anthem would have electrified the\nhearers, but now--. Alas! alas! that voices, like faces, should lose\ntheir delicate flexibility and freshness, and seem but like the faint\necho of their former brilliant tones!\n\nDoes the ear of a singer, like the eye of some _has-been_ beauty, lose\nits fine perception and become accustomed to the change in the voice,\nas does the eye to that in the face, to which it appertains, from being\ndaily in the habit of seeing the said face! Merciful dispensation of\nProvidence, which thus saves us from the horror and dismay we must\nexperience could we but behold ourselves as others see us, after a\nlapse of years without having met; while we, unconscious of the sad\nchange in ourselves, are perfectly sensible of it in them. Oh, the\nmisery of the _mezzo termine_ in the journey of life, when time robs\nthe eyes of their lustre, the cheeks of their roses, the mouth of its\npearls, and the heart of its gaiety, and writes harsh sentences on\nbrows once smooth and polished as marble!\n\n     Well a-day! ah, well a-day!\n     Why fleets youth so fast away,\n     Taking beauty in its train,\n     Never to return again?\n\n     Well a-day! ah, well a-day!\n     Why will health no longer stay?\n     After youth 't will not remain,\n     Chased away by care and pain.\n\n     Well a-day! ah, well a-day!\n     Youth, health, beauty, gone for aye,\n     Life itself must quickly wane\n     With its thoughts and wishes vain.\n\n     Well a-day! ah, well a-day!\n     Frail and perishable clay\n     That to earth our wishes chain,\n     Well it is that brief's thy reign.\n\nI have been reading Captain Marryat's _Naval Officer_, and think it\nexceedingly clever and amusing. It is like himself, full of talent,\noriginality, and humour. He is an accurate observer of life; nothing\nescapes him; yet there is no bitterness in his satire and no\nexaggeration in his comic vein. He is never obliged to explain to his\nreaders _why_ the characters he introduces act in such or such a\nmanner.\n\nThey always bear out the parts he wishes them to enact, and the whole\nstory goes on so naturally that one feels as if reading a narrative of\nfacts, instead of a work of fiction.\n\nI have known Captain Marryat many years, and liked him from the first;\nbut this circumstance, far from rendering me more indulgent to his\nnovel, makes me more fastidious; for I find myself at all times more\ndisposed to criticise the writings of persons whom I know and like than\nthose of strangers: perhaps because I expect more from them, if, as in\nthe present case, I know them to be very clever.\n\nDined yesterday at the Cadran Bleu, and went in the evening to see _La\nTour d'Auvergne_, a piece founded on the life, and taking its name from\na soldier of the time of the Republic. A nobler character than that of\nLa Tour d'Auvergne could not be selected for a dramatic hero, and\nancient times furnish posterity with no brighter example. A letter from\nCarnot, then Minister of War, addressed to this distinguished soldier\nand admirable man, has pleased me so much that I give its substance:\n\n     \"On fixing my attention on the men who reflect honour on the\n     army, I have remarked you, citizen, and I said to the First\n     Consul--'La Tour d'Auvergne Corret, descendant of the family\n     of Turenne, has inherited its bravery and its virtues. One of\n     the oldest officers in the army, he counts the greatest\n     number of brilliant actions, and all the brave name him to be\n     the most brave. As modest as he is intrepid, he has shewn\n     himself anxious for glory alone, and has refused all the\n     grades offered to him. At the eastern Pyrénées the General\n     assembled all the companies of the grenadiers, and during the\n     remainder of the campaign gave them no chief. The oldest\n     captain was to command them, and he was Latour d'Auvergne. He\n     obeyed, and the corps was soon named by the enemy the\n     Infernal Column.\n\n     \"'One of his friends had an only son, whose labour was\n     necessary for the support of his father, and this young man\n     was included in the conscription. Latour d'Auvergne, broken\n     down by fatigue, could not labour, but he could still fight.\n     He hastened to the army of the Rhine; replaced the son of his\n     friend; and, during two campaigns, with his knapsack on his\n     hack and always in the foremost rank, he was in every\n     engagement, animating the grenadiers by his discourse and by\n     his example. Poor, but proud, he has refused the gift of an\n     estate offered to him by the head of his family. Simple in\n     his manners, and temperate in his habits, he lives on the\n     limited pay of a captain. Highly informed, and speaking\n     several languages, his erudition equals his courage. We are\n     indebted to his pen for the interesting work entitled _Les\n     Origines Gauloises_. Such rare talents and virtues appertain\n     to the page of history, but to the First Consul belongs the\n     right to anticipate its award.'\n\n     \"The First Consul, citizen, heard this recital with the same\n     emotions that I experienced. He named you instantly first\n     grenadier of the Republic, and decreed you this sword of\n     honour. _Salut et fraternité_.\"\n\nThe distinction accorded so readily to Latour d'Auvergne by the First\nConsul, himself a hero, who could better than any other contemporary\namong his countrymen appreciate the glory he was called on by Carnot to\nreward, was refused by the gallant veteran.\n\n\"Among us soldiers,\" said he, \"there is neither first nor last.\" He\ndemanded, as the sole recompense of his services, to be sent to join\nhis old brothers-in-arms, to fight once more with them, not as the\n_first_, but as the _oldest_, soldier of the Republic.\n\nHis death was like his life, glorious; for he fell on the field of\nbattle at Neubourg, in 1800, mourned by the whole army, who devoted a\nday's pay to the purchase of an urn to preserve his heart, for a niche\nin the Pantheon.\n\nAnother distinction, not less touching, was accorded to his memory by\nthe regiment in which he served. The sergeant, in calling his names in\nthe muster of his company, always called Latour d'Auvergne, and the\ncorporal answered--\"_Mort au champ d'honneur_.\" If the history of this\nhero excited the warm admiration of those opposed to him in arms, the\neffect of its representation on his compatriots may be more easily\nimagined than described. Nothing could exceed the enthusiasm it excited\nin their minds. Men, women, and children, seemed electrified by it.\n\nThere is a chord in the hearts of the French that responds\ninstantaneously, and with vivid emotion, to any appeal made to their\nnational glory; and this susceptibility constitutes the germ so easily\nfructified by those who know how to cultivate it.\n\nEnthusiasm, if it sometimes leads to error, or commits its votaries\ninto the ridiculous, also prompts and accomplishes the most glorious\nachievements; and it is impossible not to feel a sympathy with its\nunsophisticated demonstrations thus evinced _en masse_. Civilization,\nmore than aught else, tends to discourage enthusiasm; and where it is\npushed to the utmost degree of perfection, there will this prompter of\ngreat deeds, this darer of impossibilities and instigator of heroic\nactions, be most rarely found.\n\nDrove yesterday to see the villa of the Duchesse de Montmorency, which\nis to be let. The grounds are very pretty, and a portion of them opens\nby iron rails to the Bois de Boulogne, which is a great advantage. But\nneither the villa nor the grounds are to be compared to the beautiful\nones in the neighbourhood of London, where, as an old French gentleman\nonce observed to me, \"the trees seem to take a peculiar pride and\npleasure in growing.\"\n\nI have seen nothing to be compared with the tasteful villas on green\nvelvet lawns sloping down to the limpid Thames, near Richmond, with\numbrageous trees bending their leafy branches to the earth and water;\nor to the colonnaded mansions peeping forth from the well-wooded\ngrounds of Roehampton and its vicinage.\n\nI can remember as distinctly as if beheld yesterday, the various\ntempting residences that meet the eye in a morning drive, or in a row\non the silvery Thames, compelling the violation of the tenth\ncommandment, by looking so beautiful that one imagines how happily a\nlife might glide away in such abodes, forgetful that in no earthly\nabode can existence be passed free from the cares meant to remind us\nthat this is not our abiding-place.\n\nWent to see Bagatelle yesterday with the Duchesse de G----. Here the\nDuc de Bordeaux and Mademoiselle, his sister, pass much of their time.\nIt is a very pleasant villa, and contains many proofs of the taste and\nindustry of these very interesting children, who are greatly beloved by\nthose who have access to them. Various stories were related to us\nillustrative of their goodness of heart and considerate kindness for\nthose around them; and, making all due allowance for the partiality of\nthe narrators, they went far to prove that these scions of royalty are\nmore amiable and unspoilt than are most children of their age, and of\neven far less elevated rank. \"Born in sorrow, and nursed in tears,\" the\nDuc de Bordeaux's early infancy has not passed under bright auspices;\nand those are not wanting who prophesy that he may hereafter look back\nto the days passed at Bagatelle as the happiest of his life.\n\nIt requires little of the prescience of a soothsayer to make this\nprediction, when we reflect that the lives of even the most popular of\nthose born to the dangerous inheritance of a crown must ever be more\nexposed to the cares that weigh so heavily, and the responsibility that\npresses so continually on them, than are those who, exempt from the\nsplendour of sovereignty, escape also its toils. \"Oh happy they, the\nhappiest of their kind,\" who enjoy, in the peace and repose of a\nprivate station, a competency, good health, a love of, and power of\nindulging in, study; an unreproaching conscience, and a cheerful mind!\nWith such blessings they may contemplate, without a feeling of envy,\nthe more brilliant but less fortunate lots of those great ones of the\nearth, whose elevation but too often serves to render them the target\nat which Fortune loves aim her most envenomed darts.\n\nPassed the greater part of the morning in the house in the Rue de\nMatignon, superintending the alterations and improvements to be carried\ninto execution there. It has been found necessary to build an\nadditional room, which the proprietor pledges himself can be ready for\noccupation in six weeks, and already have its walls reached nearly to\ntheir intended height. The builders seem to be as expeditious as the\nupholsterers at Paris, and adding a room or two to a mansion appears to\nbe as easily accomplished as adding some extra furniture.\n\nOne is made to pay dearly, however, for this facility and expedition;\nfor rents are extravagantly high at Paris, as are also the prices of\nfurniture.\n\nAlready does the terrace begin to assume the appearance of a garden.\nDeep beds of earth inclosed in green cases line the sides, and an\nabundance of orange-trees, flowering shrubs, plants, and flowers, are\nplaced in them.\n\nAt the end of the terrace, the wall which bounds it has been painted in\nfresco, with a view of Italian scenery; and this wall forms the back of\nan aviary, with a fountain that plays in the centre. A smaller aviary,\nconstructed of glass, is erected on the end of the terrace, close to my\nlibrary, from the window of which I can feed my favourite birds; and\nthis aviary, as well as the library, is warmed by means of a stove\nbeneath the latter. The terrace is covered by a lattice-work, formed\ninto arched windows at the side next the court: over the sides and roof\nthere are trailing parasitical plants. Nothing in the new residence\npleases me so much as this suite, and the terrace attached to it.\n\nAlready do we begin to feel the unsettled state peculiar to an intended\nchange of abode, and the prospect of entering a new one disturbs the\nsense of enjoyment of the old. Gladly would we remain where we are, for\nwe prefer this hôtel to any other at Paris; but the days we have to\nsojourn in it are numbered, and our regret is unavailing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\n\nSeptember, 1829.--A chasm of many months in my journal. When last I\nclosed it, little could I have foreseen the terrible blow that awaited\nme. Well may I exclaim with the French writer whose works I have been\njust reading, \"_Nous, qui sommes bornés en tout, comment le sommes-nous\nsi peu quand il s'agit de souffrir_.\" How slowly has time passed since!\nEvery hour counted, and each coloured by care, the past turned to with\nthe vain hope of forgetting the present, and the future no longer\noffering the bright prospect it once unfolded!\n\nHow is my destiny changed since I last opened this book! My hopes have\nfaded and vanished like the leaves whose opening into life I hailed\nwith joy six months ago, little dreaming that before the first cold\nbreath of autumn had tinted them with brown, _he_ who saw them expand\nwith me would have passed from the earth!\n\n_October_.--Ill, and confined to my chamber for several days, my\nphysician prescribes society to relieve low spirits; but in the present\nstate of mine, the remedy seems worse than the disease.\n\nMy old friends Mr. and Mrs. Mathews, and their clever son, have arrived\nat Paris and dined here yesterday. Mr. Matthews is as entertaining as\never, and his wife as amiable and _spirituelle_. They are excellent as\nwell as clever people, and their society is very agreeable. Charles\nMathews, the son, is full of talent, possesses all his father's powers\nof imitation, and sings comic songs of his own composition that James\nSmith himself might be proud to have written.\n\nThe Duc and Duchesse de Guiche, the Marquise de Poulpry, Lady\nCombermere, Madame Craufurd, and Count Valeski, came in the evening,\nand were all highly gratified with some recitations and songs given us\nby Mr. Mathews and his son. They were not less pleased with Mrs.\nMathews, whose manners and conversation are peculiarly fascinating, and\nwhose good looks and youthfulness of appearance made them almost\ndisbelieve that she could be the mother of a grown-up son.\n\nHow forcibly did the recitations and songs bring back former times to\nmy memory, when in St. James's Square, or in his own beautiful cottage\nat Highgate, I have so frequently been delighted by the performances of\nthis clever and worthy man! The recollection of the past occupied me\nmore last night than did the actual present, and caused me to return\nbut a faint echo to the reiterated applause which every new effort of\nhis drew forth from the party. There are moments when the present\nappears like a dream, and that we think the past, which is gone for\never, has more of reality in it!\n\nI took Mr. and Mrs. Mathews to the Jardin des Plantes to-day, and was\nmuch amused by an incident that occurred there. A pretty child, with\nher _bonne_, were seated on a bench near to which we placed ourselves.\nShe was asking questions relative to the animals she had seen, and Mr.\nMathews having turned his head away from her, gave some admirable\nimitations of the sounds peculiar to the beasts of which she was\nspeaking, and also of the voice and speeches of the person who had\nexhibited them.\n\nNever did he exert himself more to please a crowded and admiring\naudience than to amuse this child, who, maintaining an immovable\ngravity during the imitations, quietly observed to her nurse, \"_Ma\nbonne, ce Monsieur est bien drôle_.\"\n\nThe mortification of Mr. Mathews on this occasion was very diverting.\n\"How!\" exclaimed he, \"is it possible that all my efforts to amuse that\nchild have so wholly failed? She never moved a muscle! I suppose the\nFrench children are not so easily pleased as our English men and women\nare?\"\n\nHe reverted to this disappointment more than once during our drive\nback, and seemed dispirited by it. Nevertheless, he gave us some most\nhumorous imitations of the lower orders of the French talking loudly\ntogether, in which he spoke in so many different voices that one could\nhave imagined that no less than half-a-dozen people, at least, were\nengaged in the conversation.\n\nI think so highly of the intellectual powers of Mr. Mathews, and find\nhis conversation so interesting that, admirable as are his imitations,\nI prefer the former. He has seen so much of the world in all its\nphases, that he has a piquant anecdote or a clever story to relate\ntouching every place and almost every person mentioned. Yet, with all\nthis intuitive and acquired knowledge of the world, he possesses all\nthe simplicity of a child, and a good nature that never can resist an\nappeal to it.\n\nSpent all yesterday in reading, and writing letters on business. I\nbegin to experience the _ennui_ of having affairs to attend to, and\ngroan in spirit, if not aloud, at having to read and write dry details\non the subject. To unbend my mind from its painful thoughts and\ntension, I devoted the evening to reading, which affords me the surest\nrelief, by transporting my thoughts from the cares that oppress me.\n\nHad a long visit from my old acquaintance the Count de Montalembert,\nto-day. He is in very low spirits, occasioned by the recent death of an\nonly and charming daughter, and could not restrain his deep emotion,\nwhen recounting to me the particulars of her latter days. His grief was\ncontagious, and found a chord in my heart that responded to it. When we\nlast met, it was in a gay and brilliant party, each of us in high\nspirits; and now, though but a few more years have passed over our\nheads, how changed are our feelings! We meet, not to amuse and to be\namused, but to talk of those we have lost, and whose loss has darkened\nour lives. He spoke of his son, who already gives the promise of\ndistinguishing himself, and of reflecting credit on his family.\n\nHow little do we know people whom we meet only in general society, in\nwhich every one assumes a similar tone and manner, reserving for home\nthe peculiarities that distinguish each from the other, and suppressing\nall demonstration of the feelings indulged only in the privacy of the\ndomestic circle!\n\nI have been many years acquainted with the Count de Montalembert, yet\nnever really appreciated him until today. Had I been asked to describe\nhim yesterday, I should have spoken of him as a _spirituel_, lively,\nand amusing man, with remarkably good manners, a great knowledge of the\nworld, and possessing in an eminent degree the tact and talent _de\nsociété_. Had any one mentioned that he was a man of deep feeling, I\nshould have been disposed to question the discernment of the person who\nasserted it: yet now I am as perfectly convinced of the fact as it is\npossible to be, and had he paid this visit before affliction had\nassailed me, he would not, I am convinced, have revealed his own grief.\nYes, affliction is like the divinatory wand, whose touch discovers\ndeep-buried springs the existence of which was previously unknown.\n\n---- called on me to-day, and talked a good deal of ----. I endeavoured\nto excite sympathy for the unhappy person, but failed in the attempt.\nThe unfortunate generally meet with more blame than pity; for as the\nlatter is a painful emotion, people endeavour to exonerate themselves\nfrom its indulgence, by trying to discover some error which may have\nled to the misfortune they are too selfish to commiserate. Alas! there\nare but few friends who, like ivy, cling to ruin, and ---- is not one\nof these.\n\nThe Prince and Princesse Soutzo dined with us yesterday. They are as\namiable and agreeable as ever, and I felt great gratification in\nmeeting them again. We talked over the many pleasant days we passed\ntogether at Pisa. Alas! how changed is my domestic circle since then!\nThey missed _one_ who would have joined me in welcoming them to Paris,\nand whose unvaried kindness they have not forgotten!\n\nThe \"decent dignity\" with which this interesting couple support their\naltered fortunes, won my esteem on our first acquaintance. Prince\nSoutzo was Hospodar, or reigning Prince of Moldavia, and married the\neldest daughter of Prince Carraga, Hospodar of Walachia. He maintained\nthe state attendant on his high rank, beloved and respected by those he\ngoverned, until the patriotic sentiments inseparable from a great mind\ninduced him to sacrifice rank, fortune, and power, to the cause of\nGreece, his native land. He only saved his life by flight; for the\nangry Sultan with whom he had previously been a great favourite, had\nalready sent an order for his decapitation! Never was a reverse of\nfortune borne with greater equanimity than by this charming family,\nwhose virtues, endowments, and acquirements, fit them for the most\nelevated station.\n\nMy old acquaintances, Mr. Rogers the poet, and Mr. Luttrell, called on\nme to-day. Of how many pleasant days in St. James's Square did the\nsight of both remind me! Such days I shall pass there no more: but I\nmust not give way to reflections that are, alas! as unavailing as they\nare painful. Both of these my old friends are unchanged. Time has dealt\ngently by them during the seven years that have elapsed since we last\nmet: the restless tyrant has been less merciful to me. We may, however,\nbear with equanimity the ravages of Time, if we meet the destroyer side\nby side with those dear to us, those who have witnessed our youth and\nmaturity, and who have advanced with us into the autumn of life; but,\nwhen they are lost to us, how dreary becomes the prospect!\n\nHow difficult it is to prevent the mind from dwelling on thoughts\nfraught with sadness, when once the chord of memory vibrates to the\ntouch of grief!\n\nMr. Rogers talked of Byron, and evinced a deep feeling of regard for\nhis memory, He little knows the manner in which he is treated in a\ncertain poem, written by him in one of his angry moods, and which I\nurged him, but in vain, to commit to the flames. The knowledge of it,\nhowever, would, I am convinced, excite no wrath in the heart of Rogers,\nwho would feel more sorrow than anger that one he believed his friend\ncould have written so bitter a diatribe against him. And, truth to say,\nthe poem in question is more injurious to the memory of Byron than it\ncould be painful to him who is the subject of it; but I hope that it\nmay never be published, and I think no one who had delicacy or feeling\nwould bring it to light.\n\nByron read this lampoon to us one day at Genoa, and enjoyed our dismay\nat it like a froward boy who has achieved what he considers some\nmischievous prank. He offered us a copy, but we declined to accept it;\nfor, being in the habit of seeing Mr. Rogers frequently beneath our\nroof, we thought it would be treacherous to him. Byron, however, found\nothers less scrupulous, and three or four copies of it have been given\naway.\n\nThe love of mischief was strong in the heart of Byron even to the last,\nbut, while recklessly indulging it in trifles, he was capable of giving\nproofs of exalted friendship to those against whom he practised it;\nand, had Rogers stood in need of kindness, he would have found no lack\nof it in his brother poet, even in the very hour he had penned the\nmalicious lampoon in question against him.\n\nComte d'Orsay, with his frank _naÏveté_, observed, \"I thought you were\none of Mr. Rogers's most intimate friends, and so all the world had\nreason to think, after reading your dedication of the _Giaour_ to him.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Byron, laughing, \"and it is our friendship that gives\nme the privilege of taking a liberty with him.\"\n\n\"If it is thus you evince your friendship,\" replied Comte d'Orsay, \"I\nshould be disposed to prefer your enmity.\"\n\n\"You,\" said Byron, \"could never excite this last sentiment in my\nbreast, for you neither say nor do spiteful things.\"\n\nBrief as was the period Byron had lived in what is termed fashionable\nsociety in London, it was long enough to have engendered in him a habit\nof _persiflage_, and a love of uttering sarcasms, (more from a desire\nof displaying wit than from malice,) peculiar to that circle in which,\nif every man's hand is not against his associates, every man's tongue\nis. He drew no line of demarcation between _uttering_ and _writing_\nsatirical things; and the first being, if not sanctioned, at least\npermitted in the society in which he had lived in London, he considered\nhimself not more culpable in inditing his satires than the others were\nin speaking them. He would have laughed at being censured for putting\non paper the epigrammatic malice that his former associates would\ndelight in uttering before all except the person at whom it was aimed;\nyet the world see the matter in another point of view, and many of\nthose who _speak_ as much evil of their _soi-disant_ friends, would\ndeclare, if not feel, themselves shocked at Byron's writing it.\n\nI know no more agreeable member of society than Mr. Luttrell. His\nconversation, like a limpid stream, flows smoothly and brightly along,\nrevealing the depths beneath its current, now sparkling over the\nobjects it discloses or reflecting those by which it glides. He never\ntalks for talking's sake; but his mind is so well filled that, like a\nfountain which when stirred sends up from its bosom sparkling showers,\nhis mind, when excited, sends forth thoughts no less bright than\nprofound, revealing the treasures with which it is so richly stored.\nThe conversation of Mr. Luttrell makes me think, while that of many\nothers only amuses me.\n\nLord John Russell has arrived at Paris, and sat with me a considerable\ntime to-day. How very agreeable he can be when his reserve wears off,\nand what a pity it is he should ever allow it to veil the many fine\nqualities he possesses! Few men have a finer taste in literature, or a\nmore highly cultivated mind. It seizes with rapidity whatever is\nbrought before it; and being wholly free from passion or egotism, the\nviews he takes on all subjects are just and unprejudiced. He has a\nquick perception of the ridiculous, and possesses a fund of dry caustic\nhumour that might render him a very dangerous opponent in a debate,\nwere it not governed by a good breeding and a calmness that never\nforsake him.\n\nLord John Russell is precisely the person calculated to fill a high\nofficial situation. Well informed on all subjects, with an ardent love\nof his country, and an anxious desire to serve it, he has a sobriety of\njudgment and a strictness of principle that will for ever place him\nbeyond the reach of suspicion, even to the most prejudiced of his\npolitical adversaries. The reserve complained of by those who are only\nsuperficially acquainted with him, would be highly advantageous to a\nminister; for it would not only preserve him from the approaches to\nfamiliarity, so injurious to men in power, but would discourage the\nhopes founded on the facility of manner of those whose very smiles and\nsimple acts of politeness are by the many looked on as an encouragement\nto form the most unreasonable ones, and as an excuse for the indulgence\nof angry feelings when those unreasonable hopes are frustrated.\n\nLord John Russell, Mr. Rogers, Mr. Luttrell, Monsieur Thiers, Monsieur\nMignet, and Mr. Poulett Thomson, dined here yesterday. The party was an\nagreeable one, and the guests seemed mutually pleased with each other.\n\nMonsieur Thiers is a very remarkable person--quick, animated, and\nobservant: nothing escapes him, and his remarks are indicative of a\nmind of great power. I enjoy listening to his conversation, which is at\nonce full of originality, yet free from the slightest shade of\neccentricity.\n\nMonsieur Mignet, who is the inseparable friend of Monsieur Thiers,\nreminds me every time I see him of Byron, for there is a striking\nlikeness in the countenance. With great abilities, Monsieur Mignet\ngives me the notion of being more fitted to a life of philosophical\nresearch and contemplation than of action, while Monsieur Thiers\nimpresses me with the conviction of his being formed to fill a busy and\nconspicuous part in the drama of life.\n\nHe is a sort of modern Prometheus, capable of creating and of vivifying\nwith the electric spark of mind; but, whether he would steal the fire\nfrom Heaven, or a less elevated region, I am not prepared to say. He\nhas called into life a body--and a vast one--by his vigorous writings,\nand has infused into it a spirit that will not be soon or easily\nquelled. Whether that spirit will tend to the advancement of his\ncountry or not, time will prove; but, _en attendant_, its ebullitions\nmay occasion as much trouble to the _powers that be_ as did the spirit\nengendered by Mirabeau in a former reign.\n\nThe countenance of Monsieur Thiers is remarkable. The eyes, even\nthrough his spectacles, flash with intelligence, and the expression of\nhis face varies with every sentiment he utters. Thiers is a man to\neffect a revolution, and Mignet would be the historian to narrate it.\n\nThere is something very interesting in the unbroken friendship of these\ntwo men of genius, and its constancy elevates both in my estimation.\nThey are not more unlike than are their respective works, both of\nwhich, though so dissimilar, are admirable in their way. The mobility\nand extreme excitability of the French, render such men as Monsieur\nThiers extremely dangerous to monarchical power. His genius, his\neloquence, and his boldness, furnish him with the means of exciting the\nenthusiasm of his countrymen as surely as a torch applied to gunpowder\nproduces an explosion. In England these qualities, however elevated,\nwould fail to produce similar results; for enthusiasm is there little\nknown, and, when it comes forth, satisfies itself with a brief\nmanifestation, and swiftly resigns itself to the prudent jurisdiction\nof reason. Napoleon himself, with all the glory associated with his\nname--a glory that intoxicated the French--would have failed to\ninebriate the sober-minded English.\n\nThrough my acquaintance with the Baron de Cailleux, who is at the head\nof the Musée, I obtained permission to take Lord John Russell, Mr.\nRogers, and Mr. Luttrell, to the galleries of the Louvre yesterday, it\nbeing a day on which the public are excluded. The Baron received us,\ndid the honours of the Musée with all the intelligence and urbanity\nthat distinguish him, and made as favourable an impression on my\ncountrymen as they seemed to have produced on him.\n\nRogers has a pure taste in the fine arts, and has cultivated it _con\namore_; Luttrell brings to the study a practised eye and a matured\njudgment; but Lord John, nurtured from infancy in dwellings, the walls\nof which glow with the _chefs-d'oeuvre_ of the old masters and the best\nworks of the modern ones, possesses an exquisite tact in recognizing at\na glance the finest points in a picture, and reasons on them with all\nthe _savoir_ of a connoisseur and the feeling of an amateur.\n\nIt is a pleasant thing to view collections of art with those fully\ncapable of appreciating them, and I enjoyed this satisfaction\nyesterday. The Baron de Cailleux evinced no little pleasure in\nconducting my companions from one masterpiece to another, and two or\nthree hours passed away rapidly in the interesting study.\n\nThe Marquis and Marquise de B----, Comte V----, and some others, dined\nhere yesterday. The Marquise de B---- is very clever, has agreeable\nmanners, knows the world thoroughly, and neither under nor overvalues\nit. A constant friction with society, while it smoothes down asperities\nand polishes manners, is apt to impair if not destroy much of the\noriginality and raciness peculiar to clever people. To suit themselves\nto the ordinary level of society, they become either insipid or\nsatirical; they mix too much water, or apply cayenne pepper to the wine\nof their conversation: hence that mind which, apart from the artificial\natmosphere of the busy world, might have grown into strength and\nbeauty, becomes like some poor child nurtured in the unhealthy\nprecincts of a dense and crowded city,--diseased, stunted, rickety, and\nincapable of distinguishing itself from its fellows.\n\nAs clever people cannot elevate the mass with which they herd to their\nown level, they are apt to sink to theirs; and persons with talents\nthat might have served for nobler purposes are suffered to degenerate\ninto _diseurs de bons mots_ and _raconteurs de société_, content with\nthe paltry distinction of being considered amusing. How many such have\nI encountered, satisfied with being pigmies, who might have grown to be\ngiants, but who were consoled by the reflection that in that world in\nwhich their sole aim is to shine, pigmies are more tolerated than\ngiants, as people prefer looking down to looking up!\n\nLord Allen and Sir Andrew Barnard dined here yesterday. They appear to\nenter into the gaiety of Paris with great zest, go the round of the\ntheatres, dine at all the celebrated _restaurateurs_, mix enough in the\n_beau monde_ to be enabled to observe the difference between the\nParisian and London one, and will, at the expiration of the term\nassigned to their _séjour_ here, return to England well satisfied with\ntheir trip and with themselves.\n\nLord A---- has tasted all the _nouveaux plats à la mode_, for at Paris\nnew dishes are as frequently invented as new bonnets or caps; and the\nproficiency in the culinary art which he has acquired will render him\nan oracle at his clubs, until the more recent arrival of some other\nepicurean from the French capital deposes his brief sovereignty.\n\nBut it is not in the culinary art alone that Lord Allen evinces his\ngood taste, for no one is a better judge of all that constitutes the\n_agrémens_ of life, or more _au fait_ of the [* omitted word?] of\ncontributing to them.\n\nSir A. B----, as devoted as ever to music, has heard all the new, and\nfinds that the old, like old friends, loses nothing by comparison. It\nis pleasant to see that the advance of years impairs not the taste for\na refined and innocent pleasure.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\n\nMr. Rogers and Mr. Luttrell spent last evening here. The minds of both\nteem with reflection, and their conversation is a high intellectual\ntreat to me. There is a repose in the society of clever and refined\nEnglishmen to be met with in no other: the absence of all attempts to\nshine, or at least of the evidence of such attempts; the mildness of\nthe manners; the low voices, the freedom from any flattery, except the\nmost delicate and acceptable of all to a fastidious person, namely,\nthat implied by the subjects of conversation chosen, and the interest\nyielded to them;--yes, these peculiarities have a great charm for me,\nand Mr. Rogers and Mr. Luttrell possess them in an eminent degree.\n\nThe mercurial temperaments of the French preclude them from this\ncalmness of manner and mildness of speech. More obsequiously polite and\nattentive to women, the exuberance of their animal spirits often\nhurries them into a gaiety evinced by brilliant sallies and clever\nobservations. They shine, but they let the desire to do so be too\nevident to admit of that quietude that forms one of the most agreeable,\nas well as distinguishing, attributes of the conversation of a refined\nand highly-intellectual Englishman.\n\n---- and ---- spent last evening here. Two more opposite characters\ncould not easily have encountered. One influenced wholly by his\nfeelings, the other by his reason, each seemed to form a low estimate\nof the other; and this, _malgré_ all the restraint imposed by good\nbreeding, was but too visible. Neither has any cause to be vain, for he\nbecomes a dupe who judges with his heart instead of his head, and an\negotist who permits not his heart to be touched by the toleration of\nhis head. ---- is often duped, but sometimes liked for his good nature;\nwhile ----, if never duped, is never liked.\n\nI took Lord John Russell, Mr. Rogers, and Mr. Luttrell yesterday to La\nMuette to see M. Erard's fine collection of pictures, with which they\nwere very much pleased. Our drive to the Bois de Boulogne was a very\nagreeable one, and was rendered so by their pleasant conversation.\n\nI have presented Mr. Rogers with some acquisitions for his cabinet of\nantique _bijouterie_, with which he appears delighted. I outbid M.\nMillingen, who was bargaining at Naples for these little treasures, and\nsecured a diminutive Cupid, a Bacchus, and a small bunch of grapes of\npure gold, and of exquisite workmanship, which will now be transferred\nto the museum of my friend, Mr. Rogers. He will not, I dare say, be\nmore grateful for the gift of my Cupid than his sex generally are when\nladies no longer young bestow their love on them, and so I hinted when\ngiving him the little winged god; but, _n'importe_, the gift may\nplease, though the giver be forgotten.\n\nLord Pembroke dined here yesterday, he is peculiarly well-bred and\ngentlemanlike, and looks a nobleman from top to toe. He has acquired\nall the polish and _savoir-vivre_ of the best foreign society without\nhaving lost any of the more solid and fine qualities peculiar to the\nmost distinguished portion of his countrymen. Lord Pembroke maintains\nthe reputation of English taste in equipages by sporting horses and\ncarriages that excite the admiration, if not the envy, of the\nParisians, among whom he is, and deserves to be, very popular.\n\nThe Duke of Hamilton paid me a long visit to-day. We talked over old\ntimes, and our mutual friend Dr. Parr, in whose society we formerly\npassed such agreeable hours in St. James's Square. The Duke is a very\nwell-informed man, has read much, and remembers what he has read; and\nthe ceremoniousness of his manners, with which some people find fault,\nI have got used to, and rather like than otherwise. The mixture of\nchivalric sentiments, Scotch philosophy, and high breeding of the old\nFrench school which meet in the Duke, render his conversation very\npiquant.\n\nHe has, indeed, the dignity of his three dukedoms; the _fierté_ of that\nof Chatelherault, the reserve of that of England, and the spirit of\nthat of Scotland: witness his dignified reproof to the Duc de Blacas at\nRome, when that very unpopular personage, then Ambassador from the\ncourt of France, presumed to comment on the frequency of the Duke of\nHamilton's visits to the Princess Pauline Borghese, who, being a\nBuonaparte, was looked on with a jealous eye by Blacas.\n\nMonsieur Mignet spent last evening here. The more I see of him the more\nI am pleased with his society. To a mind stored with knowledge he joins\na happy facility of bringing forth its treasures, never as if\nostentatious of his wealth, but in illustration of any topic that is\ndiscussed, on which he brings it to bear most aptly and appropriately.\nHis countenance lights up with expression when he converses, and adds\nforce to an eloquence always interesting and often instructive.\n\nThough Monsieur Mignet shines in monologue more than in dialogue, there\nis nothing either dictatorial or pedantic in his manner, he utters\nopinions new and original, which it is evident he has deeply reflected\non, and elucidates them to the comprehension of his auditors with great\nfelicity. I like listening to the conversation of such a man; and\nclever people, when they find an attentive listener, are incited to\ntalk well.\n\nIn general society, in which many persons of totally opposite tastes,\npursuits, and opinions, are thrown together, a clever man has seldom an\nopportunity of bringing forth the treasures of his mind. He can only\ndispense the small coin, which is easily changed with those he comes in\ncontact with; but the weighty and valuable, metal is not brought into\nuse, because he knows the greater number of those, around him could\ngive him no equivalent in exchange.\n\n----, conversing with Lady ---- to-day, she observed that in early life\nconscience has less influence than in advanced life, and accounted for\nit by the nearer approach to death rendering people more alarmed, and\nconsequently more disposed to listen to it. Some persons attribute all\ngood impulses to fear, as if mortals were more governed by its\ninfluence than by that of love and gratitude.\n\nIf conscience is less frequently heard in youth, it is that the\ntumultuous throbbing of the heart, and the wild suggestions of the\npassions, prevent its \"still small voice\" from being audible; but in\nthe decline of life, when the heart beats languidly and the passions\nslumber, it makes itself heard, and on its whispers depends our\nhappiness or misery.\n\nMy old acquaintance, Lord Palmerston, has arrived at Paris, and dined\nhere yesterday, to meet the Duc and Duchesse de Guiche, Count Valeski,\nand Mr. Poulett Thomson. Seven years have produced no change in Lord\nPalmerston. He is the same intelligent, sensible, and agreeable person\nthat I remember him to have been for many years.\n\nLord Palmerston has much more ability than people are disposed to give\nhim credit for. He is, or used to be, when I lived in England,\nconsidered a good man of business, acute in the details, and quick in\nthe comprehension of complicated questions. Even this is no mean\npraise, but I think him entitled to more; for, though constantly and\nbusily occupied with official duties, he has contrived to find time to\nread every thing worth reading, and to make himself acquainted with the\npolitics of other countries.\n\nLively, well-bred, and unaffected, Lord Palmerston is a man that is so\nwell acquainted with the routine of official duties, performs them so\nreadily and pleasantly, and is so free from the assumption of\nself-importance that too frequently appertains to adepts in them, that,\nwhether Whig or Tory government has the ascendant in England, his\nservices will be always considered a desideratum to be secured if\npossible.\n\nLord Castlereagh, Mr. Cutlar Fergusson, and Count Valeski dined here\nyesterday. Lord C. has just arrived from England, and is a good\nspecimen of the young men of the present day. He reminds me of his\nuncle, the late Marquess of Londonderry, one of the most amiable and\nwell-bred men I ever knew. Lord C---- is very animated and piquant in\nconversation, thinks for himself, and says what he thinks with a\nfrankness not often met with in our times. Yet there is no _brusquerie_\nin his manners; _au contraire_, they are soft and very pleasing; and\nthis contrast between the originality and fearlessness of his opinions,\nand the perfect good-breeding with which they are expressed, lend a\npeculiar attraction to his manner. If Lord C---- were not a man of\nfashion he would become something vastly better, for he has much of the\nchivalrous spirit of his father and the tact of his uncle. Fashion is\nthe gulf in whose vortex so many fine natures are wrecked in England;\nwhat a pity it is that they cannot be rescued from its dangers!\n\nMr. Cutlar Fergusson is a clever and amiable man, mild, well-informed,\nand agreeable.\n\nThe Baron and Baroness de Ruysch spent yesterday with us. They are an\nestimable couple, and very pleasant withal. His philosophy, which has\nnothing of the ascetic in it, harmonises very well with her vivacity,\nand her sprightliness never degenerates into levity. It is the gaiety\nof a mind at ease, pleased with others, and content with self. How\nunlike the exuberant spirits of ----, which always depress mine more\nthan a day's _tête-à-tête_ with the moodiest hypochondriac could do!\n\nNothing can be more dreary and cheerless than the weather; and a second\nwinter's residence at Paris has convinced me that London is infinitely\npreferable at this season, except to those who consider gaiety an\nequivalent for comfort. The negligence and bad management of the\npersons whose duty it is to remove the snow or mud from the streets,\nrender them not only nearly impassable for pedestrians but exceedingly\ndisagreeable to those who have carriages.\n\nPreviously to the heavy fall of snow that occurred a week ago, and\nwhich still encumbers the streets, a succession of wet days occasioned\nan accumulation of mud that gave forth most unsavoury odours, and lent\na damp chilliness to the atmosphere which sent home to their sick\nchambers, assailed by sore throats and all the other miseries peculiar\nto colds, many of those who were so imprudent as to venture abroad. The\nsnow, instead of being swept away, is piled up on each side of the\nstreets, forming a wall that increases the gloom and chilliness that\nreigns around. The fogs, too, rise from the Seine, and hover over the\nChamps-Elysées and streets adjacent to it, rendering a passage through\nthem a service of danger.\n\nLord Castlereagh and Madame Grassini dined here last evening. He was\nmuch amused with the raciness and originality of her remarks; and she\nwas greatly gratified by the polite attention with which he listened to\nthem. At one moment, she pronounced him to be \"_la vraie image de ce\ncher et bon Lord Castlereagh_,\" whom she had so much liked; and the\nnext she declared him to be exactly like \"_ce preux chevalier, son\npère_,\" who was so irresistible that no female heart, or, as she said,\nat least no Italian female heart, could resist him.\n\nThen she spoke of \"_ce cher et excellent Duc de Wellington_,\" who had\nbeen so kind to her, asked a thousand questions about him, the tears\nstarting into her brilliant eyes as she dwelt on the reminiscences of\nthose days when, considered the finest singer and most beautiful woman\nof her time, she received a homage accorded to her beauty and talent\nnever since so universally decreed to any other _prima donna_. The\nGrassini cannot be known without being liked, she is so warm-hearted,\nunaffected, and sincere.\n\nThe prettiest sight imaginable was a party of our friends in sledges,\nwho yesterday passed through the streets. This was the first time I had\never seen this mode of conveyance, and nothing can be more picturesque.\nThe sledge of the Duc de Guiche, in which reclined the Duchesse, the\nDuc seated behind her and holding, at each side of her, the reins of\nthe horse, presented the form of a swan, the feathers beautifully\nsculptured. The back of this colossal swan being hollowed out, admitted\na seat, which, with the whole of the interior, was covered with fine\nfur. The harness and trappings of the superb horse that drew it were\nrichly decorated, and innumerable silver bells were attached to it, the\nsound of which was pleasant to the ear.\n\nThe Duchesse, wrapped in a pelisse of the finest Russian sable, never\nlooked handsomer than in her sledge, her fair cheeks tinged with a\nbright pink by the cold air, and her luxuriant silken curls falling on\nthe dark fur that encircled her throat.\n\nCount A. d'Orsay's sledge presented the form of a dragon, and the\naccoutrements and horse were beautiful; the harness was of red morocco,\nembroidered with gold. The Prince Poniatowski and Comte Valeski\nfollowed in sledges of the ordinary Russian shape, and the whole\ncavalcade had a most picturesque effect. The Parisians appeared to be\nhighly delighted with the sight, and, above all, with the beautiful\nDuchesse borne along through the snow in her swan.\n\nMy medical adviser pressed me so much to accede to the wishes of my\nfriends and try the salutary effect of a drive in a sledge, that I\nyesterday accompanied them to St.-Cloud, where we dined, and returned\nat night by torch-light. Picturesque as is the appearance of the\nsledges by day-light, it is infinitely more so by night, particularly\nof those that have the form of animals or birds.\n\nThe swan of the Duchesse de Guiche had bright lamps in its eyes, which\nsent forth a clear light that was reflected in prismatic colours on the\ndrifted snow, and ice-gemmed branches of the trees, as we drove through\nthe Bois de Boulogne. Grooms, bearing lighted torches, preceded each\nsledge; and the sound of the bells in the Bois, silent and deserted at\nthat hour, made one fancy one's self transported to some far northern\nregion.\n\nThe dragon of Comte A. d'Orsay looked strangely fantastic at night. In\nthe mouth, as well as the eyes, was a brilliant red light; and to a\ntiger-skin covering, that nearly concealed the cream-coloured horse,\nrevealing only the white mane and tail, was attached a double line of\nsilver gilt bells, the jingle of which was very musical and cheerful.\n\nThe shadows of the tall trees falling on an immense plain of snow, the\nlight flashing in fitful gleams from the torches and lamps as we were\nhurried rapidly along, looked strange and unearthly, and reminded me of\nsome of the scenes described in those northern fictions perused in the\nhappy days of childhood.\n\nThis excursion and exposure to the wintry air procured me a good\nnight's sleep,--the first enjoyed since the severity of the weather has\ndeprived me of my usual exercise. This revival of an old fashion (for\nin former days sledges were considered as indispensable in the winter\n_remise_ of a grand seigneur in France as cabriolets or britchkas are\nin the summer) has greatly pleased the Parisian world, and crowds flock\nto see them as they pass along. The velocity of the movement, the\ngaiety of the sound of the bells, and the cold bracing air, have a very\nexhilarating effect on the spirits.\n\nMet the Prince Polignac at the Duchesse de G----'s today. His\ncountenance is remarkably good, his air and manner _très-distingué_,\nand his conversation precisely what might be expected from an English\ngentleman--mild, reasonable, and unaffected. If I had not previously\nknown him to be one or the most amiable men in the world, I should have\nsoon formed this judgment of him, for every expression of his\ncountenance, and every word he utters, give this impression.\n\nThe Prince Polignac has lived much in England, and seems to me to be\nformed to live there, for his tastes are decidedly English. Twice\nmarried, both his wives were English; so that it is no wonder that he\nhas adopted much of our modes of thinking. Highly as I am disposed to\nestimate him, I do not think that he is precisely the person calculated\nto cope with the difficulties that must beset a minister, and, above\nall, a minister in France, in times like the present.\n\nThe very qualities that render him so beloved in private life, and\nwhich make his domestic circle one of the happiest in the world, are\nperhaps those which unfit him for so trying a post as the one he is now\ncalled on to hold--a post requiring abilities so various, and\nqualifications so manifold, that few, if any, could be found to possess\nthe rare union.\n\nA spirit is rife in France that renders the position of _premier_ in it\nalmost untenable; and he must unite the firmness of a stoic, the\nknowledge of a Machiavelli, and the boldness of a Napoleon, who could\nhope to stem the tide that menaces to set in and sweep away the present\ninstitutions. If honesty of intention, loyalty to his sovereign,\npersonal courage, attachment to his country, and perfect\ndisinterestedness could secure success, then might Prince Polignac\nexpect it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\n\nMay.--Some months have elapsed since I noted down a line in this book.\nIndisposition and its usual attendants, languor and lassitude, have\ncaused me to throw it by. Time that once rolled as pleasantly as\nrapidly along, seems now to pace as slowly as sadly; and even the\napproach of spring, that joyous season never before unwelcomed, now\nawakens only painful recollections. Who can see the trees putting forth\ntheir leaves without a dread that, ere they have yet expanded into\ntheir full growth, some one may be snatched away who with us hailed\ntheir first opening verdure?\n\nWhen once Death has invaded our hearths and torn from us some dear\nobject on whose existence our happiness depended, we lose all the\nconfidence previously fondly and foolishly experienced in the stability\nof the blessings we enjoy, and not only deeply mourn those lost, but\ntremble for those yet spared to us. I once thought that I could never\nbehold this genial season without pleasure; alas! it now occasions only\ngloom.\n\nCaptain William Anson, the brother of Lord Anson, dined here yesterday.\nHe is a very remarkable young man; highly distinguished in his\nprofession, being considered one of the best officers in the navy, and\npossessing all the accomplishments of a finished gentleman. His reading\nhas been extensive, and his memory is very retentive. He has been in\nmost quarters of the globe, and has missed no opportunity of\ncultivating his mind and of increasing his stock of knowledge. He is,\nindeed, a worthy descendant of his great ancestor, who might well be\nproud of such a scion to the ancient stock. Devoted to the arduous\nduties of his profession, he studies every amelioration in it _con\namore_; and, if a long life be granted to him, will prove one of its\nbrightest ornaments.\n\nThe Marquis and Marquise de B---- spent last evening here, and several\npeople dropped in. Among them was the pretty Madame de la H----, as\npiquant and lively as ever, as content with herself (and she has reason\nto be so, being very good-looking and amusing) and as careless of the\nsuffrages of others. I like the young and the gay of my own sex, though\nI am no longer either.\n\nPrince Paul Lieven and Captain Cadogan[8] dined here yesterday. The\nfirst is as _spirituel_ and clever as formerly, and the second is as\nfrank, high-spirited, and well-bred--the very _beau idéal_ of a son of\nthe sea, possessing all the attributes of that generous race, joined to\nall those said to be peculiar to the high-born and well-educated.\n\nI like the conversation of such men--men who, nursed in the lap of\nluxury, are sent from the noble dwellings of their sires to be\n\"cabined, cribbed, confined,\" in (to my thinking) the most unbearable\nof all prisons--a ship; pass months and years exposed to hardships,\nprivations, and dangers, from the endurance of which even the poor and\nlowly born often shrink, and bring back to society the high breeding\nand urbanity not to be surpassed in those whose lots have been exempt\nfrom such trials; and, what is still more precious, the experience and\nreflection acquired in their perilous profession, and in the many hours\nof solitude and anxiety that appertain to it.\n\nSat a considerable time with the Duchesse de Guiche today. How amiable\nand kind-hearted she is, and how unspoilt by all the brilliancy of her\nposition! While I was there the mother and son of a young page, for\nwhom the Duc and Duchesse have obtained that office at court, came to\nthank her. The boy is a very fine youth, and the mother and sister seem\nto dote on him. They reminded me of the mother and sister that a\nsentimental writer would have created for the occasion, being\nexceedingly interesting in their appearance and manner. The boy was\nevidently as fond and proud of them as they were of him, and the group\nformed a charming picture.\n\nThe warmth and gentleness of the manners of the Duchesse de G----, and\nthe remarkable beauty of her face and figure, never appeared more\ncaptivating in my eyes than when I beheld her to-day, evincing such\ngood nature to the youthful page and his mother and sister; and I saw\nby their eyes, when they took leave of her, that she sent away grateful\nhearts.\n\n_July_ 1830.--Indisposition has interrupted my journal for several\nweeks, and idleness has prolonged the chasm. The noting down the daily\nrecurrence of uninteresting events is as dull as the endurance of them.\n\nIf reports may be credited, we are on the eve of some popular commotion\nin France, and the present ministers are said to be either ignorant of\nthe danger that menaces, or unprepared to meet it. The conquest of\nAlgiers has produced much less exultation in the people than might have\nnaturally been expected; and this indifference to an event calculated\nto gratify the _amour-propre_ which forms so peculiar a characteristic\nof the nation, is considered a bad sign by those who affect to be\nacquainted with the people. I have so often heard rumours of discontent\nand revolts that I have grown incredulous, and I think and hope the\nFrench are too wise to try any dangerous experiments.\n\n_26th July_.--This morning General E---- came to breakfast with us, and\nannounced that the ordonnances were yesterday signed in council at St.-\nCloud. This good man and brave soldier expressed the liveliest regret\nat this rash measure, and the utmost alarm at the consequences likely\nto result from it. Is Charles the Tenth ignorant of the actual state of\nthings in Paris, and of the power of public opinion? or does he hope to\nvanquish the resistance likely to be offered to this act? I hope his\nmajesty may not acquire this knowledge when it has become too late to\nderive advantage from it.\n\nThe unpopularity of the present ministry, and above all of its leader,\nthe Prince Polignac, is surprising, when one considers how estimable\nhis private character is, and that theirs are irreproachable. They are\nrendered responsible for the will of the sovereign, who, if report\nspeak truth, is very pertinacious in exacting a rigid fulfilment of it\nwhenever it is exercised.\n\nThe present are not times to try experiments how far the will of a\nmonarch can be pushed; and it is not in France, as in England, where\nour law supposes that a king can do no wrong, for the French are prone\nto pay no more respect to sovereigns than to their supposed advisers,\nand both may suffer a heavy penalty for incurring the dislike of the\npeople.\n\nThe prosperity of France, which is acknowledged by all, has failed to\nsilence the murmurs of discontent which, loud and deep, are heard every\nwhere save in the palace,--too frequently the last place where public\nopinion gets an impartial hearing. The success of the Algerine\nexpedition has buoyed up the confidence of the ministry in their own\nstrength; but, if I may credit what I hear, it has by no means really\nadded to it.\n\nConcessions too long delayed come with a bad grace when at length\nextorted, and the change of ministry factiously demanded, even if\ncomplied with, would have placed the sovereign in any thing but a\ndignified position. The dissolution of the Chambers in March, after a\nsession of only ten days, might be considered as a demonstration of\ndiscontent on the part of the monarch, as well as a want of power of\nquelling the spirit that evoked it.\n\nA circumstance, trivial in itself, added to this unpopularity, which\nwas, that several of the deputies were on their route to Paris when the\nunexpected intelligence of the dissolution reached them, and they could\nnot pardon the expense to which they had been put by this unnecessary\n_frais de route_, their places in the diligence being paid for. How\nfrequently do trifles exercise a powerful influence over grave affairs!\n\nThe portion of the public press that advocates the defence of the\ngovernment is even more injudicious than that which assails it; and the\nmonarchy has decidedly suffered in general opinion by the angry\nexcitement produced by the recrimination of both parties. The\nprosecutions entered into against the editors of the liberal papers are\nconsidered by the party to which they belong to be persecutions; and\nthe sentiments avowed by the _Gazette de France_ are received as those\nof not only the government but of the sovereign. The discussions\noccasioned by these prosecutions, as well as by the principles of\nmonarchical absolutism maintained by the adverse party, have greatly\nextended the ranks of the liberals, who, looking on the editors who\nexpound or promulgate their opinions as martyrs, become more\nexasperated against their opponents, and more reckless in the modes\nlikely to be adopted for marking their disapprobation.\n\n_27th_.--On returning from a late drive last night we passed near the\nhôtel of the Minister _des Finances_, around which some fifty or sixty\npersons, chiefly youths, were assembled, crying out \"_Vive la charte!_\"\n\"_A bas les ministres!_\" A patrol passed close to these persons, but\nmade no attempt to disperse them, which I think was rather unwise, for,\nencouraged by this impunity, their numbers, I am told, increased\nrapidly.\n\nI have just heard that the post of _gendarmes_ was tripled this\nmorning, and that a crowd of persons have assembled around the hôtel of\nthe Prince Polignac, where a cabinet council was held. It is said that\nthe ministers were insulted as they entered. This looks ill;\nnevertheless, I trust that it is nothing more than a demonstration of\nthe spirit that is rife in the people, and that no more violent ones\nwill be resorted to. The visitors I have seen to-day seem much alarmed.\n\nThe Duc de Guiche set off for St.-Cloud yesterday morning, the moment\nhe had read the ordonnances. Had his counsel been listened to, they\nwould never have been promulgated; for he is one of the few who, with a\nfreedom from prejudice that enables him to judge dispassionately of the\nactual state of public opinion, has the moral courage to declare the\ntruth to his sovereign, however unpalatable that truth might be, or\nhowever prejudicial to his own interests.\n\nI have this moment returned from a drive through the streets, and,\nthough far from being an alarmist, I begin to think that affairs wear a\nmore serious aspect than I dreaded. Already has a collision taken place\nbetween the populace and the soldiers, who attempted to disperse them\nnear the Palais-Royal; and it required the assistance of a charge of\ncavalry to secure the dangerous victory to themselves.\n\nCrowds were hurrying through the streets, many of the shops were\nclosed, and not above three or four carriages were to be seen. Never\ndid so great a change take place in the aspect of a city in so few\nhours! Yesterday the business of life flowed on in its usual current.\nThe bees and the drones of this vast hive were buzzing about, and the\nbutterflies of fashion were expanding their gay wings in the sunshine.\nTo-day the industrious and orderly seem frightened from their usual\noccupations, and scarcely a person of those termed fashionable is to be\nseen. Where are all the household of Charles the Tenth, that vast and\nwell-paid crowd who were wont to fill the anterooms of the Tuileries on\ngala days, obsequiously watching to catch a nod from the monarch, whose\nslightest wish was to them as the laws of the Modes and Persians? Can\nit be that they have disappeared at the first cloud that has darkened\nthe horizon of their sovereign, and increased the danger that menaces\nhim by shewing that they have not courage to meet it? Heaven send, for\nthe honour of France, that the _noblesse_ of the court of Charles the\nTenth may not follow the disgraceful example furnished by that of his\nunfortunate brother, Louis the Sixteenth! In England how different\nwould it be if danger menaced the sovereign!\n\n---- has just been here, and, in answer to my question of where are the\nmen on whose fidelity the king could count, and in whose military\nexperience he might confide in such a crisis as the present, he told me\nthat for the purposes of election interests all the general officers\nwho could be trusted had unfortunately been sent from the court.\n\nThe sound of firing has announced that order, far from being restored,\nseems less likely than ever to be so. People are rushing wildly through\nthe streets proclaiming that several persons have been killed by the\nmilitary. All is confusion and alarm, and every one appears to dread\nwhat the coming night may produce.\n\nIntelligence has just reached us that the mob are demolishing the\nlanterns, and that they have broken into the shops of the gunsmiths,\nand seized all the arms they could find. The Duc de Raguse commands the\ntroops, and already several charges have taken place. This selection,\nunder present circumstances, is not considered to be a good one.\n\nThe people are forming barricades in various parts of the town, and\nsome of our servants, who have been out to collect intelligence, assert\nthat no hinderance seems to be opposed to this mischievous measure.\nWhere are the civil authorities during all this commotion? is the\nnatural question that suggests itself to one who knows how in London,\nunder any disturbance, they would oppose themselves to check such\nproceedings. And why, if the civil authorities are too weak to resist\nthe torrent, is there not a sufficient military force to stem it? is\nthe next question that presents itself. No one seems to know where the\nblame lies, but every one foretells a dangerous result from this\nunaccountable state of things.\n\nThe promulgation of the ordonnances which had led to this tumult, ought\nto have been accompanied by a display of force sufficient to maintain\ntheir enactment. If a government _will_ try the hazardous measure of a\n_coup d'état_, it ought to be well prepared to meet the probable\nconsequences.\n\nI feel so little disposed to sleep that, instead of seeking my pillow,\nI occupy myself by noting down my impressions, occasionally looking out\nof my window to catch the sounds that break the stillness of the night.\nThe heat is intense, but the sky is as pure and cloudless as if it\ncanopied a calm and slumbering multitude instead of a waking and\nturbulent one, filled with the most angry emotions.\n\nComtes d'Orsay and Valeski have just returned, and state that they have\nbeen as far as the Place de la Bourse, where they saw a scene of the\nutmost confusion. The populace had assembled there in great force,\narmed with every kind of weapon they could obtain, their arms bared up\nto the shoulders, and the whole of them presenting the most wild and\nmotley appearance imaginable. They had set fire to the Corps-de-Garde,\nthe flames of which spread a light around as bright as day. Strange to\nsay, the populace evinced a perfect good-humour, and more resembled a\nmob met to celebrate a saturnalia than to subvert a monarchy.\n\nComtes d'O---- and V---- were recognised by some of the people, who\nseemed pleased at seeing them. On returning, they passed through the\nRue de Richelieu, which they found in total darkness, all the lanterns\nhaving been broken. Comte d'O---- luckily found his cabriolet in the\nRue de Ménars, where he had left it, not being able to take it farther,\nowing to a portion of the pavement being broken up, and had only time\nto reach the club-house in the Rue de Gramont, in the court of which he\nplaced his cab, before the populace rushed by, destroying every thing\nthey met, among which was the carriage of the Prince Tufiakin. A\nconsiderable number of the members of the club were assembled, a few of\nwhom witnessed, from the balcony on the Boulevart, the burning of the\nchairs placed there, the breaking of the lamps, and other depredations.\n\nSome gentlemen went to the battalion of the guards stationed in front\nof the Prince Polignac's, and suggested to the officer in command the\npropriety of sending a few men to arrest the progress of the\ninsurgents, a thing then easily to be accomplished; but the officer,\nhaving no orders, declined to take any step, and the populace continued\ntheir depredations within three hundred yards of so imposing a force as\na battalion of the guards!\n\nWhat may not to-morrow's sun witness, ere it goes down? But conjecture\nis vain in a crisis in which every thing appears to go on in a mode so\nwholly unaccountable. The exhibition of a powerful force might and\nwould, I am persuaded, have precluded the collision that has occurred\nbetween the populace and the military. Blood has been shed on both\nsides, and this has rendered the breach between people and sovereign\ntoo wide to be repaired except by something almost miraculous, and\nalas! the time of miracles is past.\n\nI cannot help wondering at the calmness I feel on this occasion. I\nexperience no personal alarm; but I am apprehensive for my friends,\nsome of whom are deeply interested in this struggle. How may their\ndestinies, lately so brilliant, be overclouded by the change that\nmenaces to take place!\n\nWell may Monsieur Salvandy have observed at the ball so recently given\nby the Duc of Orléans to the royal families of France and Naples, \"This\nmay be termed a Neapolitan _fête_, for they are dancing over a\nvolcano.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\n\nAll now seems quiet, so I will go to bed. Heaven only knows if\nto-morrow night we may be allowed to seek our pillows in safety.\n\n_28th_.--My _femme-de-chambre_ undrew my curtains this morning, \"with\nsuch a face--so faint, so spiritless, so dull, so dead in look, so\nwoe-begone\"--proclaiming that barricades had been erected during the\nnight, and that the bodies of those killed in the encounter yesterday\nhave been paraded through the streets in order to excite still more the\nangry feelings of the people. This last measure reminds one of the\nappalling exhibitions in the fearful and memorable Revolution of former\ndays; and the reminiscences it awakens are not calculated to\ntranquillize the mind.\n\nShe states that the shops are all closed, and that no provisions can be\nobtained; the cook complains that his stockpots want replenishing; and\nthe _femme de charge_ hints that the larder is not so well supplied as\nit would have been had she known what was to occur. Each and all of\nthese functionaries seem wholly occupied by the dread of not being able\nto furnish us with as copious repasts as usual, unmindful that a mighty\nthrone is tottering to its foundation, and that a struggle is going on\nin which many lives may be sacrificed.\n\nThe Duc de Raguse has incurred great blame for his intercourse with the\nsupposed leaders of the Revolution. This conduct has had the effect of\ndestroying the confidence of the troops in their chief, and of\nweakening their attachment to the cause they were to support. The\nMaréchal was the Commandant appointed by the King, and as such, bound\nto treat as rebels those who opposed themselves to his government;\ninstead of which, he seemed more like the _confident_ of a party who,\nit is alleged, owe their victory to his supineness.\n\nThe Duc de Guiche has not left his post, near the royal family, since\nthe 26th, except to pass and repass with instructions from the King to\nthe Duc de Raguse, twice or thrice a-day. He has been repeatedly\nrecognised by the people, though in plain clothes, and experienced at\ntheir hands the respect so well merited by his honourable conduct and\ndevotion to his sovereign. How often have I heard this noble-minded man\ncensured for encouraging the liberal sentiments of the Dauphin; and\nheard this, too, from some of those who are now the first to desert\nCharles the Tenth in the emergency which is the result of the system\nthey advocated!\n\n---- has been here; he tells me that to Marshal Marmont the king has\nconfided unlimited power, and that Paris has been declared in a state\nof siege.\n\nHe says that the military dispositions are so defective, that there is\nnot a young officer in the army capable of committing a similar\nmistake. The regiments are crowded into narrow streets, in which even\nchildren may become dangerous enemies, by throwing from the windows\nevery missile within their reach on the heads of the soldiers. He is of\nopinion that, in twenty-four hours, the populace will be in possession\nof Paris. The tri-coloured flag is now floating from the towers of\nNotre-Dame; while the white flag of the luckless Bourbons, as often\nstained by the faithlessness of its followers, as by the blood of its\nfoes, still waves from the column of the Place Vendôme,--that column\nerected to commemorate the glory of the great chief now calmly sleeping\nin his ocean-washed grave.\n\nThe civil authorities seem paralyzed: the troops have been twelve hours\non duly without any refreshment, except that afforded by the humanity\nof the people, who have brought them wine and bread; can it be hoped\nthat these same soldiers will turn their arms against those who have\nsupplied their necessities?\n\nThe royal emblems are destroyed wherever they are found, and the bust\nof the king has been trampled on. The disgusting exhibition of the dead\nbodies has had the bad effect calculated upon, and all is tumult and\ndisorder. Every one wonders where are the authorities, and why a\nsufficient military force does not appear, for there has been ample\ntime, since the disposition to insurrection manifested by the people,\nto assemble the troops.\n\nEvery visitor, and, notwithstanding the disturbed state of Paris, we\nhave already had several to-day, announces some fresh disaster, each\nrepresenting it according to the political creed to which he adheres.\nThe Royalists assert that the outbreak is the result of a long and\ngrave conspiracy, fomented by those who expect to derive advantage from\nit; while the Liberals maintain that it has arisen spontaneously and\nsimultaneously from the wounded spirit of liberty, lashed into a\nfrenzied resistance by the ordonnances. I pretend not to know which of\nthese statements is the most correct; but I believe that the favourite\nopinion of the worthy Sir Roger de Coverley, that \"much could be said\non both sides of the question,\" might now fairly be urged; for,\naccording to the march of events, it is but too probable that the\nmelodrama now enacting before our eyes has not been an impromptu; and\nit is quite clear that the ordonnances have furnished the occasion, and\nthe excuse (if such were required), for the performance.\n\nWell might a great Italian writer pronounce revolutions to be the\ncarnivals of history. This one seems to be not only a carnival but\nSaturnalia, for the ebriety of the slaves of liberty is well calculated\nto disgust the friends; and those who witness this intoxication are\nreminded of the observation of Voltaire, that \"_Les Français goûtent de\nla liberté comme des liqueurs fortes avec lesquelles ils s'enivrent.\"_\nA revolution affected by physical instead of moral force, is a grave\nwound inflicted on social order and civilization--a wound which it\ntakes ages to heal.\n\nWhen on the point of sitting down to our _déjeûner a la fourchette_\n(for people will eat while thrones are crumbling), repeated knockings,\nat the _porte-cochère_ induced us to look from the window in order to\nsee who the persons were who thus loudly demanded admittance, when it\nwas discovered that they were Doctors Pasquier and De Guise. They had\nbeen dressing the wounded at the hospital in the Faubourg du Roule, and\nfinding on their return that the Champs-Élysées and Rue St.-Honoré were\nthe scenes of combat, had bethought themselves of our vicinity, and\nsought shelter. When our unexpected visitants, deeming themselves\nfortunate in having found a refuge, prepared to join our repast, it was\nludicrous to observe the lengthened faces of our servants at this\naddition to our party. They, having previously lamented the paucity of\nprovisions in the larder, and being aware of the difficulty, if not\nimpossibility, of procuring a further supply, looked on the new-comers\nas interlopers, who would inevitably diminish the already too limited\nstock.\n\nWe had not been seated above five minutes at table, when the report of\nfire-arms announced that hostilities were renewed, and we hurried to\nthe drawing-room to observe what was going on. The servants looked as\nif they rather enjoyed the interruption to the morning's meal, thinking\nno doubt that it would preserve the provisions, now so precious in\ntheir eyes, and they prepared to remove the viands with unusual\nalacrity; but their visages lengthened when told to let them remain on\nthe table, and became still longer when we shortly after resumed our\nplaces at the board.\n\nAn Englishwoman, in the kitchen establishment, has just performed a\nfeat that has elevated her into a heroine in the eyes of the rest of\nthe servants. Finding the larder not sufficiently supplied, she sallied\nforth into the street, passed through the Rue St.-Honoré, while the\nfighting was going on, and returned bearing a basket of meat, obtained\ncertainly at the risk of her life, as shots were flying around her. As\nnone of the men offered to undertake this action, she is now considered\nlittle less than an amazon, and her _amour-propre_ being excited by the\ncommendations bestowed on her courage, she declares that she will go\nforth for all that may be required, as she despises fear.\n\nWe have now entrenched ourselves in the front drawing-rooms, with the\nexternal shutters, which are stuffed to exclude noise, closed, but\nwhich we open occasionally, in order to see what is going on. Sitting\nin darkness, with the sound of firing, and the shouts of the people,\ncontinually in our ears, I can hardly bring myself to think that all\nthat is now passing is not a dream.\n\nThe populace, ten minutes ago, rushed from the Rue St.-Honoré towards\nthe Champs-Élysées, assailing the troops stationed in the latter place;\nand were in turn assailed by these last, and forced to retreat to the\nRue St.-Honoré. The scene was one of the utmost confusion.\n\nThe firing is going on; stragglers are rushing to and fro; a body of\ntroops are stationed at the bottom of this street, and some pieces of\ncannon have been placed. A thousand rumours are afloat, each more\nimprobable than the other. One moment it is announced that several\nregiments have fraternized with the people; another, that the royal\nfamily have fled to Belgium; the next, that Paris is to be fired by the\ninsurgents; but it would be impossible to repeat one-half the wild\nrumours in circulation.\n\nThere is a mixture of the sublime and of the ridiculous in the scenes\nnow passing before my eyes that is quite extraordinary. Looking from my\nwindow, twenty minutes ago, I saw a troop of boys, amounting to about\nfifty, the eldest of whom could not be more than ten or eleven years\nold, and some who appeared under that age, march through our streets,\nwith wooden swords, and lances pointed with sharp nails, flags flying,\nand crying, \"_Vive la charte! Vive la liberté_!\" The gravity and\nintrepidity of these _gamins de Paris_ would, at any other period, have\nelicited a smile; but now, this demonstration on the part of mere\nchildren creates the reflection of how profound and general must be the\nsympathy enlisted against the government and the sovereign in the\nhearts of the people.\n\nMany are those who, like their children, shout \"_Vive la charte!_\" and\n\"_Vive, la liberté!_\" who are as ignorant of the true sense and value\nof both as they are. Well might the victim, when being led to execution\nin the days of the past revolution in France, exclaim, \"O Liberty, what\ncrimes are committed in thy name!\"\n\nOne of our servants has this moment informal me that the children,\nwhose warlike demeanour I was disposed to smile at an hour ago, have\nrendered (_not_ the state, but the popular cause) some service. The\ntroops, more amused than surprised at the appearance of these mimic\nsoldiers, suffered them to approach closer than prudence warranted, and\nthe urchins, rushing among the horses, wounded several of the poor\nanimals severely, and effected their retreat before the soldiers were\naware of what had occurred.\n\nA fatality seems to prevail in the preset crisis that is little less\nthan marvellous. A want of provisions for the troops is now added to\nthe catalogue of excitements against the cause of royalty. Harassed by\nthe repeated attacks of the populace, and exhausted by long exposure to\nthe intense heat of a burning sun, they are little prone to consider as\nenemies those who approach them with food to allay the pangs of hunger,\nand drink to cool their scorching thirst. ----, and others who have\nmingled with the crowd, tell me that they have beheld repeated examples\nof soldiers throwing down their arms, to embrace those who came to\nseduce them with the most irresistible of all seductions--refreshment,\nwhen they were nearly exhausted by the want of it.\n\nI shall begin to consider myself half a heroine, after an exploit I\nperformed this evening. The men who shared our dinner having gone out\nto observe what was passing, I determined, _coûte que coûte_, to pay a\nvisit to my friend Madame Craufurd. I attired myself as simply as\npossible, and, attended by a _valet de pied_, sallied forth. Having\ntraversed the short distance that separates this house from the Rue\nSt.-Honoré, I arrived at the barricade erected in front of the entrance\nto the Rue Verte, and I confess this obstacle seemed to me, for the\nfirst minute or two that I contemplated it, insurmountable. My servant,\ntoo, expressed his belief of the difficulty, if not impossibility, of\nclimbing over this mountain of loose stones, that I felt half disposed\nto retrace my steps.\n\nThe shouts of a mob approaching along the Rue St.-Honoré quickly\ndecided me on the course to pursue; I clambered up as best I could, not\nwithout considerable risk; nor was the danger and difficulty of the\ndescent on the other side of this rude pyramid less imminent. The\nevening was more sultry than I ever experienced an evening to be, even\nin Italy; the houses were all closed, the streets deserted, except when\na few occasional stragglers rushed along, glancing at me with surprise,\nand uttering their comments on my courage. Now and then a dog ran by,\nwith a terrified air and drooping tail, keeping close to the houses as\nif for protection. One might have fancied oneself in some city ravaged\nby the plague, and the burning heat of the atmosphere, and lurid red of\nthe clouds, might have strengthened the notion.\n\nIt more than once occurred to me how singular it was for me, a woman\nand a stranger, to find myself with only one attendant in the streets,\non foot, in a city declared to be in a state of siege, and with the\nnoise of firing in the distance, and the shouts of the populace,\ncontinually breaking on my ears.\n\nHaving passed the Rue de la Ville-l'Évêque, and entered the Rue\nd'Anjou, I soon reached the _porte-cochère_ of my friend. My servant\nknocked, and very loudly, but before the Swiss porter would open the\ndoor, he reconnoitred from the window in the _entresol_ of his lodge.\nHe could hardly credit his eyes when he saw me; and while he unbolted\nand unchained the door, an operation which took him more time than I\nthought necessary, I could hear him muttering that, \"_Les dames\nAnglaises n'ont peur de rien, positivement rien_.\" I was not sorry when\nI heard the massive door closed after me, with its bolts and chains\nagain secured; but, as I crossed the courtyard, the different aspect of\nthe house, with its closed windows, reminded me so forcibly of the\nchange that had occurred since my last visit, only three days\npreviously, that I felt more agitated than while traversing the\nstreets.\n\nWhen I entered the drawing-room, in which a large circle were\nassembled, Madame Craufurd, though the servants announced my name,\ncould hardly believe I was indeed come. She wept bitterly while\nembracing me, and observed on the hardship of a person so aged as\nherself being called on to witness two revolutions. All the horrors of\nthe first are recalled vividly to her mind, and her terror of what may\noccur is proportioned to what she remembers to have formerly taken\nplace. Nothing seemed to pacify her terror so much as the fact of my\nhaving been permitted to pass unmolested to her house, though she\nconsidered me little less than insane to have undertaken the task.\n\n\"For myself,\" said Madame C----, \"I have little fear (though her\nblanched cheek and trembling hand told another story); but for those\ndearer to me than life, what have I not to dread? You who know the\nchivalrous sentiments of the Duc de Guiche, and the attachment\nentertained by him and my granddaughter for the royal family, will\nunderstand how much I have to dread for them from the vengeance which\ntheir devotion to their sovereign may draw on their heads. _They_ are\nnot, as you are aware, time-servers, like so many others, who will\ndesert their king in his hour of need. No; they will brave death, I am\nassured, rather than forsake in adversity those whose prosperity they\nshared.\"\n\nThe marquis d'Aligre, one of, it not the, richest landed proprietors in\nFrance, was among the circle at Madame Craufurd's, and evinced no\nlittle composure and courage in the circumstances in which we found\nourselves. He joined me in endeavouring to soothe her fears; and\nprobably the fact of his having so immense a stake to risk in the\ncrisis now taking place, added not a little weight to the arguments he\nurged to quiet her alarms. When people have so much to lose, their\ncalmness has an imposing effect; and the rhetoric of the most\naccomplished orator would have probably been less successful than was\nthe composed manner of the marquis d'Aligre, in restoring the wonted\ncourage of our amiable hostess.\n\nWhen I rose to take leave, Madame C---- tried all her efforts to\npersuade me to remain to sleep at her house, and I had no little\ndifficulty to escape from her importunity. She would fain send all her\nmen servants to escort me home, and the Marquis d'Aligre also\npressingly offered his services; but I was obstinate in my refusal to\nallow anyone to accompany me, being convinced that there was even less\ndanger in proceeding with a single servant than more numerously\nattended. I tore myself from the embraces of Madame C----, whose tears\nflowed afresh, and bedewed my cheeks, and I once more passed through\nthe court-yard, followed to the porter's lodge by the _dames de\ncompagnie, femmes de chambre_, and _valets de chambre_, wondering at my\ncourage, offering up their prayers for my safety, and proclaiming that\nonly an Englishwoman would have faced such danger. The old Swiss porter\nwould not risk opening the gate until he had assured himself, from the\nwindow, that the coast was clear, and closed it so rapidly when I had\npassed it as almost to have endangered my heels.\n\nOn returning, I found a cord drawn across the street in front of the\nbarrack in the Rue Verte, and some forty or fifty ill-dressed and\nriotous men assembled, half-a-dozen of whom held the cord. Having\napproached close to it, I paused, and, looking calmly at those who held\nit, I appealed by looks to their politeness. Some of them laughed\naloud, and asked me if I could not leap over the barrier that impeded\nmy progress, drawing the rope still higher while they spoke. I\nanswered, though I trembled at being exposed to their rude mirth, and\nstill more rude gaze, \"That I felt sure Frenchmen would not compel me\nto such an unfeminine exertion, or give me cause to tell my compatriots\nwhen I returned to England that deference to women no longer existed in\nFrance.\"\n\n\"Let her pass! let her pass!\" exclaimed nearly all the voices of the\ngroup; \"she is courageous, and she speaks rightly, _Vivent les\nAnglaises! Vivent les Anglaises!_\" and the cord was instantly lowered\nto the ground, and I hastily stepped over it, glad to get out of\nhearing of the rough compliments bestowed on me.\n\nMy servant had attempted to address them before I spoke, but they one\nand all assailed him with a torrent of reproach, demanding if he was\nnot ashamed to wear a livery, the badge of servitude, when all his\ncountrymen were fighting for their liberty. I had again to clamber over\nthe barricade, assisted by my servant, and, before I could cross the\nRue St.-Honoré, encountered various groups of men rushing along, all of\nwhom uttered such invectives against my footman that I determined not\nagain to go out attended by this symbol of aristocracy.\n\nOn reaching my home, the porter observed, with a self-complacency his\nprudence could not conceal, that he \"knew Madame la Comtesse had\nnothing to dread from the people, they were brave and _bons enfans_,\nand would not injure a lady;\"--a commendation that clearly indicated\nthe state of his feelings.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\n\nI have observed a striking change in the manners of the servants during\nthe last three days. They are more familiar, without, however, evincing\nthe least insolence; their spirits seem unusually exhilarated, and they\nbetray an interest in the struggle in which the people are engaged that\nleaves no doubt as to the side that excites their sympathy. Every\nrumour of the success of the insurgents is repeated by them with\nill-suppressed animation and pleasure, and the power of the people is\nexaggerated far beyond the bounds of truth. I confess this folly on\ntheir part annoys me, and the more especially as the class to which\nthey belong, are totally incapacitated by ignorance from being able to\ncomprehend even the causes alleged for this popular outbreak.\n\nMisguided men! can they hope that servitude will be lightened by their\nbeing employed by some _parvenus_, elevated from the dregs of the\npeople by a revolution which sets floating to the top the worst\ningredients of the reeking caldron from which it is formed, instead of\nowning the more gentle and infinitely less degrading sway of those born\nto, and accustomed to rule?\n\nComte ---- and ---- have just come in, and report that the last story\ncurrent is, that fifty thousand men from Rouen are marching to Paris to\nespouse the cause of the _people_. They say there is no end to the\ndesertions among the troops.\n\nThe people--the people! I hear of nothing but the people; but those who\nspeak of them as all and every thing, seem to me to mistake the\npopulace for the people, yet surely the words are not synonymous. The\npeople, according to my acceptation of the word, are the sober and\nrespectable portion of the community of all countries, including the\nhusbandmen who till the earth, and the artisans who fabricate the\nobjects applicable to our positive wants, and superfluous luxuries. How\ndifferent are these from the populace who fill the streets shouting for\nliberty, by which they mean license; fighting for a charter of the real\nmeaning of which they are ignorant; and rendering themselves the blind\ninstruments by which a revolution is to be accomplished, that will\nleave them rather worse off than it found them; for when did those who\nprofit by such events remember with gratitude the tools by which it was\neffected?\n\n_Thursday_.--Repeated knocking at the gate drew me to the window ten\nminutes ago. The intruder presented a strange mixture of the terrible\nand the ridiculous, the former predominating. Wearing only his shirt\nand trousers, both stained with gore, and the sleeves of the former\nturned up nearly to the shoulder, a crimson handkerchief was bound\nround his head, and another encircled his waist. He brandished a huge\nsword with a black leather string wound round his wrist, with one hand,\nwhile with the other he assailed the knocker. Hearing the window\nopened, he looked up, and exclaimed, \"Ah! madame, order the gate to be\nopened, that I may lay at the feet of my generous master the trophies I\nhave won with this trusty sword,\" waving the said sword over his head,\nand pointing to a pair of silver-mounted pistols and a sabre that he\nhad placed on the ground while he knocked at the gate.\n\nI recognised in this man a helper in the stables of Comte A. d'Orsay,\nof whom it had a short time previously been reported to us, that when a\nparty of the populace had attempted to force the gate of the stable\noffices, which are situated in the Rue Verte, and the English grooms\nand coachman were in excessive alarm, this man presented himself at the\nwindow, sword in hand, declaring that he, though engaged in the same\ncause as themselves, would defend, to the last moment of his life, the\nhorses of his master, and the Englishmen whom he considered to be under\nhis protection. This speech elicited thunders of applause from the\ncrowd who retreated, leaving the alarmed servants, whose protector he\nhad avowed himself, impressed with the conviction that he is little\nshort of a hero.\n\nThis man--these same servants, only a few days ago, looked on as the\nstable drudge, who was to perform all the dirty work, while they,\nattired in smart liveries, and receiving triple the wages given to him,\nwere far more ornamental than useful in the establishment of their\nemployer. They offered him money as a reward for his spirited conduct\n(the English of all classes, but more especially of that to which they\nappertain, think that money pays all manner of debts), but he\nindignantly refused the proffered gift. This revolutionary hero had\nbeen fighting for several hours to-day, and is said to have evinced a\ncourage and enthusiasm that remind one of all we read of the spirit of\nthe old Imperial Guard, when animated by the presence of their mighty\nchief.\n\n---- has just brought the intelligence, that the Tuileries and the\nLouvre are taken by the people! Comte A. d'O---- sent two of his\nservants (Brement, formerly drill-serjeant in the Guards, and now his\nporter, and Charles who was an hussar, and a brave soldier) to the\nTuileries to endeavour to save the portrait of the Dauphin by Sir\nThomas Lawrence--an admirable picture. His instructions as to its\n_emplacement_ were so correct, that the servants found it instantly,\nbut torn in pieces, and the fragments strewed on the floor.\n\nThese men report that even in this feat a strange mixture of the\nterrible and the comic was exhibited, for _while_ a dead body was\nplaced on the throne of Charles the Tenth, some men appeared in the\nwindows of the palace attired in the gold and silver tissue dresses of\nthe Duchesse de Berri, with feathers and flowers in their heads, and\nfans in their hands, which they waved to the multitude beneath, with\nall the coquettish airs and graces of _would-be-fine_ ladies.\n\nThe busts of Charles the Tenth were broken and trampled upon; the\nwardrobes of the royal family were scattered, torn, and thrown among\nthe people, who seemed to regard them only as trophies of the victory\nthey had achieved, and not for their intrinsic value.\n\nThe palace of the Archbishop of Paris has been sacked, and every object\nin it demolished. ---- told me that the ribaldry and coarse jests of\nthe mob on this occasion were disgusting beyond measure; and that they\nceased not to utter the most obscene falsehoods, while they wreaked\ntheir vengeance on the property of this venerable prelate, against whom\nthey can bring no charge, except the suspicion of jesuitical\nprinciples, and of having encouraged the king to issue the ordonnances.\n\n---- and ---- have just been here. They state that Charles the Tenth\nsent a deputation to the provisional government offering to withdraw\nthe ordonnances, and to form a new ministry. The offer came too late,\nand was rejected. Concessions from the vanquished are seldom valued;\nand to offer terms to those who are now in the position to dictate them\nis as unavailing as it is undignified. ---- and ---- say that the\ngeneral opinion is, that if the Duchesse de Berri was now to present\nherself, with her son, to the people, her popularity, and his youth and\ninnocence, would accomplish an event that would satisfy most parties;\nnamely, the calling of the Duc de Bordeaux to the throne. The Duchesse\nde Berri has courage enough to take this step; what a pity it is that\nshe has not wisdom enough to adopt it!\n\nWhile the fighting was going on in the streets, ---- and ---- met our\nambassador, Lord Stuart de Rothesay, walking along as usual. The\nsecretaries and _attachés_, too, of the English embassy have been\ncontinually seen in places where their presence evinced more courage\nand curiosity than caution; but fear is, I firmly believe, an unknown\nguest in the breast of English gentlemen.\n\nComte ---- has just been here; he has been to the Collége of Ste.-Barbe\nto take charge of the sons of the Duc de Guiche, in order to conduct\nthem to the country; a service of no little danger, as all connected\nwith the court, and known to be faithful to the royal family are liable\nto be maltreated. How painful and trying a part is the Duc de Guiche\nnow called on to act: compelled to leave his wife and family in a town\nin a state of siege, or to desert the monarch to whom he has sworn\nfealty! But he will perform it nobly; and if Charles the Tenth had many\nsuch men to rally round him in the present hour, his throne might still\nbe preserved.\n\nThe Duchesse de Guiche, in the trying situation in which she finds\nherself, has displayed a courage worthy of olden times. The devotion of\nher husband and self to the royal family is so well known that their\nhouse has been a marked one during the last three days, the mob\nrepeatedly stopping before the gate uttering cries and menaces. All her\nfriends have urged her to leave Paris, and to remove with her children\nto the country, for she would not consent to seek an asylum with her\ngrandmother or brother; urging, as a reason, that, in the absence of\nthe Duc, she felt it her duty to remain, that her presence might induce\nthe household to a more strict discharge of theirs, in protecting the\nproperty of the Dauphin.\n\n---- and ---- have been here, and have told us that the provisional\ngovernment were installed in the Hôtel-de-Ville, General La Fayette at\nits head, and my old acquaintance Monsieur Alexandra de Laborde taking\nan active part. How all this is to end I cannot imagine; the cry for a\nrepublic, though strongly echoed, will, I think, be unavailing; and the\nreasonable part of the community cannot desire that it should be\notherwise, inasmuch as the tyranny of the many must ever be more\ninsupportable than that of one, admitting that even a despotic monarchy\ncould in our day exercise a tyranny, which I am not disposed to admit.\n\nThe tri-coloured flag now floats on many of the churches, while that of\nthe _Fleur-de-lis_ still waves from the column in the Place Vendôme, on\nother public buildings, and the Tuileries. What a strange state of\nthings! but every thing is strange in this eventful crisis.\n\n---- has just been here, and reports that yesterday a meeting of the\nDeputies took place at the house of M. Casimir Périer, in order to\nconsult on what measures they ought to pursue in the present state of\naffairs. He says, that pusillanimity, and want of decision consequent\non it, marked the conduct of the assembly. They lost the time, so\nprecious in a crisis like the actual one, in disputing about words,\nwhen deeds ought to have been had recourse to. They are accused of\nbeing influenced by a dread of offending the now tottering power, lest\nit should once more be solidly reinstated, and yet of being anxious to\nremain well with those opposed to it; and they are said to have\ntemporised with both, allowing the time for serving either to have\npassed away.\n\nA bitter feeling towards the royal family seems to pervade the minds of\nthe populace; and this has been fomented by the most gross and\ndisgusting falsehoods dispensed around by the medium of obscene\n_brochures_, and songs which are sung and distributed through the\nstreets. Even now beneath my window two men are offering, and crying\naloud, the Amours of the Duchesse d'Angoulême and the Archbishop of\nParis. The most spotless woman in France and the most devout man! The\nsame hand that would pull down the throne would raze the altar!\n\n---- and ---- have been among the fighting, and report wonders of the\nbravery of the populace. They fight with an enthusiasm and courage\nworthy of a better cause, and have evinced a humanity to their wounded\nadversaries that elicits admiration even from those who are the most\nopposed to the cause they have espoused. The citizens, and the women\ntoo, have come forth from the sanctuaries of their dwellings to dress\nthe wounds, and administer refreshment to the combatants, without\ndistinction with regard to the side on which they were engaged.\n\nThis amalgamation of soldiers and people has been destructive to the\ncause of royalty, for the humanity experienced has induced the former\nto throw down their arms rather than use them against generous foes,\nand cries of \"_Vive la Ligne_!\" are often heard from those so lately\nopposed to it. All parties agree in stating that not a single example\nof pillage, except in the instances of the gunsmiths' shops, has\noccurred. Various houses have been entered by the people for the\npurpose of firing from the windows; and, having effected their object,\nthey have retired without taking a single article of the many tempting\nones scattered around in these dwellings.\n\nThis revolution, if indeed the result should prove it to be such, will\noffer a striking contrast to that fearful one that has ever since left\nso black a stain on France, and Frenchmen. Heroic courage, great\nhumanity, and a perfect freedom from cupidity, are the peculiar\nattributes that mark those who are now subverting the throne of the\nBourbons; what a pity it is that such qualities should not have found a\nbetter cause for developing themselves!\n\n_29th_.--The subject now circulated and believed is, that Lafayette and\nhis followers have placed themselves at the head of the people. This\nrumour has quieted the fears of many, for his name exercises a great\ninfluence. The fighting is still going on, and the report of the guns\ncomes booming on the ear continually.\n\nHearing a noise in the street, ten minutes ago, I looked forth, and\nbeheld some four or five men covered with stains of blood, their faces\nblackened by gunpowder, and streaming with perspiration, endeavouring\nto draw away a piece of cannon, of which they had taken possession in\nthe Champs-Élysées. Hearing the opening of my window, they entreated\nme, if there were any men in the house, to send them to their\nassistance, in order to draw away the gun from the reach of the enemy.\n\"And if there are no men,\" continued the speaker, \"let the women come\nout and help us in the good cause.\" While they yet spoke, a party of\nsoldiers were seen rushing to the rescue of the gun, and its temporary\nconquerors were compelled to make a rapid retreat towards the Rue\nSt.-Honoré.\n\nThe name of M. Laffitte is now mixed with that of Lafayette among the\ncrowds in the streets, and has a great effect on them. His vast wealth,\nand the frequent and extensive aid it has afforded to the working\nclasses, have rendered him one of, if not the most popular man in\nParis: so that those most conversant with the actual state of affairs,\npronounce that with Lafayette and Laffitte now rest the destiny of\nFrance. How strange is the alteration which has occurred within so\nshort a space of time! Five days ago, Charles the Tenth reigned in the\nTuileries; at present, on Lafayette and Laffitte it depends whether he\never enters his palace again! The tocsin is now sounding! How\nstrangely, how awfully it strikes on the ear! All this appears like a\ndream.\n\nThe formation of a provisional government is to-day spoken of. The cry\nof \"_Vive Napoleon!_\" has been heard repeatedly shouted from one mass\nof people, while \"_Vive la république!_\" has been as loudly vociferated\nby another. Various persons connected with both the royalist and\npopular party, have been here to-day, so that I hear the opinions\nentertained by the adherents of both sides of the question. Which to\ncredit I know not: there is but one point on which both agree, and that\nis in praising the bravery and forbearance of the people.\n\nWhen I look around on the precious objects that cover the tables,\nconsoles, and cabinets in the salon where I am now writing, and reflect\nthat these same people are not only in arms, but I may say masters of\nthe town, I cannot help wondering at their total avoidance of pillage\nwhen such rich booties might be so easily acquired. Perhaps there is no\nEuropean city in which so many and such splendid collections of rare\nand precious articles are to be found, as at Paris. In England, our\nnobility possess equal treasures, but they are contained in their\ncountry seats; whereas it is in the Parisian dwellings of the French\nnoblesse, that their valuable possessions of rare objects are to be\nfound, and at the present crisis, how soon could an armed mass seize\nthem!\n\n_28th_.--The Duchesse de Guiche was exposed to considerable danger to\nday, and evinced a courage nearly allied to temerity in speaking her\nsentiments on the occasion. Alarmed for the safety of her eldest son,\nshe was proceeding to his college in search of him, when she was\nstopped by a vast crowd of people assembled around the house of one of\nthe tradespeople of the royal family, over whose door were the arms of\nFrance.\n\nThe frightened tradesman was in the act of removing this badge, of\nwhich only a few days previously he had been so proud, when the\nduchesse, seeing him so employed, remarked aloud, that \"after having so\noften solicited permission to place the royal arms over his door, he\nought to have had the courage to defend them.\" The populace, enraged at\nthis reproof, hissed and yelled; but seeing that she remained unmoved,\nthe greater number cheered her, exclaiming \"that young woman is as\ncourageous as she is beautiful; let us shew her that we know how lo\nvalue courage, and protect her to her home,\" They placed themselves\naround her, and with every mark of respect, escorted her, to the gate\nof her dwelling.\n\nA person among the crowd who witnessed this incident, told me that\nnever had he seen the Duchesse de Guiche look so dazzlingly beautiful,\nas when she was reproving the tradesman--her tall and majestic figure\nelevated even above its usual height by the indignation she experienced\nat the insult offered to the royal family, to whom in these their days\nof trial, she is even more chivalrously devoted than when they reigned\nwith undisputed sway, and thousands of those who now desert, professed\nto worship them.\n\nBefore the duchesse regained her abode, she encountered several\nskirmishing parlies in the streets who were absolutely fighting, and\nprobably owed her safety lo the protection afforded her by those whom\nher courage had won to be her champions.\n\nThe intelligence reached us two hours ago, that the populace had\nattacked the hotel of the Duc de Guiche, and placed two pieces of\ncannon before the gate. My terror may more easily be imagined than\ndescribed, for the duchesse and her youngest children are in the house,\nand the duc is with the royal family. I hardly knew whether to be\nthankful or sorry, that her brother Count Alfred d'Orsay was not at\nhome when this news reached us, for he would certainly have proceeded\nto her house, and would probably have, by his presence and\ninterference, rendered her danger still greater.\n\nFearful of compromising the safety of her children, the duchesse left\nthe hotel by another gate, opening into the Rue de Montaigne, and is, I\ntrust, ere this, safe on her route to St.-Germain, where her\nfather-in-law, the Duc de Gramont, has a residence.\n\nHow like a troubled dream all this appears! Would that it were but a\ndream, and that those whom I so much love, were not exposed to pay\ndearly for their fidelity to a sovereign, whose measures their\nenlightened minds are the last to approve, but whose misfortunes, if\nthey cannot ameliorate, they will at least share!\n\nI know not a more painful position than that of the Duc and Duchesse de\nGuiche, at the present moment. With highly cultivated minds and liberal\nopinions, possessing a knowledge of the world, and of the actual state\nof public opinion in France, they must be aware of the utter\nhopelessness of the cause in which they find themselves embarked, yet\nsuch is their chivalrous sentiments of honour, that they will sacrifice\nevery thing rather than abandon those whose prosperity they have\npartaken, and thus incur all the penalty of the acts of a government\nwhose policy they did not approve. Had Charles the Tenth many such\ndevoted adherents, he would not find himself deserted in his hour of\nneed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\n\nI have but just returned from the Rue d'Anjou, and now that I find\nmyself once more within the sanctuary of my home, I am surprised at my\nown courage in having ventured to pass through the streets, and\n_alone_, too, at such a moment. I do not think I should have risked it,\nhad I not known how much my excellent friend Madame C---- stood in need\nof consolation, after having seen her grandchildren and great\ngrandchildren driven from their late peaceful and happy dwelling,\nuncertain when she may behold them again, as they have determined on\nnot forsaking the royal family.\n\nI had ascended nearly to the top of the barricade at the entrance to\nthe Rue Verte when a head and shoulders rose from the opposite side so\nsuddenly as to alarm me not a little. My trepidation was infinitely\nincreased when I discovered that the individual to whom the said head\nand shoulders appertained, was in a state of extreme intoxication, and\nwhen with rolling eyes, flushed checks, and thick articulation he\naddressed me with a familiarity, yet good nature, that I would most\nwillingly have dispensed with.\n\n\"Give me your hand, _ma belle_, fear nothing, I am one of the _bons\nenfans_ of the revolution, take my arm and no one will molest you. We,\n_les braves des braves_, wage no war against women; _au contraire_, we\nlove the pretty creatures. Here take my hand, and I will assist you\nover the barricades.\"\n\nSuiting his action to the word, he extended his hand towards me, and\nreaching forward lost his equilibrium and rolled over; at which moment,\nthe proprietor of a wine shop at the corner of the Rue Verte came to my\nassistance, and leading me through his house, opened a door on the\nother side of the barricade, through which I hastily passed, he civilly\noffering to open the same door when I returned if I would knock at it.\nAnd here, _en passant_, let me render justice to the politeness I have\ninvariably experienced from all classes of men, and on all occasions,\nin France--a politeness so general that I should be ungrateful if I did\nnot record it.\n\nWhen I passed the barrack in the Rue Verte, it was in the possession of\nthe people, who had seized it by the right of conquest an hour or two\npreviously. Proud of the achievement, they were looking out of the\nwindows, shouting, singing the Marseillaise, embracing each other, and\nproclaiming that they were _les bons enfans_, etc. They paid me many\nhomely compliments as I passed, but not a single indelicate allusion\nescaped their lips; and I hurried on, not meeting a human being until I\nentered the courtyard of Madame C----'s hotel, into which I found\nconsiderable difficulty to penetrate, owing to the extreme caution of\nher Swiss porter who seemed to think it very dangerous to open even the\nlittle door to admit me.\n\nI found dear, good Madame C---- depressed and agitated. I rejoiced to\nfind that she was ignorant of the scene that took place between her\ngrand-daughter and the populace, for a knowledge of it would have\nserved to increase her alarm. She was surrounded by the usual circle of\n_habitués_ who endeavoured in vain to calm her fears, but my presence\nre-assured her a little, and Count Valeski, who came in soon after,\nsucceeded in mitigating her terror. Having witnessed the horrors of the\nformer revolution, it is no wonder she should tremble at the thoughts\nof another, and she looks on my calmness and courage as little short of\nheroism.\n\nI remained a couple of hours with her, and having resisted all her\npersuasions to induce me to stay all night, I left the Rue d'Anjou, and\nhad reached the Rue Verte, when I heard the report of guns, and saw a\nparty of soldiers attacking the barracks, out of the windows of which\nthe people, who had taken forcible possession of it some hours before,\nwere firing on their assailants. I retraced my steps as hastily as\npossible, fear lending swiftness to my feet, and returned to the Rue de\nMatignon by the Faubourg du Roule and the Rue St.-Honoré. Our trusty\nporter, having heard the shots, and knowing they proceeded from the\n_quartier_ through which my route lay, was much alarmed for my safety,\nand evinced great pleasure when he saw me safe again within the portal\nunder his charge, while I congratulated myself on having once more\nproved my friendship to my dear old friend, by a personal exertion\nentailing no more disagreeable consequences than a temporary alarm.\n\n---- and ---- have just been here: they say that it is reported that a\nnegotiation has been opened between the king and the provisional\ngovernment, and that even still a reconciliation may be effected. I do\nnot believe it, though I wish it were true. The blood that has flowed\nduring the last days has, I fear, created an impassable gulf between\nthe sovereign and the people. Each party has made discoveries fatal to\nthe good understanding necessary to subsist between both: one having\nproved his want of power to carry his wishes into effect, and the other\nhaving but too well evinced its power of resistance.\n\nWhile the negotiations are pending, the royal cause becomes every hour\nmore hopeless. Success has rendered the people less tractable; and the\nconcession implied by the king's holding out terms to them, has less\nchance of producing a favourable result.\n\nThe populace attempted to force an entrance into the _Hôtel des Pages_,\nand, having fired through the iron gate, killed a fine youth, the son\nof General Jacquinot, one of the royal pages, and a protégé of the Duc\nde Guiche. It was of this general that the Emperor Napoleon\nsaid--\"_Celui-là est brave tous les jours, en mon absence comme sous\nmes yeux_.\" It is not more than ten days ago, since I met the mother\nand sister of this promising youth with him at the Duchesse de\nGuiche's. They came to return thanks to her and the duc for the\ngenerous protection they had afforded to him; they were elate with joy\nat his promotion, looked forward to his further advancement, and now--.\nMy heart bleeds for the poor mother who doted on her son!\n\nCount Alfred d'Orsay, having heard that he had no relations in Paris at\nthis moment, has gone to arrange for the interment of this poor youth,\nwho yet scarcely more than a child, has lost his life at but a short\ndistance from the threshold of that door where he had been so often\nreceived with kindness. How glad I am that the duchesse was spared the\nhorror of being so near the scene of this murder, and that she and her\nchildren are safe from the reach of personal violence!\n\nThe interesting countenance of this fine youth, as I lately saw it,\nhaunts me. Beaming with affection towards his mother and sister, and\nwith gratitude towards his friends, it was pleasant to behold it; and\nnow,--how fearful is the change produced in so brief a space! That\nbereaved mother and fond sister will never more look on that face so\ndear;--before the fatal intelligence can have reached them, he will\nhave been consigned to the grave, and will owe to a stranger those last\nrites which they little dream are now performing.\n\nThe number of persons killed during the last three days has excited\nmuch less interest in my feelings than the death of this poor youth. I\ncannot picture to my mind's eye any other distinct image among the\nslain. They present only a ghastly mass, with all the revolting\naccompaniments of gaping wounds and blood-stained garments, I never saw\nthem in life,--knew not the faces that will be steeped in tears, or\nconvulsed in agony at their deaths; but this poor boy, so young, so\nfair, and so beloved, and his fond mother and gentle sister seem ever\nto stand before me!\n\nI remember reading, long years ago, the example given of a person\nrecounting all the details of a great battle, in which hundreds were\nslain, and the listeners hearing the account unmoved, until the relater\ndescribed one individual who had been killed, and drew a vivid picture,\nwhen those who had heard of the death of hundreds without any deeper\nemotion than general pity, were melted to tears. This is my case, with\nregard to the poor young page, cut off in the morning of his life; for,\nhaving his image present to my mind, his death seems more grievous to\nme than that of hundreds whom I have never seen.\n\n_30th_.--The last news is, that the Dauphin has been named\nGeneralissimo, that he has placed himself at the head of the vast body\nof troops that still adhere to their allegiance, and that he is to\nadvance on Paris. This determination has been adopted too late, and can\nnow, in my opinion, avail but little.\n\nComte d'O---- has just returned from seeing the last sad duties paid to\nthe remains of the poor young page. He brings the intelligence that the\nroyal family left St.-Cloud last night, and are now at Versailles. This\nstep proves that they consider their case hopeless. Unhappy Bourbons! a\nfatality seems to impend over the race; and Charles the Tenth appears\ndoomed to die, as he has lived the greater portion of his life, in\nexile. The absence of the Dauphine at this eventful period has been\npeculiarly unfortunate for her family; for, with her firmness of\ncharacter and promptitude of decision, her counsel might have served,\nwhile her presence would have given an impetus to, their cause.\n\nI have just seen ----, who told me, that on the King's departure for\nVersailles he left the Dauphin in command of the troops that still\nadhered to their allegiance, and that the Prince placed himself at the\nhead of a battalion of the _garde royale_, charged the enemy on the\nPont de Sèvres, and took possession of it; but the troops, with the\nexception of a few officers, refused to follow, and left him to receive\nthe fire of the insurgents, which it is wonderful that he escaped. With\nwhat feelings must he have bent his course to Versailles, deserted by\ntroops on whom he had bestowed so many favours and acts of munificence,\nto meet his sovereign and father, with the sad news of their revolt!\n\nI have just had the gratifying intelligence that the Duchesse de Guiche\nand her children reached St.-Germain's in safety. This is a great\nrelief to my mind. The royal arms on the carriage, and the liveries,\nwere recognised at the Barrière, and the populace crowded around, many\nof them expressing their dissatisfaction at beholding these memorials\nof a family so lately respected, if not beloved. It had been\nrepresented to the Duchesse, previously to her leaving Paris, that she\nran no inconsiderable risk in venturing out with the royal arms on her\ncarriage;[9] but she declared that she would not consent to their being\neffaced. She courageously, and with a calm dignity, addressed the angry\ncrowd, explained her sentiments and feelings to them in a few brief\nwords, and they, won by her beauty and noble bearing, even perhaps\nstill more than by her courage (though intrepidity has always a\npeculiar charm for Frenchmen), cheered her, and suffered the carriage\nto proceed unmolested.\n\n\n_July 30th_.--I am again alarmed for the safety of the Duchesse de\nGuiche. The populace having yesterday assembled at the Place\nSt.-Germain, in which is the residence of her father-in-law, the Duc de\nGramont, they evinced so hostile a feeling towards all attached to the\nroyal family, that a friend, becoming apprehensive of violence, scaled\nthe wall of the garden, and entering the house, implored the Duchesse,\nere it was yet too late, to seek safety by flight.\n\nAlarmed for her children--for this noble-minded woman is a stranger to\npersonal fear--she sought refuge with them in the Forest of\nSt.-Germain, in the Château du Val, the abode of the Princesse de Poix,\nwhere she experiences all the kindness and hospitality which her\namiable hostess can practise, in order to soothe the anxiety of her\nguest.\n\nWhat a change in the position of the Duchesse, and in so brief a space!\nA fugitive in that forest where, every year during the _Fête des\nLoges_, she dispensed kindness to the poor, and amiability to all,\ndoing the honours of the Duc de Gramont's house, where her\ncondescension and goodness were the themes of every tongue! And now,\nharassed in mind and body, terrified for the safety of her husband, who\nis with the royal family, and for her two eldest sons, who are in their\ncollege, in the Rue St.-Marceau, which is rendered inaccessible, owing\nto the barricades.\n\n_31st_.--Lafayette is now said to be the oracle of the provisional\ngovernment, and the idol of the populace. Advanced far in the vale of\nlife, his energies and vigour are gone, and his _name_ serves the party\nmore than his counsel can; for with the republicans, at least, it is a\nguarantee for honest motives. What a strange destiny has his\nbeen--called on to perform so conspicuous a part in two revolutions!\n\n---- has just been here, and announced that the Duc d'Orléans is named\nLieutenant-general of France. It is asserted, that this appointment has\nbeen effected by the influence of General Lafayette over the\nprovisional government; but how little in accordance is this measure\nwith the well-known Utopian scheme of a republic, which has for years\nbeen the favourite dream of this venerable visionary?\n\n_August 1st_. ---- now has brought the intelligence that Charles the\nTenth has nominated the Duc d'Orléans Lieutenant-general, so that his\nRoyal Highness has been chosen by both sides--a flattering proof of the\nconfidence reposed in him by each. Were he ambitious, here is an\nopportunity of indulging this \"infirmity of noble minds,\" though at the\nexpense of the elder branch of his family; but he will not, I am sure,\nbetray the trust they have confided to him. Order seems now to be in a\ngreat measure restored; the people appear in good-humour; but there is\na consciousness of power evident in their hilarity that too forcibly\nreminds one of their victory.\n\nThe Duc of Orléans has been to the Hôtel-de-Ville, where he presented\nhimself to the people from the balcony; embraced General Lafayette, who\nstood by his side; and was applauded with enthusiasm by the immense\nmultitude who witnessed the _accolade_.\n\n_2nd_.--The news of the day is, that Charles the Tenth has abdicated\nthe crown in favour of the Duc de Bordeaux, who is now styled Henri V.\nThis act might, four or five days ago, have produced some salutary\neffect; but it now comes too late--at least, so think those who profess\nto know more on the subject than I do. The position of the\nLieutenant-general, in this case, reminds me of that of a _confidante_\nin a quarrel between lovers, in which the interest of the absent is too\noften sacrificed, owing to the dangerous opportunity furnished for\nforwarding that of the supposed friend.\n\n_3d_.--Again, considerable excitement has prevailed in the town,\nproduced by the proclamation, that the dethroned sovereign had\ndetermined to take up his position, with the strong military force that\nstill adheres to him, at Rambouillet. The publicity given to this news\nwas a very injudicious measure, if conciliation, or even forbearance to\nthe deposed family, was desired.\n\nThe populace, that many-headed monster, only seen abroad when evil\npassions dictate violence, again rush through the streets, breathing\nvengeance against the poor old man, whose grey hairs, more exposed by\nthe absence of the crown his _ci-devant_ subjects have wrested from his\nhead, should have claimed more respect at their hands. Truly has the\npoet said,\n\n          \"He who has worn crown,\n     When less than king is less than other men,--\n     A fallen star, extinguish'd, leaving blank\n     Its place in heaven.\"\n\nThis fickle people, or, at least, the dregs of them, for it would be\nunjust to confound all in their enormities, will efface the credit they\nhave gained by the forbearance from crime that has as yet characterised\nthis revolution, by some act of brutality towards the royal family. But\neven the very dregs of the people have not appeared desirous to adopt\nany such course, until excited into it by the wicked rumours set\nafloat, that Charles the Tenth had carried off all the crown jewels--a\nrumour peculiarly calculated to excite their ire and meet a ready\ncredence, each individual of the motley train looking on himself as\nhaving an interest in these national riches, and judging from _self_,\nof the possibility--nay, more, probability, of so vile an action. How\nlittle can such minds identify themselves with the feelings of those\nwho, sated with the gewgaws and trappings of grandeur, forget them in\nthe deep, the powerful excitement of beholding a throne crumbling into\nruin beneath them--a diadem rudely torn from their brows--the power\nthey wielded, even that of doing good, wrested violently, with the\nsceptre, from their hands; and more than all, behold the loved, the\n_trusted_--those on whom they had showered benefits with prodigality,\nturn from them in their hour of need and join their foes!\n\n     \"If thou canst hate, as, oh! that soul must hate\n     Which loves the virtuous and reveres the great;\n     If thou canst loathe and execrate with me\n     That gallic garbage of philosophy,--\n     That nauseous slaver of these frantic times,\n     With which false liberty dilutes her crimes;\n     If thou hast got within thy free-born breast\n     One pulse that beats more proudly than the rest\n     With honest scorn for that inglorious soul\n     Which creeps and winds beneath a mob's control.\n     Which courts the rabble's smile, the rabble's nod,\n     And makes, like Egypt, every beast its God!\"\n\n_August 4th_.--The King has left Rambouillot, alarmed by the report of\nthe approach of the vast multitude who had left, or were leaving,\nParis, with hostile intentions towards the royal family. The scenes\nthat took place then, previously to his departure, are represented as\nbeing most affecting.\n\nAn old man, overpowered by mental and bodily sufferings, remembering\nthe terrible days of a former revolution, brought with a fearful\nvividness to his mind by the appalling change effected within the last\nfew eventful days, he had lost all presence of mind, and with it his\nconfidence in those whom he might have safely trusted, while he yielded\nit to those whose interests were wholly opposed to his. Nor is the\ndeplorable effect produced on his mind by recent events to be wondered\nat.\n\nAdversity is the only school in which monarchs can acquire wisdom, and\nit almost always comes too late to enable them to profit by its bitter\nlessons. The defection of those hitherto supposed to be devoted\nfriends, the altered looks of faces never before beheld without being\ndressed in smiles, the unceremoniousness of courtiers who never\npreviously had dared to have an opinion before royalty had decided what\nit should be, might well have shook firmer nerves, and touched a\nsterner heart, than belonged to the old, grey-headed monarch, who saw\nhimself betrayed without comprehending by whom, and who used his\nauthority as sovereign and father, over his religiously obedient son,\nto extort an abdication of his right, as well as an approval of the\nresignation of his own.\n\nLike another Lear, this poor old man has been driven forth \"to bide the\npelting of the pitiless storm\" of a revolution, followed by his widowed\ndaughter-in-law and her helpless son, that child orphaned ere yet he\nsaw the light, and by Frenchmen who now condemn him to exile!\n\nThey have taken the route to Cherbourg, there to embark; and of those\nwho lately bent the knee before them, how few have followed their now\ngloomy fortunes! One, at least, has not left, and will not forsake\nthem. The Duc de Guiche, the kindest husband and father perhaps in\nFrance, sacrifices his feelings of domestic affection to his sense of\nduty, and accompanies the exiled family!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\n\n_August 5th_.--There are rumours today that the son of the Emperor\nNapoleon will be called to fill the vacant throne. This seems to me to\nbe very improbable, when I reflect that General Lafayette, whose\ninfluence is omnipotent at present, appears wholly devoted to the Duc\nd'Orléans. The minds of the people are as yet wholly unsettled; a dread\nof how their late exploits may be looked on by the foreign powers\nallied to the deposed sovereign, pervades the multitude, and the\nrepublicans begin to discover that their Utopian schemes are little\nlikely to be advanced by the revolution effected.\n\nI was forcibly struck this morning on reading, in an Italian writer,\nthe following passage, which is strongly applicable to the present\ntime:\n\n     \"When a revolution is ripe, men are always found who are\n     ready to commence it, and make their bodies the steps to the\n     throne of him who is to profit by their labours, without\n     having shared their dangers.\"\n\nI have a presentiment that the truth of this axiom will be verified in\nFrance.\n\n_August 6th_.--Reports are now afloat that the crown of France has been\noffered to the Duke of Orléans, but that the offer was not unanimous,\nand that consequently he has not accepted it. Other rumours state, that\nif he should be induced to do so, it will only be to hold it as a\nsacred deposit to be restored to the rightful owner when, with safety\nto both parties, it can be transferred. Should this be the case, then\nwill the Duke of Orleans deserve well of the elder branch of his family\nwho have behaved so kindly towards him, but I confess I am not one of\nthose who believe in the likelihood of such an abnegation of self, as\nthis voluntary abdication would display.\n\nRich possessions are seldom if ever willingly resigned, and a crown is\none said to have such irresistible charms to the person who has once\nworn it, that history furnishes but few examples like that of Charles\nthe Fifth, or Christina of Sweden. Time will prove whether\nLouis-Philippe d'Orléans will offer a _pendant_!\n\nI walked with Comte d'O---- this evening into the Champs-Elysees, and\ngreat was the change effected there within the last few days. It looks\nruined and desolate, the ground cut up by the pieces of cannon, and\ntroops as well as the mobs that have made it a thoroughfare, and many\nof the trees greatly injured, if not destroyed.\n\nA crowd was assembled around a man who was reading aloud for their\nedification a proclamation nailed to one of the trees. We paused for a\nmoment to hear it, when some of the persons recognising my companion,\nshouted aloud, \"_Vive le Comte d'Orsay! Vive le Comte d'Orsay!\"_ and\nthe cry being taken up by the mass, the reader was deserted, the fickle\nmultitude directing ail their attention and enthusiasm to tho new\ncomer. We had some difficulty in escaping from these troublesome and\nunexpected demonstrations of good will; and, while hurrying from the\nscene of this impromptu ovation to the unsought popularity of my\ncompanion, I made him smile by hinting at the danger in which he stood\nof being raised to the vacant throne by those who seem not to know or\ncare who is to fill it.\n\nComte d'O---- was as much puzzled as I was how to account for this\nburst of enthusiasm, for, taking no part in politics, and all his\nfamily being attached to the legitimate cause, this demonstration of\nregard appears more inexplicable. It seems, however, to establish one\nfact, and that is, that though the monarch has fallen into disrepute\nwith the people, the aristocracy have not, and this alone proves how\ntotally different are the feelings of those who have effected the\npresent revolution with those of the persons who were engaged in the\nformer one, a difference, perhaps, not more to be attributed to the\nchange produced in the people by the extension of education, than in\nthe _noblesse_ by the same cause, aided by the habits and feelings it\nengenders. Whatever may be the cause, the effect is salutary, for the\ngood understanding evident between the two classes tends greatly to the\namelioration and advantage of both. There is something very contagious\nin popular feeling. It resembles an epidemic from which few of the\nclass more peculiarly exposed to it escape.\n\nWalked into the streets to-day, for a carriage cannot yet pass through\nthem. Never did any town, not actually sacked, present a more changed\naspect. Houses damaged by shots, windows smashed, pavements destroyed,\nand trees cut down or mutilated, meet the eye along the Boulevards. The\ndestruction of the trees excited more regret in my mind than that of\nthe houses. There, many of them lay on the ground shorn of their leafy\nhonours, offering obstructions on the spots which they so lately\nornamented, while others stood bare and desolate, their giant limbs\nlopped off, their trunks shattered by bullets, and retaining only a few\nslight branches oh high, to which still adhered the parched,\ndiscoloured, and withered leaves, sole remnants of their lately\nluxuriant foliage.\n\nThe houses may be rebuilt and the streets newly paved, but how many\nyears will it take before these trees can be replaced! Those who loved\nto repose beneath their shade, or who, pent in a city, were solaced by\nbeholding them and thinking of the country of which they brought\npleasant recollections, will grieve to miss them, and, like me, own\nwith a sigh, while contemplating the ravages occasioned by the events\nof the last few days, that if good ever is effected by that most\ndangerous of all experiments, a revolution, it is too dearly bought.\n\nThe people seem as proud and pleased as possible with the\naccomplishment of the task they took in hand. How long will they\ncontinue so? They are like a too-spirited horse who, having mastered\nhis rider, requires a bolder and more expert hand to subjugate him\nagain to obedience, and the training will be all the more painful from\nthe previous insubordination. Of one thing the people may be proud, and\nthat is, their having not stained this revolution with any of the\ncrimes that have left so indelible a blot on the former one.\n\nHow soon does the mind habituate itself to an unnatural state of\nexcitement! My _femme de chambre_ positively looked blank and\ndisappointed this morning, when, on entering my _chambre à coucher_,\nshe answered in reply to my question, whether any thing new had\noccurred during the night, \"_Non, miladi, positivement rien_.\" Strange\nto say, I too felt _désoeuvré_ by the want of having something to be\nalarmed or to hope about,--I, who meddle not with politics, and wish\nall the world to be as quiet and as calm as myself. Every one I see\nappears to experience this same flatness, just like the reaction\nproduced on the spirits the first day or two after the Italian\nCarnival, when the cessation of gaiety, though felt to be a relief to\nthe frame, leaves the mind unfitted for repose.\n\nI find this feeling is generally experienced, for several of the\nshop-keepers, whose profit,--nay, whose very bread, depends on the\nrestoration of social order, confess it. One person, the wife of a\njeweller, owned to me to-day that Paris was now beginning to be very\n_triste_.\n\n\"To be sure they were no longer afraid to open their shops, and\ncommerce they hoped would soon become active again, but there was no\nmore the same interest continually awakened, as when every hour,--nay,\nevery minute brought some new event, and she and her neighbours looked\nout to behold the fighting in the streets, the wounded and the dying\ndropping around, and trembled for their own lives, and for the safety\nof those dear to them.\" In short, as she admitted, the want of\nexcitement was experienced by all those who had lately become\naccustomed to it, as much as it is felt by the habitual gamester who\ncannot live without play.\n\nThis is a dangerous state for the people of a great city to find\nthemselves in. Vastly more dangerous than if subdued by a\nlong-continued excess of excitement, their moral as well as their\nphysical force required repose, and they gladly resigned themselves to\nit.\n\nTo a sober-minded denizen of England, the ungovernable pride,\ninsatiable vanity, and love of fighting, inherent in the French, appear\nreally little short of insanity, to so great an excess do they push\nthese manias. This will always render them so difficult to be governed,\nthat it will require no ordinary abilities and firmness in him who\nundertakes the arduous task of ruling them. Yet the very excess of\nthese passions renders the French the most able, as they decidedly are\nthe most willing, instruments to be employed in achieving the aims of\nthe wildest ambition, or the most glorious enterprises. He will the\nlongest and most securely govern them, who calls these passions into\naction, provided always that they meet no check, for the French not\nonly bear adversity impatiently, but soon turn against him who has\nexposed them to it: witness their conduct to the Emperor Napoleon, who,\nwhile success frowned his banner, was their idol.\n\nPlaying at soldiers is the favourite game of Frenchmen of every class\nand description, and every opportunity afforded them of indulging it is\ngladly seized. When I compare the reluctance with which the yeomanry of\nIreland, or the local militia of England, leave their homes and their\nbusiness to \"assume the spear and shield,\" with the enthusiasm evinced\nby the _Garde Nationale_ when they are called to leave their\n_boutiques_ and don their uniforms, I am more than ever struck with the\nremarkable difference existing between two nations separated by so\nshort a distance. The English local militia man will fight when\noccasion requires, and with determined courage, too, because he\nbelieves it to be his duty, but the French National Guard will combat\nfor the mere love of combating, and forget home and interest in the\npleasure of the excitement.\n\nThe Duchesse de Guiche has returned to Paris, while her amiable and\nnoble-minded husband has accompanied the royal family to Cherbourg,\nwhere they are to embark for England. Nothing can exceed the courage\nand dignity with which she supports her altered fortunes. She thinks\nonly of those to whom the Duc and herself have been so long and so\ntruly devoted; and in her chagrin for their sufferings forgets her own.\n\nThe Duc has such a perfect confidence in her good sense and tact, that\nhe has sent her his _procuration_ to act for him in his absence. No\nsooner had she arrived at her abode, than she sent to demand the\nprotection of General Gérard[10] for the house and stables of the\nDauphin, and ho immediately ordered a guard to be placed there. Heaven\ngrant that she may not be exposed to any annoyance during the absence\nof her husband!\n\nThe Duchesse de Guiche gave a new proof of her courage and presence of\nmind yesterday. Early in the morning, having heard a noise in the\ncourtyard of her dwelling, she beheld from the window of her chamber an\nofficer gesticulating with violence, and menacing the grooms of the\nDauphin. The upper servant entered at the moment, and announced that\nthe officer insisted on seizing six of the finest horses in the stable,\nby order of General Lafayette.\n\nThe Duchesse descended to the courtyard, informed the officer that the\nwhole establishment was under the protection of General Gérard, without\nwhose orders no horse should leave the stables. He attempted to enforce\nhis pretensions; but the Duchesse desired the head groom to call out\nhis assistants, about thirty in number, who, armed with pitchforks and\nother implements of their calling, soon came forth; and the Duchesse\nassured the intruder that, unless he immediately retired, he should be\nforcibly expelled.\n\nSeeing the courage and determination of this high-spirited and\nbeautiful woman, the officer withdrew, and the horses were saved. It\nhas since been ascertained, as the Duchesse anticipated, that General\nLafayette had never given any orders to the officer who had used his\nname.\n\n_7th_.--The Duke of Orleans has at length accepted the crown; and\nvarious are the conjectures and reports to which his doing so has given\nrise. Many of them, as may be easily imagined, are not creditable to\nhim; but on this occasion, as on most others, the least charitable\nmotives are generally assigned to those whose conduct is judged by the\nmass often wholly ignorant of the reasons on which it is based. The\nvast wealth of the Duke of Orleans has a powerful influence; and those\nwho a few days ago exclaimed against royalty, and vaunted the superior\nadvantages of a government without a king, are now reconciled to having\none whose immense private fortune will exempt the nation from the\nnecessity of furnishing funds for a civil list. Should the new\nsovereign hereafter demand one, his popularity will be endangered; and\nthe King of the French, as he is styled, will be likely to find as\nlittle favour in the eyes of his subjects as the King of France\nexperienced.\n\nPopularity, always, and in all countries, an unstable possession, is in\nFrance infinitely more so; and Louis-Philippe must have more luck, as\nwell as more wisdom, than falls to the lot of mankind, to retain this\nfleeting good when the novelty of his reign has worn away. That he is a\nman of great ability no one seems to entertain a doubt; but his wisdom\nwould, in my opinion at least, have been more surely manifested had he\ndeclined instead of accepting the crown.\n\nThose who profess to be best acquainted with his sentiments declare,\nthat he only acceded to the wishes of the people in ascending the\nvacant throne, in order to preserve the charter, and to preclude the\ndangerous theoretical experiments into which the republican party was\nso desirous to plunge. It remains to be proved whether, in a few years\nhence, those who have subverted one monarchy by violence may not be\ntempted to have recourse to a similar measure in order to free\nthemselves from the successor they have chosen; for even already it\nappears clear to me, that the expectations entertained, not only by the\npartisans of Louis-Philippe, but by the generality of the people, are\nsuch as he never can fulfil. He may be their idol for a brief space,\nbut, like all other idols, he will be expected to perform miracles; and\nnot having the sanctity with which time invests even false gods, he may\nbe thrown from the pedestal to which he has been elevated as\nunceremoniously as he was raised to it.\n\nI saw General Lafayette to-day, and never felt more disappointed, as\nhis appearance does not at all correspond with what I had imagined it\nto be. The \"Lafayette _aux cheveux blancs_,\" as the popular song\ndescribes him to be, is, _au contraire_, a plain old man, with a dark\nbrown scratch wig, that conceals his forehead, and, consequently, gives\na very common and, to my thinking, a disagreeable expression to his\ncountenance. The _cheveux blancs_ would be a great improvement; for,\nindependently of the song thus describing him, one looks for the\nvenerable mark of age in this Nestor of revolutions, who in his youth\nhas seen his idol, Liberty, commit fearful crimes in France as well as\ngreat deeds in America, and who now, when on the threshold of the\ngrave, in which ere long he must repose, beholds her regeneration in\nhis native land, redeemed from the cruelty that formerly stained her\ncourse.\n\n\"_Voilà le grand Lafayette_!\" exclaimed one of the people as he passed\nto-day; \"_Oui, la ganache des deux mondes_,\" replied the other. Such is\npopular favour!\n\nI walked in the Palais-Royal to-day; and felt much more disposed to\npity than envy the King of the French, as Louis-Philippe is styled,\nwhen I beheld a crowd of idle miscreants, assembled in front of his\ndwelling, rudely and boisterously vociferating his name, and in a tone\nmuch more resembling command than entreaty, desiring his presence. He\nat length came forward, bowed repeatedly, pressed his hand to his\nheart, and then withdrew, looking, as I thought, rather ashamed of the\n_rôle_ he was called on to enact, while his riotous audience seemed\nelated at exhibiting his docility.\n\nThe Queen was then called for, and, after some delay, was handed\nforward by Louis-Philippe. It made me sad to look on the altered\ncountenance of this amiable woman, whom all parties allow to be a most\nfaultless wife and mother. She is hardly to be recognised as the same\nbeing who only a very few months ago looked the personification of\nhappiness. Already have deep care and anxiety left their furrows on her\nbrow, proving that\n\n     A diadem, howe'er so bright it be,\n     Brings cares that frighten gentle sleep away,\n     E'en when from buried ancestors it comes,\n     Who bless'd when they bequeath it to their heir;\n     For great is the responsibility\n     Of those who wear the symbol of a king,\n     In regular succession handed down\n     From sire to son through long antiquity.\n     But when th' anointed head that wore it once\n     Sleeps not in death--but exiled, worse than death--\n     And scions legitimate live to claim\n     Their birthright, oh! how heavy is that crown\n     (Though loose it fits), which well the wearer knows,\n     A people's breath may blow from of his brow,\n     Sear'd by the burning weight, it yet would guard,\n     E'n though it crush him.\n\nI am told that no day passes in which a crowd does not assemble beneath\nthe windows of Louis-Philippe and loudly vociferate for his presence.\nM. Laffitte is not unfrequently seen with the king on these occasions,\nand when they embrace the crowd applauds.\n\nI cannot imagine a more painful position than that of the Queen of the\nFrench. Devotedly attached to her husband and family, she will have\noften to tremble for their safety, exposed, as it must be, to the\ninconstancy and evil passions _soi-disant_ subjects, who may, ere long,\nbe disposed to pull down the throne they have erected for\nLouis-Philippe as rapidly as they raised the barricades for its\nelevation.\n\nHad the King of the French succeeded to the throne by the natural\ndemise of those who stood between him and it, how different would be\nhis position; for it is agreed by all who know him, that he has many\nqualities that eminently fit him to fill it with credit to himself and\nadvantage to the people; but as it is, I foresee nothing but trouble\nand anxiety for him,--a melancholy change from the domestic happiness\nhe formerly enjoyed. Any attempt to check the turbulence of the people\nwill be resented as an act of the utmost ingratitude to those who\nplaced the crown on his head; and if he suffers it with impunity, he\nwill not only lose his empire over them, but incur the contempt of the\nmore elevated of his subjects.\n\nI saw the King of the French walking through the Place Vendôme to-day,\nattended only by one person. He was recognised, and cheered, and\nreturned the salutation very graciously. And there stood the column\nerected to commemorate the victories of one now sleeping in a foreign\ngrave; one whose very name was once the talisman that excited all\nParisian hearts into the wildest enthusiasm!\n\nLouis-Philippe passed near the base of the column, which seemed to\nreturn a sullen echo to the voices that cheered him; did he, or those\naround him, remember their vicinity to this striking memorial of the\ninconstancy of the nation? The scene awakened more reflections in my\nmind than I dare say it did in that of those whose voices rent the air;\nbut though it might be only fancy, I thought the King of the French\nlooked very grave.\n\nMonsieur Mignet spent last evening here; his conversation is full of\ninterest, being the overflowing of a rich mind, free from prejudices,\nand his ideas, though methodically arranged and subjected to the ordeal\nof a sober judgment, bear the warm tint of a brilliant imagination,\nthat might have rendered him a poet, had he not chosen to be a\nhistorian. The Revolution has produced no visible change in this clever\nand agreeable man, who, filling the office of Keeper of the Archives,\ndevotes his time to studies and researches in harmony with the pursuits\nto which he has many years been accustomed, and hears the success of\nthe popular cause, to which he has long been attached, with a\nmoderation and equanimity highly indicative of a philosophical mind,\nallied to an amiable disposition. There is something so striking in the\nappearance of Monsieur Mignet, that all strangers, who meet him here,\nremark the fine character of his head and the expression of his\ncountenance.\n\nThe celebrated General Peppé dined here yesterday, and is very unlike\nthe revolutionary hero I had pictured him to be. Mild, well-bred, and\namiable in his manner, he seems much more suited to command a regiment\nin support of a legitimate monarchy, than to subvert one. Although\nliberty appears to be with him a monomania, the warmth with which he\nadvocates it in conversation never urges him beyond the bounds of good\nbreeding.\n\nIt is a strange infatuation to suppose that as civilisation extends its\ninfluence, men will have faith in the Utopian schemes of well-meaning\nvisionaries, and risk evils they know not, in exchange for a state\nwhich, if not quite faultless, has at least much of good. How many\nbrave and honourable men become the dupes of heated imaginations and\nerroneous opinions, which, urging them to effect an amelioration of\nsome grievances, incur the penalty of imparting greater ones! General\nPeppé is liked by all who know him, though all lament the monomania\nthat has gained such an ascendency over his mind. His brother, General\nFlorestan Peppé at Naples, whom we esteem so much, is one of the most\nexcellent men I ever knew.\n\nThe Duc de Guiche has returned to Paris, after having seen the royal\nfamily safely embarked at Cherbourg. The departure of the aged monarch\npresented a melancholy scene. At his time of life, he can never hope to\nbehold his country again, and the sudden change from the throne of a\ngreat kingdom to a compelled exile in a foreign land is a reverse of\nfortune that demands a philosophy to support, with which few are blest.\n\nThere is something touching in the attachment of the Duc and Duchesse\nde Guiche to this unfortunate family, and above all, to the Dauphin and\nDauphine. Always aware of their affection for them, I never imagined\nthe strength of it, until the adversity which has sent so many of those\nwho had previously loudly professed their devotion to them away, but\nwhich has increased the feelings of reverence towards them in this\nestimable couple, by mingling with it a sentiment of deep\ncommiseration, that induces a still greater display of respect, now\nthat so many others dispense with evincing it. The Duc is charged with\nthe disposal of the property of the Dauphin; and, when this task is\naccomplished, he and his family will follow the fallen fortunes of\nCharles the Tenth, and join him at Holyrood.\n\nLoving France as they do, and wishing their sons to be brought up in\nthe land of their birth, strong indeed must be the affection that\ninduces them to abandon it, in order to devote themselves to the exiled\nBourbons. This devotion to the fallen is the more meritorious when the\nliberality of the Duc's political opinions is taken into consideration.\nHow few sovereigns find such devotion in adversity! and how seldom are\nmen to be met with capable of sacrificing their own interests and the\nfuture prospects of their children to a sense of duty!\n\nA lapse in my journal.--All seems now settled. The foreign powers have\nacknowledged the King of the French; and this acknowledgment has not\nonly delighted his subjects, but confirmed them in the belief of their\nown right to make or unmake sovereigns according to their will and\npleasure.\n\nThe English are very popular in Paris at this moment, and the ready\nrecognition of Louis-Philippe by our government has increased this good\nfeeling. A vast crowd escorted the carriage of Mr. Hamilton, the\nSecretary of the Embassy, to his door, as he returned from his first\naccredited audience of the new monarch, and cries of _Vivent les\nAnglais!_ filled the air. As Mr. Hamilton resides in the house next to\nthe one I occupy, I had an opportunity of beholding this ovation\noffered to him, and the people certainly evinced very groat enthusiasm\non the occasion.\n\nM. Thiers, M. Mignet, Count Valeski, and Mr. Francis Raring, dined here\nyesterday. M. Thiers was very brilliant and amusing. It is impossible\nto meet him even once without being struck with the remarkable talent\nthat characterises every sentence he utters; and yet each observation\ncomes forth with such spirit and vivacity, that it is easy to see it\nhas been elicited at the moment by some remark from another, and not\nfrom meditation.\n\nThere is a hardiness in his conceptions, and an epigrammatic terseness\nin the expression of them, that command attention; and the readiness\nwith which he seizes, analyses, and disposes of a question, betrays\nsuch a versatility of mental power as to convey a conviction that he is\na man who cannot fail to fill a distinguished place in France, where,\nat present, abilities furnish the master-key that opens the door to\nhonours and fortune. M. Thiers appears to entertain a consciousness of\nhis talents, but does not, I really think, overrate them.\n\nThe Prince and Princess Soutzo with their family, spent yesterday with\nus. Their eldest daughter, the Princess Helena, is a beautiful girl,\nwith captivating manners, and highly cultivated mind, and the little\nMary, though still in infancy, is one of the cleverest children I ever\nsaw. Never did I see young people better brought up than are the sons\nand daughters of this excellent couple, or a more united family.\n\nMr. and Miss Poulter, and William Spencer the poet, I dined here\nyesterday. Mr. Poulter is a sensible man, and his sister is well\ninformed and intelligent.\n\nIt is now decided that we go to England! Two years ago I should have\nreturned there with gladness, but now!--I dread it. How changed will\nall appear without _him_ whose ever-watchful affection anticipated\nevery wish, and realised every hope! I ought to feel pleased at leaving\nParis, where the heaviest trial of my life has occurred, but _here_ I\nhave now learned to get inured to the privation of his society, while\nin England I shall have again to acquire the hard lesson of\nresignation.\n\n_November_, 1830.--This is the last entry I shall make in my journal in\nParis, for to-morrow we depart for England.\n\nI have passed the day in taking leave of those dear to me, and my\nspirits have failed under the effort. Some of them I shall probably\nnever again behold. The dear and excellent Madame Craufurd is among\nthose about whom I entertain the most melancholy presentiments, because\nat her advanced age I can hardly hope to find her, should I again\nreturn to France. She referred to this to-day with streaming eyes, and\nbrought many a tear to mine by the sadness of her anticipations.\n\nThe Duc and Duchess de Guiche I shall soon see in England, on their\nroute to Edinburgh, to join tho exiled family at Holyrood, for they are\ndetermined not to forsake them in adversity.\n\nAdieu a Paris! two years and a half ago I entered you with gladness,\nand the future looked bright; I leave you with altered feelings, for\nthe present is cheerless and the future clouded.\n\nNOTES\n\n\n[1: Now Baron d'Haussey.]\n\n[2: The hermitage was lent him by Madame d'Epinay, to whom his\nsubsequent ingratitude forms a dark page in her _Mémoires_.]\n\n[3: The present Lord Abinger.]\n\n[4: Now Lord Glenelg.]\n\n[5: Now Lord Francis Egerton.]\n\n\n[6: Now Madame Émile de Girardin.]\n\n[7: \"Where thou beholdest Genius,\n    There thou beholdest, too, the martyr's crown.\"]\n\n[8: The present Earl of Cadogan.]\n\n[9: The Duc de Guiche, being _premier menin_ to the Dauphin, used,\naccording to custom, the arms and liveries of that prince.]\n\n[10: Now Maréchal.]\n\n\n\nINDEX TO THE CONTENTS.\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\n\nNISMES.\n\nAntiquities of this City--The Hôtel du Midi--Articles of\nMerchandise--History of the Maison Carrée--Work of Poldo d'Albenas--The\nBuilding described--Origin of it--Now used as a Museum--Monument to\nMarcus Attius--Cardinal Alberoni--Barbarous Project--Removal of\nAntiquities--The Amphitheatre described--Charles Martel--Excellent\nPrecaution in Roman Theatres--Inscription--Officious Cicerone--Gate of\nAugustus--La Tour-Magne--Excavations--Fine Fountain--Temple of\nDiana--Brevity of Human Life, 1.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nTOWN OF ARLES.\n\nBeaucaire--Wooden Houses--Castle of King René--Church of St.\nMartha--Fabulous Monster--The Hôtel described--The Hostess--Antique\nFurniture--Plentiful Dinner--Scrutiny--Visit to the Amphitheatre--The\nPrefect of Arles--Subterranean Excavations--Ancient Church of St.\nAnne--Altar to the Goddess of Good--Venus of Arles--Granite\nObelisk--Primitive Manners--A Liberal Landlady, 14.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nST.-RÉMY.\n\nSituation of the Town--Antiquities--The Triumphal Arch described--Male\nand Female Figures--The Mausoleum--Bassi-relievi of Battles, Infantry,\netc.--Figure of a Winged Female--Latin Inscription--Variously\nexplained--Interpretation of Monsieur P.

Here,\nhowever, the supernatural appearances are never explained away, and\nthe ghostly agencies are introduced in the spirit of serious, if\nsomewhat melodramatic, romance. Marryat's personal experience enabled\nhim, with little research, to produce a life-like picture of old Dutch\nseamanship, and his powers in racy narrative have transformed the\nVanderdecken legend into a stirring tale of terror. The plot cannot\nbe called original, but it is more carefully worked out and, from the\nnature of the material at hand, more effective than most of Marryat's\nown. He has put life into it, moreover, by the creation of some\ngenuine characters, designed for nobler ends than to move the\nmachinery.\n\nAmine, indeed, as Mr Hannay points out, \"is by far his nearest\napproach to an acceptable heroine.\" Her romantic and curiously\nsuperstitious disposition is admirably restrained by strength of will\nand true courage. The scenes of the Inquisition by which she meets\nher death are forcibly described. Philip Vanderdecken is a very\nrespectable hero; daring, impetuous, and moody, without being too\nimprobably capable. The hand of destiny lends him a dignity of which\nhe is by no means unworthy. Krantz, the faithful friend, belongs to a\nfamiliar type, but the one-eyed pilot is quite sufficiently weird\nfor the part he has to play. For the rest we have the usual exciting\nadventures by sea and land; the usual \"humours,\" in this case\ncertainly not overdone. The miser Dr Poots; the bulky Kloots, his\nbear, and his supercargo; Barentz and his crazy lady-love the _Vrow\nKaterina_; and the little Portuguese Commandant provide the reader\nwith a variety of good-natured entertainment. It was an act of\ndoubtful wisdom, perhaps, to introduce a second group of spirits from\nthe Hartz mountains, but the story of the weir-wolves is told simply,\nwithout any straining after effect.\n\nThe general success, however, is marred by certain obvious failures\nin detail. The attempt to produce an historic flavour by making the\ncharacters, during their calmer moments, talk in would-be old English\nis more amusing than culpable; but the author's philosophy of the\nunseen, as expounded by Amine or Krantz, is both weak and tiresome,\nand his religious discourses, coloured by prejudice against the\nRomanists, are conventional and unconvincing. The closing scene\nsavours of the Sunday-school.\n\nBut these faults are not obtrusive, and the novel as a whole must take\na high place among its author's second-best.\n\n_The Phantom Ship_ appeared in _The New Monthly Magazine_, 1838, 1839.\nIt is here reprinted from the first edition, in three volumes. Henry\nColburn, 1839.\n\nR.B.J.\n\n\n\n\nChapter I\n\n\nAbout the middle of the seventeenth century, in the outskirts of the\nsmall but fortified town of Terneuse, situated on the right bank of\nthe Scheldt, and nearly opposite to the island of Walcheren, there was\nto be seen, in advance of a few other even more humble tenements, a\nsmall but neat cottage, built according to the prevailing taste of the\ntime. The outside front had, some years back, been painted of a deep\norange, the windows and shutters of a vivid green. To about three feet\nabove the surface of the earth, it was faced alternately with blue and\nwhite tiles. A small garden, of about two rods of our measure of land,\nsurrounded the edifice; and this little plot was flanked by a low\nhedge of privet, and encircled by a moat full of water, too wide to be\nleaped with ease. Over that part of the moat which was in front of\nthe cottage door, was a small and narrow bridge, with ornamented\niron hand-rails, for the security of the passenger. But the colours,\noriginally so bright, with which the cottage had been decorated, had\nnow faded; symptoms of rapid decay were evident in the window-sills,\nthe door-jambs, and other wooden parts of the tenement, and many of\nthe white and blue tiles had fallen down, and had not been replaced.\nThat much care had once been bestowed upon this little tenement, was\nas evident as that latterly it had been equally neglected.\n\nThe inside of the cottage, both on the basement and the floor above,\nwas divided into two larger rooms in front, and two smaller behind;\nthe rooms in front could only be called large in comparison with the\nother two, as they were little more than twelve feet square, with but\none window to each. The upper floor was, as usual, appropriated to the\nbedrooms; on the lower, the two smaller rooms were now used only as a\nwash-house and a lumber-room; while one of the larger was fitted up as\na kitchen, and furnished with dressers, on which the metal utensils\nfor cookery shone clean and polished as silver. The room itself was\nscrupulously neat; but the furniture, as well as the utensils, were\nscanty. The boards of the floor were of a pure white, and so clean\nthat you might have laid anything down without fear of soiling it. A\nstrong deal table, two wooden-seated chairs, and a small easy couch,\nwhich had been removed from one of the bedrooms upstairs, were all\nthe movables which this room contained. The other front room had been\nfitted up as a parlour; but what might be the style of its furniture\nwas now unknown, for no eye had beheld the contents of that room for\nnearly seventeen years, during which it had been hermetically sealed,\neven to the inmates of the cottage.\n\nThe kitchen, which we have described, was occupied by two persons. One\nwas a woman, apparently about forty years of age, but worn down by\npain and suffering. She had evidently once possessed much beauty:\nthere were still the regular outlines, the noble forehead, and the\nlarge dark eye; but there was a tenuity in her features, a wasted\nappearance, such as to render the flesh transparent; her brow, when\nshe mused, would sink into deep wrinkles, premature though they were;\nand the occasional flashing of her eyes strongly impressed you\nwith the idea of insanity. There appeared to be some deep-seated,\nirremovable, hopeless cause of anguish, never for one moment permitted\nto be absent from her memory: a chronic oppression, fixed and graven\nthere, only to be removed by death. She was dressed in the widow's\ncoif of the time; but although clean and neat, her garments were faded\nfrom long wear. She was seated upon the small couch which we have\nmentioned, evidently brought down as a relief to her, in her declining\nstate.\n\nOn the deal table in the centre of the room sat the other person, a\nstout, fair-headed, florid youth of nineteen or twenty years old. His\nfeatures were handsome and bold, and his frame powerful to excess; his\neye denoted courage and determination, and as he carelessly swung his\nlegs, and whistled an air in an emphatic manner, it was impossible\nnot to form the idea that he was a daring, adventurous, and reckless\ncharacter.\n\n\"Do not go to sea, Philip; oh, promise me _that_, my dear, dear\nchild,\" said the female, clasping her hands.\n\n\"And why not go to sea, mother?\" replied Philip; \"what's the use of my\nstaying here to starve?--for, by Heaven! it's little better. I must do\nsomething for myself and for you. And what else can I do? My uncle Van\nBrennen has offered to take me with him, and will give me good wages.\nThen I shall live happily on board, and my earnings will be sufficient\nfor your support at home.\"\n\n\"Philip--Philip, hear me. I shall die if you leave me. Whom have I in\nthe world but you? O my child, as you love me, and I know you _do_\nlove me, Philip, don't leave me; but if you will, at all events do not\ngo to sea.\"\n\nPhilip gave no immediate reply; he whistled for a few seconds, while\nhis mother wept.\n\n\"Is it,\" said he at last, \"because my father was drowned at sea, that\nyou beg so hard, mother?\"\n\n\"Oh, no--no!\" exclaimed the sobbing woman. \"Would to God--\"\n\n\"Would to God what, mother?\"\n\n\"Nothing--nothing. Be merciful--be merciful, O God!\" replied the\nmother, sliding from her seat on the couch, and kneeling by the side\nof it, in which attitude she remained for some time in fervent prayer.\n\nAt last she resumed her seat, and her face wore an aspect of more\ncomposure.\n\nPhilip, who, during this, had remained silent and thoughtful, again\naddressed his mother.\n\n\"Look ye, mother. You ask me to stay on shore with you, and\nstarve,--rather hard conditions:--now hear what I have to say. That\nroom opposite has been shut up ever since I can remember--why, you\nwill never tell me; but once I heard you say, when we were without\nbread, and with no prospect of my uncle's return--you were then half\nfrantic, mother, as you know you sometimes are--\"\n\n\"Well, Philip, what did you hear me say?\" enquired his mother with\ntremulous anxiety.\n\n\"You said, mother, that there was money in that room which would save\nus; and then you screamed and raved, and said that you preferred\ndeath. Now, mother, what is there in that chamber, and why has it been\nso long shut up? Either I know that, or I go to sea.\"\n\nAt the commencement of this address of Philip, his mother appeared\nto be transfixed, and motionless as a statue; gradually her lips\nseparated, and her eyes glared; she seemed to have lost the power of\nreply; she put her hand to her right side, as if to compress it, then\nboth her hands, as if to relieve herself from excruciating torture: at\nlast she sank, with her head forward, and the blood poured out of her\nmouth.\n\nPhilip sprang from the table to her assistance, and prevented her from\nfalling on the floor. He laid her on the couch, watching with alarm\nthe continued effusion.\n\n\"Oh! mother--mother, what is this?\" cried he, at last, in great\ndistress.\n\nFor some time his mother could make him no reply; she turned further\non her side, that she might not be suffocated by the discharge from\nthe ruptured vessel, and the snow-white planks of the floor were soon\ncrimsoned with her blood.\n\n\"Speak, dearest mother, if you can,\" repeated Philip, in agony; \"what\nshall I do? what shall I give you? God Almighty! what is this?\"\n\n\"Death, my child, death!\" at length replied the poor woman, sinking\ninto a state of unconsciousness.\n\nPhilip, now much alarmed, flew out of the cottage, and called the\nneighbours to his mother's assistance. Two or three hastened to the\ncall; and as soon as Philip saw them occupied in restoring his mother,\nhe ran as fast as he could to the house of a medical man, who lived\nabout a mile off--one Mynheer Poots, a little, miserable, avaricious\nwretch, but known to be very skilful in his profession. Philip found\nPoots at home, and insisted upon his immediate attendance.\n\n\"I will come--yes, most certainly,\" replied Poots, who spoke the\nlanguage but imperfectly; \"but Mynheer Vanderdecken, who will pay me?\"\n\n\"Pay you! my uncle will, directly that he comes home.\"\n\n\"Your uncle de Skipper Van Brennen: no, he owes me four guilders, and\nhe has owed me for a long time. Besides, his ship may sink.\"\n\n\"He shall pay you the four guilders, and for this attendance also,\"\nreplied Philip, in a rage; \"come directly, while you are disputing my\nmother may be dead.\"\n\n\"But, Mr Philip, I cannot come, now I recollect; I have to see the\nchild of the burgomaster at Terneuse,\" replied Mynheer Poots.\n\n\"Look you, Mynheer Poots,\" exclaimed Philip, red with passion; \"you\nhave but to choose,--will you go quietly, or must I take you there?\nYou'll not trifle with me.\"\n\nHere Mynheer Poots was under considerable alarm, for the character of\nPhilip Vanderdecken was well known.\n\n\"I will come by-and-bye, Mynheer Philip, if I can.\"\n\n\"You'll come now, you wretched old miser,\" exclaimed Philip, seizing\nhold of the little man by the collar, and pulling him out of his door.\n\n\"Murder! murder!\" cried Poots, as he lost his legs, and was dragged\nalong by the impetuous young man.\n\nPhilip stopped, for he perceived that Poots was black in the face.\n\n\"Must I then choke you, to make you go quietly? for, hear me, go you\nshall, alive or dead.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" replied Poots, recovering himself, \"I will go, but I'll\nhave you in prison to-night: and, as for your mother, I'll not--no,\nthat I will not--Mynheer Philip, depend upon it.\"\n\n\"Mark me, Mynheer Poots,\" replied Philip, \"as sure as there is a God\nin heaven, if you do not come with me, I'll choke you now; and when\nyou arrive, if you do not do your best for my poor mother, I'll murder\nyou there. You know that I always do what I say, so now take my\nadvice, come along quietly, and you shall certainly be paid, and well\npaid--if I sell my coat.\"\n\nThis last observation of Philip, perhaps, had more effect than even\nhis threats. Poots was a miserable little atom, and like a child\nin the powerful grasp of the young man. The doctor's tenement was\nisolated, and he could obtain no assistance until within a hundred\nyards of Vanderdecken's cottage; so Mynheer Poots decided that he\nwould go, first, because Philip had promised to pay him, and secondly,\nbecause he could not help it.\n\nThis point being settled, Philip and Mynheer Poots made all haste to\nthe cottage; and on their arrival, they found his mother still in the\narms of two of her female neighbours, who were bathing her temples\nwith vinegar. She was in a state of consciousness, but she could not\nspeak. Poots ordered her to be carried upstairs and put to bed, and\npouring some acids down her throat, hastened away with Philip to\nprocure the necessary remedies.\n\n\"You will give your mother that directly, Mynheer Philip,\" said Poots,\nputting a phial into his hand; \"I will now go to the child of the\nburgomaster, and will afterwards come back to your cottage.\"\n\n\"Don't deceive me,\" said Philip, with a threatening look.\n\n\"No, no, Mynheer Philip, I would not trust to your uncle Van Brennen\nfor payment, but you have promised, and I know that you always keep\nyour word. In one hour I will be with your mother; but you yourself\nmust now be quick.\"\n\nPhilip hastened home. After the potion had been administered, the\nbleeding was wholly stopped; and in half an hour, his mother could\nexpress her wishes in a whisper. When the little doctor arrived, he\ncarefully examined his patient, and then went downstairs with her son\ninto the kitchen.\n\n\"Mynheer Philip,\" said Poots, \"by Allah! I have done my best, but I\nmust tell you that I have little hopes of your mother rising from her\nbed again. She may live one day or two days, but not more. It is not\nmy fault, Mynheer Philip,\" continued Poots, in a deprecating tone.\n\n\"No, no; it is the will of Heaven,\" replied Philip, mournfully.\n\n\"And you will pay me, Mynheer Vanderdecken?\" continued the doctor,\nafter a short pause.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Philip in a voice of thunder, and starting from a\nreverie. After a moment's silence, the doctor recommenced.\n\n\"Shall I come to-morrow, Mynheer Philip? You know that will be a\ncharge of another guilder: it is of no use to throw away money or time\neither.\"\n\n\"Come to-morrow, come every hour, charge what you please; you shall\ncertainly be paid,\" replied Philip, curling his lip with contempt.\n\n\"Well, it is as you please. As soon as she is dead, the cottage and\nthe furniture will be yours, and you will sell them of course. Yes, I\nwill come. You will have plenty of money. Mynheer Philip, I would like\nthe first offer of the cottage, if it is to let.\"\n\nPhilip raised his arm in the air as if to crush Mynheer Poots, who\nretreated to the corner.\n\n\"I did not mean until your mother was buried,\" said Poots, in a\ncoaxing tone.\n\n\"Go, wretch, go!\" said Philip, covering his face with his hands, as he\nsank down upon the blood-stained couch.\n\nAfter a short interval, Philip Vanderdecken returned to the bedside\nof his mother, whom he found much better; and the neighbours, having\ntheir own affairs to attend to, left them alone. Exhausted with the\nloss of blood, the poor woman slumbered for many hours, during which\nshe never let go the hand of Philip, who watched her breathing in\nmournful meditation.\n\nIt was about one o'clock in the morning when the widow awoke. She had\nin a great degree recovered her voice, and thus she addressed her\nson:--\n\n\"My dear, my impetuous boy, and have I detained you here a prisoner so\nlong?\"\n\n\"My own inclination detained me, mother. I leave you not to others\nuntil you are up and well again.\"\n\n\"That, Philip, I shall never be. I feel that death claims me; and, O,\nmy son, were it not for you, how should I quit this world rejoicing!\nI have long been dying, Philip,--and long, long have I prayed for\ndeath.\"\n\n\"And why so, mother?\" replied Philip, bluntly; \"I've done my best.\"\n\n\"You have, my child, you have: and may God bless you for it. Often\nhave I seen you curb your fiery temper--restrain yourself when\njustified in wrath--to spare a mother's feelings. 'Tis now some days\nthat even hunger has not persuaded you to disobey your mother. And,\nPhilip, you must have thought me mad or foolish to insist so long, and\nyet to give no reason. I'll speak--again--directly.\"\n\nThe widow turned her head upon the pillow, and remained quiet for some\nminutes; then, as if revived, she resumed:\n\n\"I believe I have been mad at times--have I not, Philip? And God knows\nI have had a secret in my heart enough to drive a wife to frenzy. It\nhas oppressed me day and night, worn my mind, impaired my reason, and\nnow, at last, thank Heaven! it has overcome this mortal frame: the\nblow is struck, Philip,--I'm sure it is. I wait but to tell you\nall,--and yet I would not,--'twill turn your brain as it has turned\nmine, Philip.\"\n\n\"Mother,\" replied Philip, earnestly, \"I conjure you, let me hear this\nkilling secret. Be heaven or hell mixed up with it, I fear not. Heaven\nwill not hurt me, and Satan I defy.\"\n\n\"I know thy bold, proud spirit, Philip,--thy strength of mind. If\nanyone could bear the load of such a dreadful tale, thou couldst. My\nbrain, alas! was far too weak for it; and I see it is my duty to tell\nit to thee.\"\n\nThe widow paused as her thoughts reverted to that which she had to\nconfide; for a few minutes the tears rained down her hollow cheeks;\nshe then appeared to have summoned resolution, and to have regained\nstrength.\n\n\"Philip, it is of your father I would speak. It is supposed--that he\nwas--drowned at sea.\"\n\n\"And was he not, mother?\" replied Philip, with surprise.\n\n\"O no!\"\n\n\"But he has long been dead, mother?\"\n\n\"No,--yes,--and yet--no,\" said the widow, covering her eyes.\n\nHer brain wanders, thought Philip, but he spoke again:\n\n\"Then where is he, mother?\"\n\nThe widow raised herself, and a tremor visibly ran through her whole\nframe, as she replied--\n\n\"IN LIVING JUDGMENT.\"\n\nThe poor woman then sank down again upon the pillow, and covered her\nhead with the bedclothes, as if she would have hid herself from her\nown memory. Philip was so much perplexed and astounded, that he could\nmake no reply. A silence of some minutes ensued, when, no longer able\nto beat the agony of suspense, Philip faintly whispered--\n\n\"The secret, mother, the secret; quick, let me hear it.\"\n\n\"I can now tell all, Philip,\" replied his mother, in a solemn tone of\nvoice. \"Hear me, my son. Your father's disposition was but too like\nyour own;--O may his cruel fate be a lesson to you, my dear, dear\nchild! He was a bold, a daring, and, they say, a first-rate seaman.\nHe was not born here, but in Amsterdam; but he would not live there,\nbecause he still adhered to the Catholic religion. The Dutch, you\nknow, Philip, are heretics, according to our creed. It is now\nseventeen years or more that he sailed for India, in his fine ship\nthe _Amsterdammer_, with a valuable cargo. It was his third voyage to\nIndia, Philip, and it was to have been, if it had so pleased God,\nhis last, for he had purchased that good ship with only part of his\nearnings, and one more voyage would have made his fortune. O! how\noften did we talk over what we would do upon his return, and how these\nplans for the future consoled me at the idea of his absence, for I\nloved him dearly, Philip,--he was always good and kind to me; and\nafter he had sailed, how I hoped for his return! The lot of a sailor's\nwife is not to be envied. Alone and solitary for so many months,\nwatching the long wick of the candle, and listening to the howling of\nthe wind--foreboding evil and accident--wreck and widowhood. He had\nbeen gone about six months, Philip, and there was still a long dreary\nyear to wait before I could expect him back. One night, you, my\nchild, were fast asleep; you were my only solace--my comfort in my\nloneliness. I had been watching over you in your slumbers; you smiled\nand half pronounced the name of mother; and at last I kissed your\nunconscious lips, and I knelt and prayed--prayed for God's blessing on\nyou, my child, and upon him too--little thinking, at the time, that he\nwas so horribly, so fearfully CURSED.\"\n\nThe widow paused for breath, and then resumed. Philip could not speak.\nHis lips were sundered, and his eyes riveted upon his mother, as he\ndevoured her words.\n\n\"I left you and went downstairs into that room, Philip, which since\nthat dreadful night has never been re-opened. I sate me down and read,\nfor the wind was strong, and when the gale blows, a sailor's wife can\nseldom sleep. It was past midnight, and the rain poured down. I felt\nunusual fear,--I knew not why. I rose from the couch and dipped my\nfinger in the blessed water, and I crossed myself. A violent gust\nof wind roared round the house, and alarmed me still more. I had a\npainful, horrible foreboding; when, of a sudden, the windows and\nwindow-shutters were all blown in, the light was extinguished, and\nI was left in utter darkness. I screamed with fright; but at last I\nrecovered myself, and was proceeding towards the window that I\nmight reclose it, when whom should I behold, slowly entering at the\ncasement, but--your father,--Philip!--Yes, Philip,--it was your\nfather!\"\n\n\"Merciful God!\" muttered Philip, in a low tone almost subdued into a\nwhisper.\n\n\"I knew not what to think,--he was in the room; and although the\ndarkness was intense, his form and features were as clear and as\ndefined as if it were noon-day. Fear would have inclined me to recoil\nfrom,--his loved presence to fly towards him. I remained on the spot\nwhere I was, choked with agonising sensations. When he had entered the\nroom, the windows and shutters closed of themselves, and the candle\nwas relighted--then I thought it was his apparition, and I fainted on\nthe floor.\n\n\"When I recovered I found myself on the couch, and perceived that\na cold (O how cold!) and dripping hand was clasped in mine. This\nreassured me, and I forgot the supernatural signs which accompanied\nhis appearance. I imagined that he had been unfortunate, and had\nreturned home. I opened my eyes, and beheld my loved husband and threw\nmyself into his arms. His clothes were saturated with the rain: I\nfelt as if I had embraced ice--but nothing can check the warmth of a\nwoman's love, Philip. He received my caresses, but he caressed\nnot again: he spoke not, but looked thoughtful and unhappy.\n'William--William,' cried I! 'speak, Vanderdecken, speak to your dear\nCatherine.'\n\n\"'I will,' replied he, solemnly, 'for my time is short.'\n\n\"'No, no, you must not go to sea again: you have lost your vessel, but\nyou are safe. Have I not you again?'\n\n\"'Alas! no--be not alarmed, but listen, for my time is short. I have\nnot lost my vessel, Catherine, BUT I HAVE LOST!!! Make no reply, but\nlisten; I am not dead, nor yet am I alive. I hover between this world\nand the world of Spirits. Mark me.\n\n\"'For nine weeks did I try to force my passage against the elements\nround the stormy Cape, but without success; and I swore terribly.\nFor nine weeks more did I carry sail against the adverse winds and\ncurrents, and yet could gain no ground; and then I blasphemed,--ay,\nterribly blasphemed. Yet still I persevered. The crew, worn out\nwith long fatigue, would have had me return to the Table Bay; but I\nrefused; nay, more, I became a murderer,--unintentionally, it is true,\nbut still a murderer. The pilot opposed me, and persuaded the men to\nbind me, and in the excess of my fury, when he took me by the collar,\nI struck at him; he reeled; and, with the sudden lurch of the vessel,\nhe fell overboard, and sank. Even this fearful death did not restrain\nme; and I swore by the fragment of the Holy Cross, preserved in that\nrelic now hanging round your neck, that I would gain my point in\ndefiance of storm and seas, of lightning, of heaven, or of hell, even\nif I should beat about until the Day of Judgment.\n\n\"'My oath was registered in thunder, and in streams of sulphurous\nfire. The hurricane burst upon the ship, the canvas flew away in\nribbons; mountains of seas swept over us, and in the centre of a deep\no'erhanging cloud, which shrouded all in utter darkness, were written\nin letters of livid flame, these words--UNTIL THE DAY OF JUDGMENT.\n\n\"'Listen to me, Catherine, my time is short. _One Hope_ alone remains,\nand for this am I permitted to come here. Take this letter.' He put a\nsealed paper on the table. 'Read it, Catherine, dear, and try if you\ncan assist me. Read it and now farewell--my time is come.'\n\n\"Again the window and window-shutters burst open--again the light was\nextinguished, and the form of my husband was, as it were, wafted in\nthe dark expanse. I started up and followed him with outstretched arms\nand frantic screams as he sailed through the window;--my glaring eyes\nbeheld his form borne away like lightning on the wings of the wild\ngale, till it was lost as a speck of light, and then it disappeared.\nAgain the windows closed, the light burned, and I was left alone!\n\n\"Heaven, have mercy! My brain!--my brain!--Philip!--Philip!\" shrieked\nthe poor woman; \"don't leave me--don't--don't--pray don't!\"\n\nDuring these exclamations the frantic widow had raised herself from\nthe bed, and, at the last, had fallen into the arms of her son. She\nremained there some minutes without motion. After a time Philip felt\nalarmed at her long quiescence; he laid her gently down upon the bed,\nand as he did so her head fell back--her eyes were turned--the widow\nVanderdecken was no more.\n\n\n\n\nChapter II\n\n\nPhilip Vanderdecken, strong as he was in mental courage, was almost\nparalysed by the shock when he discovered that his mother's spirit had\nfled; and for some time he remained by the side of the bed with his\neyes fixed upon the corpse, and his mind in a state of vacuity.\nGradually he recovered himself; he rose, smoothed down the pillow,\nclosed her eyelids, and then clasping his hands, the tears trickled\ndown his manly cheeks. He impressed a solemn kiss upon the pale white\nforehead of the departed, and drew the curtains round the bed.\n\n\"Poor mother!\" said he, sorrowfully, as he completed his task, \"at\nlength thou hast found rest,--but thou hast left thy son a bitter\nlegacy.\"\n\nAnd as Philip's thoughts reverted to what had passed, the dreadful\nnarrative whirled in his imagination and scathed his brain. He raised\nhis hands to his temples, compressed them with force, and tried to\ncollect his thoughts, that he might decide upon what measures he\nshould take. He felt that he had no time to indulge his grief. His\nmother was in peace: but his father--where was he?\n\nHe recalled his mother's words--\"One hope alone remained.\" Then there\nwas hope. His father had laid a paper on the table--could it be there\nnow? Yes, it must be; his mother had not had the courage to take it\nup. There was hope in that paper, and it had lain unopened for more\nthan seventeen years.\n\nPhilip Vanderdecken resolved that he would examine the fatal\nchamber--at once he would know the worst. Should he do it now, or wait\ntill daylight?--but the key, where was it? His eyes rested upon an old\njapanned cabinet in the room: he had never seen his mother open it in\nhis presence: it was the only likely place of concealment that he was\naware of. Prompt in all his decisions, he took up the candle, and\nproceeded to examine it. It was not locked; the doors swung open, and\ndrawer after drawer was examined, but Philip discovered not the object\nof his search; again and again did he open the drawers, but they were\nall empty. It occurred to Philip that there might be secret drawers,\nand he examined for some time in vain. At last he took out all the\ndrawers, and laid them on the floor, and lifting the cabinet off its\nstand he shook it. A rattling sound in one corner told him that in all\nprobability the key was there concealed. He renewed his attempts to\ndiscover how to gain it, but in vain. Daylight now streamed through\nthe casements, and Philip had not desisted from his attempts: at last,\nwearied out, he resolved to force the back panel of the cabinet; he\ndescended to the kitchen, and returned with a small chopping-knife and\nhammer, and was on his knees busily employed forcing out the panel,\nwhen a hand was placed upon his shoulder.\n\nPhilip started; he had been so occupied with his search and his wild\nchasing thoughts, that he had not heard the sound of an approaching\nfootstep. He looked up and beheld the Father Seysen, the priest of the\nlittle parish, with his eyes sternly fixed upon him. The good man had\nbeen informed of the dangerous state of the widow Vanderdecken, and\nhad risen at daylight to visit and afford her spiritual comfort.\n\n\"How now, my son,\" said the priest: \"fearest thou not to disturb thy\nmother's rest? and wouldst thou pilfer and purloin even before she is\nin her grave?\"\n\n\"I fear not to disturb my mother's rest, good father,\" replied Philip,\nrising on his feet, \"for she now rests with the blessed. Neither do I\npilfer or purloin. It is not gold I seek, although if gold there were,\nthat gold would now be mine. I seek but a key, long hidden, I believe,\nwithin this secret drawer, the opening of which is a mystery beyond my\nart.\"\n\n\"Thy mother is no more, sayest thou, my son? and dead without\nreceiving the rites of our most holy church! Why didst thou not send\nfor me?\"\n\n\"She died, good father, suddenly--most suddenly, in these arms, about\ntwo hours ago. I fear not for her soul, although I can but grieve you\nwere not at her side.\"\n\nThe priest gently opened the curtains, and looked upon the corpse. He\nsprinkled holy water on the bed, and for a short time his lips were\nseen to move in silent prayer. He then turned round to Philip.\n\n\"Why do I see thee thus employed? and why so anxious to obtain that\nkey? A mother's death should call forth filial tears and prayers for\nher repose. Yet are thine eyes dry, and thou art employed upon an\nindifferent search while yet the tenement is warm which but now held\nher spirit. This is not seemly, Philip. What is the key thou seekest?\"\n\n\"Father, I have no time for tears--no time to spare for grief or\nlamentation. I have much to do and more to think of than thought can\nwell embrace. That I loved my mother, you know well.\"\n\n\"But the key thou seekest, Philip?\"\n\n\"Father, it is the key of a chamber which has not been unlocked for\nyears, which I must--will open; even if--\"\n\n\"If what, my son?\"\n\n\"I was about to say what I should not have said. Forgive me, Father; I\nmeant that I must search that chamber.\"\n\n\"I have long heard of that same chamber being closed; and that thy\nmother would not explain wherefore, I know well, for I have asked\nher, and have been denied. Nay, when, as in duty bound, I pressed the\nquestion, I found her reason was disordered by my importunity, and\ntherefore I abandoned the attempt. Some heavy weight was on thy\nmother's mind, my son, yet would she never confess or trust it with\nme. Tell me, before she died, hadst thou this secret from her?\"\n\n\"I had, most holy father.\"\n\n\"Wouldst thou not feel comfort if thou didst confide to me, my son? I\nmight advise--assist--\"\n\n\"Father, I would indeed--I could confide it to thee, and ask for thy\nassistance--I know 'tis not from curious feeling thou wouldst have it,\nbut from a better motive. But of that which has been told it is not\nyet manifest--whether it is as my poor mother says, or but the phantom\nof a heated brain. Should it indeed be true, fain would I share the\nburthen with you--yet little you might thank me for the heavy load.\nBut no--at least not now--it must not, cannot be revealed. I must do\nmy work--enter that hated room alone.\"\n\n\"Fearest thou not?\"\n\n\"Father, I fear nothing. I have a duty to perform--a dreadful one, I\ngrant; but I pray thee, ask no more; for, like my poor mother, I feel\nas if the probing of the wound would half unseat my reason.\"\n\n\"I will not press thee further, Philip. The time may come when I may\nprove of service. Farewell, my child; but I pray thee to discontinue\nthy unseemly labour, for I must send in the neighbours to perform the\nduties to thy departed mother, whose soul I trust is with its God.\"\n\nThe priest looked at Philip; he perceived that his thoughts were\nelsewhere; there was a vacancy and appearance of mental stupefaction,\nand as he turned away, the good man shook his head.\n\n\"He is right,\" thought Philip, when once more alone; and he took up\nthe cabinet, and placed it upon the stand. \"A few hours more can make\nno difference: I will lay me down, for my head is giddy.\"\n\nPhilip went into the adjoining room, threw himself upon his bed, and\nin a few minutes was in a sleep as sound as that permitted to the\nwretch a few hours previous to his execution.\n\nDuring his slumbers the neighbours had come in, and had prepared\neverything for the widow's interment. They had been careful not to\nwake the son, for they held as sacred the sleep of those who must\nwake up to sorrow. Among others, soon after the hour of noon arrived\nMynheer Poots; he had been informed of the death of the widow, but\nhaving a spare hour, he thought he might as well call, as it would\nraise his charges by another guilder. He first went into the room\nwhere the body lay, and from thence he proceeded to the chamber of\nPhilip, and shook him by the shoulder.\n\nPhilip awoke, and, sitting up, perceived the doctor standing by him.\n\n\"Well, Mynheer Vanderdecken,\" commenced the unfeeling little man, \"so\nit's all over. I knew it would be so, and recollect you owe me now\nanother guilder, and you promised faithfully to pay me; altogether,\nwith the potion, it will be three guilders and a half--that is,\nprovided you return my phial.\"\n\nPhilip, who at first waking was confused, gradually recovered his\nsenses during this address.\n\n\"You shall have your three guilders and a half, and your phial to\nboot, Mr Poots,\" replied he, as he rose from off the bed.\n\n\"Yes, yes; I know you mean to pay me--if you can. But look you,\nMynheer Philip, it may be some time before you sell the cottage. You\nmay not find a customer. Now, I never wish to be hard upon people who\nhave no money, and I'll tell you what I'll do. There is a something\non your mother's neck. It is of no value, none at all, but to a good\nCatholic. To help you in your strait, I will take that thing, and then\nwe shall be quits. You will have paid me, and there will be an end of\nit.\"\n\nPhilip listened calmly: he knew to what the little miser had\nreferred,--the relic on his mother's neck--that very relic upon which\nhis father swore the fatal oath. He felt that millions of guilders\nwould not have induced him to part with it.\n\n\"Leave the house,\" answered he abruptly. \"Leave it immediately. Your\nmoney shall be paid.\"\n\nNow, Mynheer Poots, in the first place, knew that the setting of the\nrelic, which was in a square frame of pure gold, was worth much more\nthan the sum due to him: he also knew that a large price had been paid\nfor the relic itself, and as at that time such a relic was considered\nvery valuable, he had no doubt but that it would again fetch a\nconsiderable sum. Tempted by the sight of it when he entered the\nchamber of death, he had taken it from the neck of the corpse, and it\nwas then actually concealed in his bosom, so he replied--\n\n\"My offer is a good one, Mynheer Philip, and you had better take it.\nOf what use is such trash?\"\n\n\"I tell you, no,\" cried Philip, in a rage.\n\n\"Well, then, you will let me have it in my possession till I am paid,\nMynheer Vanderdecken--that is but fair. I must not lose my money. When\nyou bring me my three guilders and a half and the phial, I will return\nit to you.\"\n\nPhilip's indignation was now without bounds. He seized Mynheer Poots\nby the collar, and threw him out of the door. \"Away immediately,\"\ncried he, \"or by--\"\n\nThere was no occasion for Philip to finish the imprecation. The doctor\nhad hastened away with such alarm, that he fell down half the steps\nof the staircase, and was limping away across the bridge. He almost\nwished that the relic had not been in his possession; but his sudden\nretreat had prevented him, even if so inclined, from replacing it on\nthe corpse.\n\nThe result of this conversation naturally turned Philip's thoughts to\nthe relic, and he went into his mother's room to take possession of\nit. He opened the curtains--the corpse was laid out--he put forth his\nhand to untie the black ribbon. It was not there. \"Gone!\" exclaimed\nPhilip. \"They hardly would have removed it--never would--. It must\nbe that villain Poots--wretch; but I will have it, even if he has\nswallowed it, though I tear him limb from limb!\"\n\nPhilip darted down the stairs, rushed out of the house, cleared the\nmoat at one bound, and without coat or hat, flew away in the direction\nof the doctor's lonely residence. The neighbours saw him as he passed\nthem like the wind; they wondered, and they shook their heads. Mynheer\nPoots was not more than half-way to his home, for he had hurt his\nankle. Apprehensive of what might possibly take place should his theft\nbe discovered, he occasionally looked behind him; at length, to his\nhorror, he beheld Philip Vanderdecken at a distance bounding on in\npursuit of him. Frightened almost out of his senses, the wretched\npilferer hardly knew how to act; to stop and surrender up the stolen\nproperty was his first thought, but fear of Vanderdecken's violence\nprevented him; so he decided on taking to his heels, thus hoping to\ngain his house, and barricade himself in, by which means he would be\nin a condition to keep possession of what he had stolen, or at least\nmake some terms ere he restored it.\n\nMynheer Poots had need to run fast, and so he did; his thin legs\nbearing his shrivelled form rapidly over the ground; but Philip, who,\nwhen he witnessed the doctor's attempt to escape, was fully convinced\nthat he was the culprit, redoubled his exertions, and rapidly came up\nwith the chase. When within a hundred yards of his own door, Mynheer\nPoots heard the bounding step of Philip gain upon him, and he sprang\nand leaped in his agony. Nearer and nearer still the step, until at\nlast he heard the very breathing of his pursuer, and Poots shrieked in\nhis fear, like the hare in the jaws of the greyhound. Philip was not\na yard from him; his arm was outstretched, when the miscreant dropped\ndown paralysed with terror, and the impetus of Vanderdecken was so\ngreat that he passed over his body, tripped, and after trying in vain\nto recover his equilibrium, he fell and rolled over and over. This\nsaved the little doctor; it was like the double of a hare. In a second\nhe was again on his legs, and before Philip could rise and again exert\nhis speed, Poots had entered his door and bolted it within. Philip\nwas, however, determined to repossess the important treasure; and as\nhe panted, he cast his eyes around, to see if any means offered for\nhis forcing his entrance into the house. But as the habitation of the\ndoctor was lonely, every precaution had been taken by him to render\nit secure against robbery; the windows below were well barricaded and\nsecured, and those on the upper story were too high for anyone to\nobtain admittance by them.\n\nWe must here observe, that although Mynheer Poots was, from his\nknown abilities, in good practice, his reputation as a hard-hearted,\nunfeeling miser was well established. No one was ever permitted to\nenter his threshold, nor, indeed, did any one feel inclined. He was as\nisolated from his fellow-creatures as was his tenement, and was only\nto be seen in the chamber of disease and death. What his establishment\nconsisted of no one knew. When he first settled in the neighbourhood,\nan old decrepit woman occasionally answered the knocks given at the\ndoor by those who required the doctor's services; but she had been\nburied some time, and, ever since, all calls at the door had been\nanswered by Mynheer Poots in person, if he were at home, and if not,\nthere was no reply to the most importunate summons. It was then\nsurmised that the old man lived entirely by himself, being too\nniggardly to pay for any assistance. This Philip also imagined; and as\nsoon as he had recovered his breath, he began to devise some scheme by\nwhich he would be enabled not only to recover the stolen property, but\nalso to wreak a dire revenge.\n\nThe door was strong, and not to be forced by any means which presented\nthemselves to the eye of Vanderdecken. For a few minutes he paused\nto consider, and as he reflected, so did his anger cool down, and\nhe decided that it would be sufficient to recover his relic without\nhaving recourse to violence. So he called out in a loud voice:--\n\n\"Mynheer Poots, I know that you can hear me. Give me back what you\nhave taken, and I will do you no hurt; but if you will not, you must\ntake the consequence, for your life shall pay the forfeit before I\nleave this spot.\"\n\nThis speech was indeed very plainly heard by Mynheer Poots, but the\nlittle miser had recovered from his fright, and, thinking himself\nsecure, could not make up his mind to surrender the relic without a\nstruggle; so the doctor answered not, hoping that the patience of\nPhilip would be exhausted, and that by some arrangement, such as\nthe sacrifice of a few guilders, no small matter to one so needy as\nPhilip, he would be able to secure what he was satisfied would sell at\na high price.\n\nVanderdecken, finding that no answer was returned, indulged in strong\ninvective, and then decided upon measures certainly in themselves by\nno means undecided.\n\nThere was part of a small stack of dry fodder standing not far from\nthe house, and under the wall a pile of wood for firing. With these\nVanderdecken resolved upon setting fire to the house, and thus, if he\ndid not gain his relic, he would at least obtain ample revenge. He\nbrought several armfuls of fodder and laid them at the door of the\nhouse, and upon that he piled the fagots and logs of wood, until the\ndoor was quite concealed by them. He then procured a light from the\nsteel, flint, and tinder, which every Dutchman carries in his pocket,\nand very soon he had fanned the pile into a flame. The smoke ascended\nin columns up to the rafters of the roof while the fire raged below.\nThe door was ignited, and was adding to the fury of the flames, and\nPhilip shouted with joy at the success of his attempt.\n\n\"Now, miserable despoiler of the dead--now, wretched thief, now you\nshall feel my vengeance,\" cried Philip, with a loud voice. \"If you\nremain within, you perish in the flames; if you attempt to come out\nyou shall die by my hands. Do you hear, Mynheer Poots--do you hear?\"\n\nHardly had Philip concluded this address when the window of the upper\nfloor furthest from the burning door was thrown open.\n\n\"Ay,--you come now to beg and to entreat; but no--no,\" cried\nPhilip--who stopped as he beheld at the window what seemed to be an\napparition, for, instead of the wretched little miser, he beheld\none of the loveliest forms Nature ever deigned to mould--an angelic\ncreature, of about sixteen or seventeen, who appeared calm and\nresolute in the midst of the danger by which she was threatened. Her\nlong black hair was braided and twined round her beautifully-formed\nhead; her eyes were large, intensely dark, yet soft; her forehead high\nand white, her chin dimpled, her ruby lips arched and delicately\nfine, her nose small and straight. A lovelier face could not be well\nimagined; it reminded you of what the best of painters have sometimes,\nin their more fortunate moments, succeeded in embodying, when they\nwould represent a beauteous saint. And as the flames wreathed and the\nsmoke burst out in columns and swept past the window, so might she\nhave reminded you in her calmness of demeanour of some martyr at the\nstake.\n\n\"What wouldst thou, violent young man? Why are the inmates of this\nhouse to suffer death by your means?\" said the maiden, with composure.\n\nFor a few seconds Philip gazed, and could make no reply; then the\nthought seized him that, in his vengeance, he was about to sacrifice\nso much loveliness. He forgot everything but her danger, and seizing\none of the large poles which he had brought to feed the flame, he\nthrew off and scattered in every direction the burning masses, until\nnothing was left which could hurt the building but the ignited door\nitself; and this, which as yet--for it was of thick oak plank--had not\nsuffered very material injury, he soon reduced, by beating it, with\nclods of earth, to a smoking and harmless state. During these active\nmeasures on the part of Philip, the young maiden watched him in\nsilence.\n\n\"All is safe now, young lady,\" said Philip. \"God forgive me that I\nshould have risked a life so precious. I thought but to wreak my\nvengeance upon Mynheer Poots.\"\n\n\"And what cause can Mynheer Poots have given for such dreadful\nvengeance?\" replied the maiden calmly.\n\n\"What cause, young lady? He came to my house--despoiled the dead--took\nfrom my mother's corpse a relic beyond price.\"\n\n\"Despoiled the dead!--he surely cannot--you must wrong him, young\nsir.\"\n\n\"No, no. It is the fact, lady,--and that relic--forgive me--but that\nrelic I must have. You know not what depends upon it.\"\n\n\"Wait, young sir,\" replied the maiden; \"I will soon return.\"\n\nPhilip waited several minutes, lost in thought and admiration: so fair\na creature in the house of Mynheer Poots! Who could she be? While thus\nruminating, he was accosted by the silver voice of the object of his\nreveries, who, leaning out of the window, held in her hand the black\nribbon to which was attached the article so dearly coveted.\n\n\"Here is your relic, sir,\" said the young female; \"I regret much that\nmy father should have done a deed which well might justify your anger:\nbut here it is,\" continued she, dropping it down on the ground by\nPhilip; \"and now you may depart.\"\n\n\"Your father, maiden! can he be your _father_?\" said Philip,\nforgetting to take up the relic which lay at his feet.\n\nShe would have retired from the window without reply, but Philip spoke\nagain--\n\n\"Stop, lady, stop one moment, until I beg your forgiveness for my\nwild, foolish act. I swear by this sacred relic,\" continued he, taking\nit from the ground and raising it to his lips, \"that had I known that\nany unoffending person had been in this house, I would not have done\nthe deed, and much do I rejoice that no harm hath happened. But there\nis still danger, lady; the door must be unbarred, and the jambs, which\nstill are glowing, be extinguished, or the house may yet be burnt.\nFear not for your father, maiden, for had he done me a thousand times\nmore wrong, you will protect each hair upon his head. He knows me well\nenough to know I keep my word. Allow me to repair the injury I have\noccasioned, and then I will depart.\"\n\n\"No, no; don't trust him,\" said Mynheer Poots, from within the\nchamber.\n\n\"Yes, he may be trusted,\" replied the daughter; \"and his services are\nmuch needed, for what could a poor weak girl like me, and a still\nweaker father, do in this strait? Open the door, and let the house be\nmade secure.\" The maiden then addressed Philip--\"He shall open the\ndoor, sir, and I will thank you for your kind service. I trust\nentirely to your promise.\"\n\n\"I never yet was known to break my word, maiden,\" replied Philip; \"but\nlet him be quick, for the flames are bursting out again.\"\n\nThe door was opened by the trembling hands of Mynheer Poots, who then\nmade a hasty retreat upstairs. The truth of what Philip had said was\nthen apparent. Many were the buckets of water which he was obliged to\nfetch before the fire was subdued; but during his exertions neither\nthe daughter nor the father made their appearance.\n\nWhen all was safe, Philip closed the door, and again looked up at the\nwindow. The fair girl made her appearance, and Philip, with a low\nobeisance, assured her that there was then no danger.\n\n\"I thank you, sir,\" replied she--\"I thank you much. Your conduct,\nalthough hasty at first, has yet been most considerate.\"\n\n\"Assure your father, maiden, that all animosity on my part hath\nceased, and that in a few days I will call and satisfy the demand he\nhath against me.\"\n\nThe window closed, and Philip, more excited, but with feelings\naltogether different from those with which he had set out, looked at\nit for a minute, and then bent his steps to his own cottage.\n\n\n\n\nChapter III\n\n\nThe discovery of the beautiful daughter of Mynheer Poots had made a\nstrong impression upon Philip Vanderdecken, and now he had another\nexcitement to combine with those which already overcharged his bosom.\nHe arrived at his own house, went upstairs, and threw himself on the\nbed from which he had been roused by Mynheer Poots. At first, he\nrecalled to his mind the scene we have just described, painted in his\nimagination the portrait of the fair girl, her eyes, her expression,\nher silver voice, and the words which she had uttered; but her\npleasing image was soon chased away by the recollection that his\nmother's corpse lay in the adjoining chamber, and that his father's\nsecret was hidden in the room below.\n\nThe funeral was to take place the next morning, and Philip, who, since\nhis meeting with the daughter of Mynheer Poots, appeared even to\nhimself not so anxious for immediate examination of the room, resolved\nthat he would not open it until after the melancholy ceremony. With\nthis resolution he fell asleep; and exhausted with bodily and mental\nexcitement, he did not wake until the next morning, when he was\nsummoned by the priest to assist at the funeral rites. In an hour all\nwas over; the crowd dispersed, and Philip, returning to the cottage,\nbolted the door that he might not be interrupted, and felt happy that\nhe was alone.\n\nThere is a feeling in our nature which will arise when we again find\nourselves in the tenement where death has been, and all traces of\nit have been removed. It is a feeling of satisfaction and relief at\nhaving rid ourselves of the memento of mortality, the silent evidence\nof the futility of our pursuits and anticipations. We know that we\nmust one day die, but we always wish to forget it. The continual\nremembrance would be too great a check upon our mundane desires and\nwishes; and although we are told that we ever should have futurity in\nour thoughts, we find that life is not to be enjoyed if we are not\npermitted occasional forgetfulness. For who would plan what rarely\nhe is permitted to execute, if each moment of the day he thought of\ndeath? We either hope that we may live longer than others, or we\nforget that we may not.\n\nIf this buoyant feeling had not been planted in our nature, how little\nwould the world have been improved even from the deluge! Philip walked\ninto the room where his mother had lain one short hour before, and\nunwittingly felt relief. Taking down the cabinet, he now recommenced\nhis task; the back panel was soon removed, and a secret drawer\ndiscovered; he drew it out, and it contained what he presumed to be\nthe object of his search,--a large key with a slight coat of rust upon\nit, which came off upon its being handled. Under the key was a paper,\nthe writing on which was somewhat discoloured; it was in his mother's\nhand, and ran as follows:--\n\n\"It is now two nights since a horrible event took place which has\ninduced me to close the lower chamber, and my brain is still bursting\nwith terror. Should I not, during my lifetime, reveal what occurred,\nstill this key will be required, as at my death the room will be\nopened. When I rushed from it I hastened upstairs, and remained that\nnight with my child; the next morning I summoned up sufficient courage\nto go down, turn the key, and bring it up into my chamber. It is now\nclosed till I close my eyes in death. No privation, no suffering,\nshall induce me to open it, although in the iron cupboard under the\nbuffet farthest from the window, there is money sufficient for all my\nwants; that money will remain there for my child, to whom, if I do not\nimpart the fatal secret, he must be satisfied that it is one which it\nwere better should be concealed,--one so horrible as to induce me to\ntake the steps which I now do. The keys of the cupboards and buffets\nwere, I think, lying on the table, or in my workbox, when I quitted\nthe room. There is a letter on the table, at least I think so. It\nis sealed. Let not the seal be broken but by my son, and not by him\nunless he knows the secret. Let it be burnt by the priest,--for it\nis cursed;--and even should my son know all that I do, oh! let him\npause,--let him reflect well before he breaks the seal,--for 'twere\nbetter he should know NO MORE!\"\n\n\"Not know more!\" thought Philip, as his eyes were still fixed upon the\npaper. \"Yes, but I must and will know more! so forgive me, dearest\nmother, if I waste no time in reflection. It would be but time thrown\naway, when one is resolved as I am.\"\n\nPhilip pressed his lips to his mother's signature, folded up the\npaper, and put it into his pocket; then, taking the key, he proceeded\ndownstairs.\n\nIt was about noon when Philip descended to open the chamber; the sun\nshone bright, the sky was clear, and all without was cheerful and\njoyous. The front door of the cottage being closed, there was not much\nlight in the passage when Philip put the key into the lock of the\nlong-closed door, and with some difficulty turned it round. To say\nthat when he pushed open the door he felt no alarm, would not be\ncorrect; he did feel alarm, and his heart palpitated; but he felt more\nthan was requisite of determination to conquer that alarm, and to\nconquer more, should more be created by what he should behold. He\nopened the door, but did not immediately enter the room: he paused\nwhere he stood, for he felt as if he was about to intrude into the\nretreat of a disembodied spirit, and that that spirit might reappear.\nHe waited a minute, for the effort of opening the door had taken away\nhis breath, and, as he recovered himself, he looked within.\n\nHe could but imperfectly distinguish the objects in the chamber, but\nthrough the joints of the shutters there were three brilliant beams of\nsunshine forcing their way across the room, which at first induced him\nto recoil as if from something supernatural; but a little reflection\nreassured him. After about a minute's pause, Philip went into the\nkitchen, lighted a candle, and, sighing deeply two or three times\nas if to relieve his heart, he summoned his resolution, and walked\ntowards the fatal room. He first stopped at the threshold, and, by the\nlight of the candle, took a hasty survey. All was still: and the\ntable on which the letter had been left, being behind the door, was\nconcealed by its being opened. It must be done, thought Philip: and\nwhy not at once? continued he, resuming his courage; and, with a firm\nstep, he walked into the room and went to unfasten the shutters. If\nhis hands trembled a little when he called to mind how supernaturally\nthey had last been opened, it is not surprising. We are but mortal,\nand we shrink from contact with aught beyond this life. When the\nfastenings were removed and the shutters unfolded, a stream of light\npoured into the room so vivid as to dazzle his eyesight; strange to\nsay, this very light of a brilliant day overthrew the resolution of\nPhilip more than the previous gloom and darkness had done; and with\nthe candle in his hand, he retreated hastily into the kitchen to\nre-summon his courage, and there he remained for some minutes, with\nhis face covered, and in deep thought.\n\nIt is singular that his reveries at last ended by reverting to the\nfair daughter of Mynheer Poots, and her first appearance at the\nwindow; and he felt as if the flood of light which had just driven\nhim from the one, was not more impressive and startling than her\nenchanting form at the other. His mind dwelling upon the beauteous\nvision appeared to restore Philip's confidence; he now rose and boldly\nwalked into the room. We shall not describe the objects it contained\nas they chanced to meet the eyes of Philip, but attempt a more lucid\narrangement.\n\nThe room was about twelve or fourteen feet square, with but one\nwindow; opposite to the door stood the chimney and fireplace, with a\nhigh buffet of dark wood on each side. The floor of the room was not\ndirty, although about its upper parts spiders had run their cobwebs\nin every direction. In the centre of the ceiling, hung a quicksilver\nglobe, a common ornament in those days, but the major part of it had\nlost its brilliancy, the spiders' webs enclosing it like a shroud.\nOver the chimney piece were hung two or three drawings framed and\nglazed, but a dusty mildew was spotted over the glass, so that little\nof them could be distinguished. In the centre of the mantel-piece was\nan image of the Virgin Mary, of pure silver, in a shrine of the same\nmetal, but it was tarnished to the colour of bronze or iron; some\nIndian figures stood on each side of it. The glass doors of the\nbuffets on each side of the chimney-piece were also so dimmed that\nlittle of what was within could be distinguished; the light and heat\nwhich had been poured into the room, even for so short a time, had\nalready gathered up the damp of many years, and it lay as a mist and\nmingled with the dust upon the panes of glass: still here and there a\nglittering of silver vessels could be discerned, for the glass doors\nhad protected them from turning black, although much dimmed in lustre.\n\nOn the wall facing the window were other prints, in frames equally\nveiled in damp and cobwebs, and also two bird-cages. The bird-cages\nPhilip approached, and looked into them. The occupants, of course, had\nlong been dead; but at the bottom of the cages was a small heap of\nyellow feathers, through which the little white bones of the skeletons\nwere to be seen, proving that they had been brought from the Canary\nIsles; and, at that period, such birds were highly valued. Philip\nappeared to wish to examine everything before he sought that which\nhe most dreaded, yet most wished, to find. There were several chairs\nround the room: on one of them was some linen; he took it up. It was\nsome that must have belonged to him when he was yet a child. At last,\nPhilip turned his eyes to the wall not yet examined (that opposite the\nchimney-piece), through which the door was pierced, and behind the\ndoor as it lay open, he was to find the table, the couch, the workbox,\nand the FATAL LETTER. As he turned round, his pulse, which had\ngradually recovered its regular motion, beat more quickly; but he made\nthe effort, and it was over. At first he examined the walls, against\nwhich were hung swords and pistols of various sorts, but chiefly\nAsiatic bows and arrows, and other implements of destruction. Philip's\neyes gradually descended upon the table, and little couch behind it,\nwhere his mother stated herself to have been seated when his father\nmade his awful visit. The workbox and all its implements were on the\ntable, just as she had left them. The keys she mentioned were also\nlying there, but Philip looked, and looked again; there was no letter.\nHe now advanced nearer, examined closely--there was none that he could\nperceive, either on the couch or on the table--or on the floor. He\nlifted up the workbox to ascertain if it was beneath--but no. He\nexamined among its contents, but no letter was there. He turned over\nthe pillows of the couch, but still there was no letter to be found.\nAnd Philip felt as if there had been a heavy load removed from his\npanting chest. \"Surely, then,\" thought he, as he leant against the\nwall, \"this must have been the vision of a heated imagination. My poor\nmother must have fallen asleep, and dreamt this horrid tale. I thought\nit was impossible, at least I hoped so. It must have been as I\nsuppose; the dream was too powerful, too like a fearful reality,\npartially unseated my poor mother's reason.\" Philip reflected again,\nand was then satisfied that his suppositions were correct.\n\n\"Yes, it must have been so, poor dear mother! how much thou hast\nsuffered! but thou art now rewarded, and with God.\"\n\nAfter a few minutes (during which he surveyed the room again and\nagain with more coolness, and perhaps some indifference, now that he\nregarded the supernatural history as not true), Philip took out of his\npocket the written paper found with the key, and read it over--\"The\niron cupboard under the buffet farthest from the window.\" \"'Tis well.\"\nHe took the bunch of keys from off the table, and soon fitted one to\nthe outside wooden doors which concealed the iron safe. A second\nkey on the bunch opened the iron doors; and Philip found himself in\npossession of a considerable sum of money, amounting, as near as he\ncould reckon, to ten thousand guilders, in little yellow sacks. \"My\npoor mother!\" thought he; \"and has a mere dream scared thee to penury\nand want, with all this wealth in thy possession?\" Philip replaced the\nsacks, and locked up the cupboards, after having taken out of one,\nalready half emptied, a few pieces for his immediate wants. His\nattention was next directed to the buffets above, which, with one\nof the keys, he opened; he found that they contained china, silver\nflagons, and cups of considerable value. The locks were again turned,\nand the bunch of keys thrown upon the table.\n\nThe sudden possession of so much wealth added to the conviction, to\nwhich Philip had now arrived, that there had been no supernatural\nappearance, as supposed by his mother, naturally revived and composed\nhis spirits; and he felt a reaction which amounted almost to hilarity.\nSeating himself on the couch, he was soon in a reverie, and as before,\nreverted to the lovely daughter of Mynheer Poots, indulging in various\ncastle-buildings, all ending, as usual, when we choose for ourselves,\nin competence and felicity. In this pleasing occupation he remained\nfor more than two hours, when his thoughts again reverted to his poor\nmother and her fearful death.\n\n\"Dearest, kindest mother!\" apostrophised Philip aloud, as he rose from\nhis leaning position, \"here thou wert, tired with watching over my\ninfant slumbers, thinking of my absent father and his dangers, working\nup thy mind and anticipating evil, till thy fevered sleep conjured up\nthis apparition. Yes, it must have been so, for see here, lying on the\nfloor, is the embroidery, as it fell from thy unconscious hands,\nand with that labour ceased thy happiness in this life. Dear, dear\nmother!\" continued he, a tear rolling down his cheek as he stooped to\npick up the piece of muslin, \"how much hast thou suffered when--God of\nHeaven!\" exclaimed Philip, as he lifted up the embroidery, starting\nback with violence, and overturning the table, \"God of Heaven and of\nJudgment, there is--there _is_,\" and Philip clasped his hands, and\nbowed his head in awe and anguish, as in a changed and fearful tone he\nmuttered forth--\"the LETTER!\"\n\nIt was but too true,--underneath the embroidery on the floor had lain\nthe fatal letter of Vanderdecken. Had Philip seen it on the table when\nhe first went into the room, and was prepared to find it, he would\nhave taken it up with some degree of composure; but to find it now,\nwhen he had persuaded himself that it was all an illusion on the part\nof his mother; when he had made up his mind that there had been no\nsupernatural agency; after he had been indulging in visions of future\nbliss and repose, was a shock that transfixed him where he stood, and\nfor some time he remained in his attitude of surprise and terror. Down\nat once fell the airy fabric of happiness which he had built up during\nthe last two hours; and as he gradually recovered from his alarm, his\nheart filled with melancholy forebodings. At last he dashed forward,\nseized the letter, and burst out of the fatal room.\n\n\"I cannot, dare not, read it here,\" exclaimed he: \"no, no, it must be\nunder the vault of high and offended Heaven, that the message must be\nreceived.\" Philip took his hat, and went out of the house; in calm\ndespair he locked the door, took out the key, and walked he knew not\nwhither.\n\n\n\n\nChapter IV\n\n\nIf the reader can imagine the feelings of a man who, sentenced\nto death, and having resigned himself to his fate, finds himself\nunexpectedly reprieved; who, having recomposed his mind after the\nagitation arising from a renewal of those hopes and expectations which\nhe had abandoned, once more dwells upon future prospects, and indulges\nin pleasing anticipations: we say, that if the reader can imagine\nthis, and then what would be that man's feelings when he finds that\nthe reprieve is revoked, and that he is to suffer, he may then form\nsome idea of the state of Philip's mind when he quitted the cottage.\n\nLong did he walk, careless in which direction, with the letter in his\nclenched hand, and his teeth firmly set. Gradually he became more\ncomposed: and out of breath with the rapidity of his motion, he sat\ndown upon a bank, and there he long remained, with his eyes riveted\nupon the dreaded paper, which he held with both his hands upon his\nknees.\n\nMechanically he turned the letter over; the seal was black. Philip\nsighed.--\"I cannot read it now,\" thought he, and he rose and continued\nhis devious way.\n\nFor another half-hour did Philip keep in motion, and the sun was not\nmany degrees above the horizon. Philip stopped and looked at it till\nhis vision failed. \"I could imagine that it was the eye of God,\"\nthought Philip, \"and perhaps it may be. Why then, merciful Creator, am\nI thus selected from so many millions to fulfil so dire a task?\"\n\nPhilip looked about him for some spot where he might be concealed from\nobservation--where he might break the seal, and read this mission from\na world of spirits. A small copse of brushwood, in advance of a grove\nof trees, was not far from where he stood. He walked to it, and sat\ndown, so as to be concealed from any passers-by. Philip once more\nlooked at the descending orb of day, and by degrees he became\ncomposed.\n\n\"It is thy will,\" exclaimed he; \"it is my fate, and both must be\naccomplished.\"\n\nPhilip put his hand to the seal,--his blood thrilled when he called\nto mind that it had been delivered by no mortal hand, and that it\ncontained the secret of one in judgment. He remembered that that one\nwas his father; and that it was only in the letter that there was\nhope,--hope for his poor father, whose memory he had been taught to\nlove, and who appealed for help.\n\n\"Coward that I am, to have lost so many hours!\" exclaimed Philip; \"yon\nsun appears as if waiting on the hill, to give me light to read.\"\n\nPhilip mused a short time; he was once more the daring Vanderdecken.\nCalmly he broke the seal, which bore the initials of his father's\nname, and read as follows:--\n\n    \"To CATHERINE.\n\n    \"One of those pitying spirits whose eyes rain tears for mortal\n    crimes has been permitted to inform me by what means alone my\n    dreadful doom may be averted.\n\n    \"Could I but receive on the deck of my own ship the holy relic\n    upon which I swore the fatal oath, kiss it in all humility, and\n    shed one tear of deep contrition on the sacred wood, I then might\n    rest in peace.\n\n    \"How this may be effected, or by whom so fatal a task will be\n    undertaken, I know not. O Catherine, we have a son--but, no, no,\n    let him not hear of me. Pray for me, and now, farewell.\n\n    \"I. VANDERDECKEN.\"\n\n\"Then it is true, most horribly true,\" thought Philip; \"and my father\nis even now IN LIVING JUDGMENT. And he points to me--to whom else\nshould he? Am I not his son, and is it not my duty?\n\n\"Yes, father,\" exclaimed Philip aloud, falling on his knees, \"you have\nnot written these lines in vain. Let me peruse them once more.\"\n\nPhilip raised up his hand; but although it appeared to him that he had\nstill hold of the letter, it was not there--he grasped nothing. He\nlooked on the grass to see if it had fallen--but no, there was no\nletter, it had disappeared. Was it a vision?--no, no, he had read\nevery word. \"Then it must be to me, and me alone, that the mission was\nintended. I accept the sign.\n\n\"Hear me, dear father,--if thou art so permitted,--and deign to hear\nme, gracious Heaven--hear the son who, by this sacred relic, swears\nthat he will avert your doom, or perish. To that will he devote his\ndays; and having done his duty, he will die in hope and peace. Heaven,\nthat recorded my rash father's oath, now register his son's upon\nthe same sacred cross, and may perjury on my part be visited with\npunishment more dire than his! Receive it, Heaven, as at the last I\ntrust that in thy mercy thou wilt receive the father and the son! and\nif too bold, O pardon my presumption.\"\n\nPhilip threw himself forward on his face, with his lips to the sacred\nsymbol. The sun went down, and twilight gradually disappeared; night\nhad, for some time, shrouded all in darkness, and Philip yet remained\nin alternate prayer and meditation.\n\nBut he was disturbed by the voices of some men, who sat down upon the\nturf but a few yards from where he was concealed. The conversation he\nlittle heeded; but it had roused him, and his first feeling was to\nreturn to the cottage, that he might reflect over his plans; but\nalthough the men spoke in a low tone, his attention was soon arrested\nby the subject of their conversation, when he heard the name mentioned\nof Mynheer Poots. He listened attentively, and discovered that they\nwere four disbanded soldiers, who intended that night to attack the\nhouse of the little doctor, who had, they knew, much money in his\npossession.\n\n\"What I have proposed is the best,\" said one of them; \"he has no one\nwith him but his daughter.\"\n\n\"I value her more than his money,\" replied another; \"so, recollect\nbefore we go, it is perfectly understood that she is to be my\nproperty.\"\n\n\"Yes, if you choose to purchase her, there's no objection,\" replied a\nthird.\n\n\"Agreed; how much will you in conscience ask for a puling girl?\"\n\n\"I say five hundred guilders,\" replied another.\n\n\"Well, be it so, but on this condition, that if my share of the booty\ndoes not amount to so much, I am to have her for my share, whatever it\nmay be.\"\n\n\"That's very fair,\" replied the other; \"but I'm much mistaken if\nwe don't turn more than two thousand guilders out of the old man's\nchest.\"\n\n\"What do you two say--is it agreed--shall Baetens have her?\"\n\n\"O yes,\" replied the others.\n\n\"Well, then,\" replied the one who had stipulated for Mynheer Poots'\ndaughter, \"now I am with you, heart and soul. I loved that girl, and\ntried to get her,--I positively offered to marry her, but the old\nhunks refused me, an ensign, an officer; but now I'll have revenge. We\nmust not spare him.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" replied the others.\n\n\"Shall we go now, or wait till it is later? In an hour or more the\nmoon will be up,--we may be seen.\"\n\n\"Who is to see us? unless, indeed, some one is sent for him. The later\nthe better, I say.\"\n\n\"How long will it take us to get there? Not half an hour, if we walk.\nSuppose we start in half an hour hence, we shall just have the moon to\ncount the guilders by.\"\n\n\"That's all right. In the meantime I'll put a new flint in my lock,\nand have my carbine loaded. I can work in the dark.\"\n\n\"You are used to it, Jan.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am,--and I intend this ball to go through the old rascal's\nhead.\"\n\n\"Well, I'd rather you should kill him than I,\" replied one of the\nothers, \"for he saved my life at Middleburgh, when everyone made sure\nI'd die.\"\n\nPhilip did not wait to hear any more; he crawled behind the bushes\nuntil he gained the grove of trees, and passing through them, made\na detour, so as not to be seen by these miscreants. That they were\ndisbanded soldiers, many of whom were infesting the country, he\nknew well. All his thoughts were now to save the old doctor and his\ndaughter from the danger which threatened them; and for a time he\nforgot his father, and the exciting revelations of the day. Although\nPhilip had not been aware in what direction he had walked when he set\noff from the cottage, he knew the country well; and now that it was\nnecessary to act, he remembered the direction in which he should find\nthe lonely house of Mynheer Poots: with the utmost speed he made his\nway for it, and in less than twenty minutes he arrived there, out of\nbreath.\n\nAs usual, all was silent, and the door fastened. Philip knocked, but\nthere was no reply. Again and again he knocked, and became impatient.\nMynheer Poots must have been summoned, and was not in the house;\nPhilip therefore called out, so as to be heard within. \"Maiden, if\nyour father is out, as I presume he must be, listen to what I have to\nsay--I am Philip Vanderdecken. But now I overheard four wretches who\nhave planned to murder your father, and rob him of his gold. In one\nhour or less they will be here, and I have hastened to warn and to\nprotect you, if I may. I swear upon the relic that you delivered to me\nthis morning that what I state is true.\"\n\nPhilip waited a short time, but received no answer.\n\n\"Maiden,\" resumed he, \"answer me, if you value that which is more dear\nto you, than even your father's gold to him. Open the casement above,\nand listen to what I have to say. In so doing there is no risk; and\neven if it were not dark, already have I seen you.\"\n\nA short time after this second address, the casement of the upper\nwindow was unbarred, and the slight form of the fair daughter of\nMynheer Poots was to be distinguished by Philip through the gloom.\n\n\"What wouldst thou, young sir, at this unseemly hour? and what is it\nthou wouldst impart, but imperfectly heard by me, when thou spokest\nthis minute at the door?\"\n\nPhilip then entered into a detail of all that he had overheard, and\nconcluded by begging her to admit him, that he might defend her.\n\n\"Think, fair maiden, of what I have told you. You have been sold\nto one of those reprobates, whose name I think they mentioned, was\nBaetens. The gold, I know, you value not; but think of thine own dear\nself--suffer me to enter the house, and think not for one moment that\nmy story's feigned. I swear to thee, by the soul of my poor dear\nmother, now, I trust, in heaven, that every word is true.\"\n\n\"Baetens, said you, sir?\"\n\n\"If I mistook them not, such was the name; he said he loved you once.\"\n\n\"That name I have in memory--I know not what to do or what to say--my\nfather has been summoned to a birth, and may be yet away for many\nhours. Yet how can I open the door to you--at night--he is not at\nhome--I alone? I ought not--cannot--yet do I believe you. You surely\nnever could be so base as to invent this tale.\"\n\n\"No--upon my hopes of future bliss I could not, maiden! You must not\ntrifle with your life and honour, but let me in.\"\n\n\"And if I did, what could you do against such numbers? They are four\nto one--would soon overpower you, and one more life would be lost.\"\n\n\"Not if you have arms; and I think your father would not be left\nwithout them. I fear them not--you know that I am resolute.\"\n\n\"I do indeed--and now you'd risk your life for those you did assail. I\nthank you--thank you kindly, sir--but dare not open the door.\"\n\n\"Then, maiden, if you'll not admit me, here will I now remain; without\narms, and but ill able to contend with four armed villains; but still,\nhere will I remain and prove my truth to one I will protect against\nany odds--yes, even here!\"\n\n\"Then shall I be thy murderer!--but that must not be. Oh! sir--swear,\nswear by all that's holy, and by all that's pure, that you do not\ndeceive me.\"\n\n\"I swear by thyself, maiden, than all to me more sacred!\"\n\nThe casement closed, and in a short time a light appeared above. In a\nminute or two more the door was opened to Philip by the fair daughter\nof Mynheer Poots. She stood with the candle in her right hand, the\ncolour in her cheeks varying--now flushing red, and again deadly pale.\nHer left hand was down by her side, and in it she held a pistol half\nconcealed. Philip perceived this precaution on her part but took no\nnotice of it; he wished to reassure her.\n\n\"Maiden!\" said he, not entering, \"if you still have doubts--if you\nthink you have been ill-advised in giving me admission--there is yet\ntime to close the door against me: but for your own sake I entreat you\nnot. Before the moon is up, the robbers will be here. With my life I\nwill protect you, if you will but trust me. Who indeed could injure\none like you?\"\n\nShe was indeed (as she stood irresolute and perplexed from the\npeculiarity of her situation, yet not wanting in courage when, it was\nto be called forth) an object well worthy of gaze and admiration. Her\nfeatures thrown into broad light and shade by the candle which at\ntimes was half extinguished by the wind--her symmetry of form and\nthe gracefulness and singularity of her attire--were matter of\nastonishment to Philip. Her head was without covering, and her long\nhair fell in plaits behind her shoulders; her stature was rather\nunder the middle size, but her form perfect; her dress was simple but\nbecoming, and very different from that usually worn by the young women\nof the district. Not only her features but her dress would at once\nhave indicated to a traveller that she was of Arab blood, as was the\nfact.\n\nShe looked in Philip's face as she spoke--earnestly, as if she would\nhave penetrated into his inmost thoughts; but there was a frankness\nand honesty in his bearing, and a sincerity in his manly countenance,\nwhich reassured her. After a moment's hesitation she replied--\n\n\"Come in, sir; I feel that I can trust you.\"\n\nPhilip entered. The door was then closed and made secure.\n\n\"We have no time to lose, maiden,\" said Philip: \"but tell me your\nname, that I may address you as I ought.\"\n\n\"My name is Amine,\" replied she, retreating a little.\n\n\"I thank you for that little confidence; but I must not dally. What\narms have you in the house, and have you ammunition?\"\n\n\"Both. I wish that my father would come home.\"\n\n\"And so do I,\" replied Philip, \"devoutly wish he would, before these\nmurderers come; but not, I trust, while the attack is making, for\nthere's a carbine loaded expressly for his head, and if they make\nhim prisoner, they will not spare his life, unless his gold and your\nperson are given in ransom. But the arms, maiden--where are they?\"\n\n\"Follow me,\" replied Amine, leading Philip to an inner room on the\nupper floor. It was the sanctum of her father, and was surrounded with\nshelves filled with bottles and boxes of drugs. In one corner was an\niron chest, and over the mantel-piece were a brace of carbines and\nthree pistols.\n\n\"They are all loaded,\" observed Amine, pointing to them, and laying on\nthe table the one which she had held in her hand.\n\nPhilip took down the arms, and examined all the primings. He then took\nup from the table the pistol which Amine had laid there, and threw\nopen the pan. It was equally well prepared. Philip closed the pan, and\nwith a smile observed,\n\n\"So this was meant for me, Amine?\"\n\n\"No--not for you--but for a traitor, had one gained admittance.\"\n\n\"Now, maiden,\" observed Philip, \"I shall station myself at the\ncasement which you opened, but without a light in the room. You may\nremain here, and can turn the key for your security.\"\n\n\"You little know me,\" replied Amine. \"In that way at least I am not\nfearful; I must remain near you and reload the arms--a task in which I\nam well practised.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" replied Philip; \"you might be hurt.\"\n\n\"I may. But think you I will remain here idly, when I can assist one\nwho risks his life for me? I know my duty, sir, and I shall perform\nit.\"\n\n\"You must not risk your life, Amine,\" replied Philip; \"my aim will not\nbe steady, if I know that you're in danger. But I must take the arms\ninto the other chamber, for the time is come.\"\n\nPhilip, assisted by Amine, carried the carbines and pistols into the\nadjoining chamber; and Amine then left Philip, carrying with her the\nlight. Philip, as soon as he was alone, opened the casement and looked\nout--there was no one to be seen; he listened, but all was silent. The\nmoon was just rising above the distant hill, but her light was dimmed\nby fleecy clouds, and Philip watched for a few minutes; at length he\nheard a whispering below. He looked out, and could distinguish through\nthe dark the four expected assailants, standing close to the door of\nthe house. He walked away softly from the window, and went into the\nnext room to Amine, whom he found busy preparing the ammunition.\n\n\"Amine, they are at the door, in consultation. You can see them now,\nwithout risk. I thank them, for they will convince you that I have\ntold the truth.\"\n\nAmine, without reply, went into the front room and looked out of the\nwindow. She returned, and laying her hand upon Philip's arm, she\nsaid--\n\n\"Grant me your pardon for my doubts. I fear nothing now but that my\nfather may return too soon, and they seize him.\"\n\nPhilip left the room again, to make his reconnaissance. The robbers\ndid not appear to have made up their mind--the strength of the door\ndefied their utmost efforts, so they attempted stratagem. They\nknocked, and as there was no reply, they continued to knock louder and\nlouder: not meeting with success they held another consultation, and\nthe muzzle of a carbine was then put to the keyhole, and the piece\ndischarged. The lock of the door was blown off, but the iron bars\nwhich crossed the door within, above and below, still held it fast.\n\nAlthough Philip would have been justified in firing upon the robbers\nwhen he first perceived them in consultation at the door, still there\nis that feeling in a generous mind which prevents the taking away of\nlife, except from stern necessity; and this feeling made him withhold\nhis fire until hostilities had actually commenced. He now levelled one\nof the carbines at the head of the robber nearest to the door, who was\nbusy examining the effect which the discharge of the piece had made,\nand what further obstacles intervened. The aim was true, and the\nman fell dead, while the others started back with surprise at the\nunexpected retaliation. But in a second or two a pistol was discharged\nat Philip, who still remained leaning out of the casement, fortunately\nwithout effect; and the next moment he felt himself drawn away, so as\nto be protected from their fire. It was Amine, who, unknown to Philip,\nhad been standing by his side.\n\n\"You must not expose yourself, Philip,\" said she, in a low tone.\n\nShe called me Philip, thought he, but made no reply.\n\n\"They will be watching for you at the casement now,\" said Amine. \"Take\nthe other carbine, and go below in the passage. If the lock of the\ndoor is blown off, they may put their arms in perhaps, and remove the\nbars. I do not think they can, but I'm not sure; at all events, it is\nthere you should now be, as there they will not expect you.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" replied Philip, going down.\n\n\"But you must not fire more than once there; if another fall, there\nwill be but two to deal with, and they cannot watch the casement and\nforce admittance to. Go--I will reload the carbine.\"\n\nPhilip descended softly and without a light. He went up to the door\nand perceived that one of the miscreants, with his arms through the\nhole where the lock was blown off, was working at the upper iron bar,\nwhich he could just reach. He presented his carbine, and was about to\nfire the whole charge into the body of the man under his raised arm,\nwhen there was a report of fire-arms from the robbers outside.\n\n\"Amine has exposed herself,\" thought Philip, \"and may be hurt.\"\n\nThe desire of vengeance prompted him first to fire his piece through\nthe man's body, and then he flew up the stairs to ascertain the state\nof Amine. She was not at the casement; he darted into the inner room,\nand found her deliberately loading the carbine.\n\n\"My God! how you frightened me, Amine. I thought by their firing that\nyou had shown yourself at the window.\"\n\n\"Indeed I did not; but I thought that when you fired through the door\nthey might return your fire, and you be hurt; so I went to the side of\nthe casement and pushed out on a stick some of my father's clothes,\nand they who were watching for you fired immediately.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Amine! who could have expected such courage and such coolness\nin one so young and beautiful?\" exclaimed Philip, with surprise.\n\n\"Are none but ill-favoured people brave, then?\" replied Amine,\nsmiling.\n\n\"I did not mean that, Amine--but I am losing time. I must to the door\nagain. Give me that carbine, and reload this.\"\n\nPhilip crept downstairs that he might reconnoitre, but before he had\ngained the door he heard at a distance the voice of Mynheer Poots.\nAmine, who also heard it, was in a moment at his side with a loaded\npistol in each hand.\n\n\"Fear not, Amine,\" said Philip, as he unbarred the door, \"there are\nbut two, and your father shall be saved.\"\n\nThe door was opened, and Philip, seizing his carbine, rushed out; he\nfound Mynheer Poots on the ground between the two men, one of whom\nhad raised his knife to plunge it into his body, when the ball of the\ncarbine whizzed through his head. The last of the robbers closed with\nPhilip, and a desperate struggle ensued; it was, however, soon decided\nby Amine stepping forward and firing one of the pistols through the\nrobber's body.\n\nWe must here inform our readers that Mynheer Poots, when coming home,\nhad heard the report of fire-arms in the direction of his own house.\nThe recollection of his daughter and of his money--for to do him\njustice he did love her best--had lent him wings; he forgot that he\nwas a feeble old man and without arms; all he thought of was to gain\nhis habitation. On he came, reckless, frantic, and shouting, and\nrushed into the arms of the two robbers, who seized and would have\ndespatched him, had not Philip so opportunely come to his assistance.\n\nAs soon as the last robber fell, Philip disengaged himself and went to\nthe assistance of Mynheer Poots, whom he raised up in his arms, and\ncarried into the house as if he were an infant. The old man was still\nin a state of delirium from fear and previous excitement.\n\nIn a few minutes Mynheer Poots was more coherent.\n\n\"My daughter!\" exclaimed he--\"my daughter! where is she?\"\n\n\"She is here, father, and safe,\" replied Amine.\n\n\"Ah! my child is safe,\" said he, opening his eyes and staring. \"Yes,\nit is even so--and my money--my money--where is my money?\" continued\nhe, starting up.\n\n\"Quite safe, father.\"\n\n\"Quite safe--you say quite safe--are you sure of it?--let me see.\"\n\n\"There it is, father, as you may perceive, quite safe--thanks to one\nwhom you have not treated so well.\"\n\n\"Who--what do you mean?--Ah, yes, I see him now--'tis Philip\nVanderdecken--he owes me three guilders and a half, and there is a\nphial--did he save you--and my money, child?\"\n\n\"He did, indeed, at the risk of his life.\"\n\n\"Well, well, I will forgive him the whole debt--yes, the whole of it;\nbut--the phial is of no use to him--he must return that. Give me some\nwater.\"\n\nIt was some time before the old man could regain his perfect reason.\nPhilip left him with his daughter, and, taking a brace of loaded\npistols, went out to ascertain the fate of the four assailants. The\nmoon having climbed above the banks of clouds which had obscured her,\nwas now high in the heavens, shining bright, and he could distinguish\nclearly. The two men lying across the threshold of the door were quite\ndead. The others, who had seized upon Mynheer Poots, were still\nalive, but one was expiring and the other bled fast. Philip put a few\nquestions to the latter, but he either would not or could not make any\nreply; he removed their weapons and returned to the house, where he\nfound the old man attended by his daughter, in a state of comparative\ncomposure.\n\n\"I thank you, Philip Vanderdecken--I thank you much. You have saved my\ndear child, and my money--that is little, very little--for I am poor.\nMay you live long and happily!\"\n\nPhilip mused; the letter and his vow were, for the first time since he\nfell in with the robbers, recalled to his recollection, and a shade\npassed over his countenance.\n\n\"Long and happily--no, no,\" muttered he, with an involuntary shake of\nthe head.\n\n\"And I must thank you,\" said Amine, looking inquiringly in Philip's\nface. \"O, how much have I to thank you for!--and indeed I am\ngrateful.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, she is very grateful,\" interrupted the old man; \"but we are\npoor--very poor. I talked about my money because I have so little,\nand I cannot afford to lose it; but you shall not pay me the three\nguilders and a half--I am content to lose that, Mr Philip.\"\n\n\"Why should you lose even that, Mynheer Poots?--I promised to pay you,\nand will keep my word. I have plenty of money--thousands of guilders,\nand know not what to do with them.\"\n\n\"You--you--thousands of guilders!\" exclaimed Poots. \"Pooh, nonsense,\nthat won't do.\"\n\n\"I repeat to you, Amine,\" said Philip, \"that I have thousands of\nguilders: you know I would not tell you a falsehood.\"\n\n\"I believed you when you said so to my father,\" replied Amine.\n\n\"Then perhaps, as you have so much, and I am so very poor, Mr\nVanderdecken--\"\n\nBut Amine put her hand upon her father's lips, and the sentence was\nnot finished.\n\n\"Father,\" said Amine, \"it is time that we retire. You must leave us\nfor to-night, Philip.\"\n\n\"I will not,\" replied Philip; \"nor, you may depend upon it, will I\nsleep. You may both to bed in safety. It is indeed time that you\nretire--good-night, Mynheer Poots. I will but ask a lamp, and then I\nleave you--Amine, good-night.\"\n\n\"Good-night,\" said Amine, extending her hand, \"and many, many thanks.\"\n\n\"Thousands of guilders!\" muttered the old man, as Philip left the room\nand went below.\n\n\n\n\nChapter V\n\n\nPhilip Vanderdecken sat down at the porch of the door; he swept his\nhair from his forehead, which he exposed to the fanning of the breeze;\nfor the continued excitement of the last three days had left a fever\non his brain which made him restless and confused. He longed for\nrepose, but he knew that for him there was no rest. He had his\nforebodings--he perceived in the vista of futurity a long-continued\nchain of danger and disaster, even to death; yet he beheld it without\nemotion and without dread. He felt as if it were only three days\nthat he had begun to exist; he was melancholy, but not unhappy. His\nthoughts were constantly recurring to the fatal letter--its strange\nsupernatural disappearance seemed pointedly to establish its\nsupernatural origin, and that the mission had been intended for him\nalone; and the relic in his possession more fully substantiated the\nfact.\n\nIt is my fate, my duty, thought Philip. Having satisfactorily made up\nhis mind to these conclusions, his thoughts reverted to the beauty,\nthe courage, and presence of mind shown by Amine. And, thought he,\nas he watched the moon soaring high in the heavens, is this fair\ncreature's destiny to be interwoven with mine? The events of the last\nthree days would almost warrant the supposition. Heaven only knows,\nand Heaven's will be done. I have vowed, and my vow is registered,\nthat I will devote my life to the release of my unfortunate\nfather--but does that prevent my loving Amine?--No, no; the sailor on\nthe Indian seas must pass months and months on shore before he can\nreturn to his duty. My search must be on the broad ocean, but how\noften may I return? and why am I to be debarred the solace of a\nsmiling hearth?--and yet--do I right in winning the affections of one\nwho, if she loves, would, I am convinced, love so dearly, fondly,\ntruly--ought I to persuade her to mate herself with one whose life\nwill be so precarious? but is not every sailor's life precarious,\ndaring the angry waves, with but an inch of plank 'tween him and\ndeath? Besides, I am chosen to fulfil a task--and if so, what can hurt\nme, till in Heaven's own time it is accomplished? but then how soon,\nand how is it to end? in death! I wish my blood were cooler, that I\nmight reason better.\n\nSuch were the meditations of Philip Vanderdecken, and long did he\nrevolve such chances in his mind. At last the day dawned, and as he\nperceived the blush upon the horizon, less careful of his watch he\nslumbered where he sat. A slight pressure on the shoulder made him\nstart up and draw the pistol from his bosom. He turned round and\nbeheld Amine.\n\n\"And that pistol was intended for me,\" said Amine, smiling, repeating\nPhilip's words of the night before.\n\n\"For you, Amine?--yes, to defend you, if 'twere necessary, once more.\"\n\n\"I know it would--how kind of you to watch this tedious night after so\nmuch exertion and fatigue! but it is now broad day.\"\n\n\"Until I saw the dawn, Amine, I kept a faithful watch.\"\n\n\"But now retire and take some rest. My father is risen--you can lie\ndown on his bed.\"\n\n\"I thank you, but I feel no wish for sleep. There is much to do. We\nmust to the burgomaster and state the facts, and these bodies must\nremain where they are until the whole is known. Will your father go,\nAmine, or shall I?\"\n\n\"My father surely is the more proper person, as the proprietor of the\nhouse. You must remain; and if you will not sleep, you must take some\nrefreshment. I will go in and tell my father; he has already taken his\nmorning's meal.\"\n\nAmine went in, and soon returned with her father, who had consented\nto go to the burgomaster. He saluted Philip kindly as he came out;\nshuddered as he passed on one side to avoid stepping over the dead\nbodies, and went off at a quick pace to the adjacent town, where the\nburgomaster resided.\n\nAmine desired Philip to follow her, and they went into her father's\nroom, where, to his surprise, he found some coffee ready for him--at\nthat time a rarity, and one which Philip did not expect to find in the\nhouse of the penurious Mynheer Poots; but it was a luxury which, from\nhis former life, the old man could not dispense with.\n\nPhilip, who had not tasted food for nearly twenty-four hours, was not\nsorry to avail himself of what was placed before him. Amine sat down\nopposite to him, and was silent during his repast.\n\n\"Amine,\" said Philip at last, \"I have had plenty of time for\nreflection during this night, as I watched at the door. May I speak\nfreely?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" replied Amine. \"I feel assured that you will say nothing\nthat you should not say, or should not meet a maiden's ear.\"\n\n\"You do me justice, Amine. My thoughts have been upon you and your\nfather. You cannot stay in this lone habitation.\"\n\n\"I feel it is too lonely; that is, for his safety--perhaps for\nmine--but you know my father--the very loneliness suits him, the price\npaid for rent is little, and he is careful of his money.\"\n\n\"The man who would be careful of his money should place it in\nsecurity--here it is not secure. Now hear me, Amine. I have a cottage\nsurrounded, as you may have heard, by many others, which mutually\nprotect each other. That cottage I am about to leave--perhaps for\never; for I intend to sail by the first ship to the Indian seas.\"\n\n\"The Indian seas! why so?--did you not last night talk of thousands of\nguilders?\"\n\n\"I did, and they are there; but, Amine, I must go--it is my duty. Ask\nme no more, but listen to what I now propose. Your father must live in\nmy cottage; he must take care of it for me in my absence; he will do\nme a favour by consenting; and you must persuade him. You will there\nbe safe. He must also take care of my money for me. I want it not at\npresent--I cannot take it with me.\"\n\n\"My father is not to be trusted with the money of other people.\"\n\n\"Why does your father hoard? He cannot take his money with him when\nhe is called away. It must be all for you--and is not then my money\nsafe?\"\n\n\"Leave it then in my charge, and it will be safe; but why need you go\nand risk your life upon the water, when you have such ample means?\"\n\n\"Amine, ask not that question. It is my duty as a son, and more I\ncannot tell, at least at present.\"\n\n\"If it is your duty, I ask no more. It was not womanish curiosity--no,\nno--it was a better feeling, I assure you, which prompted me to put\nthe question.\"\n\n\"And what was the better feeling, Amine?\"\n\n\"I hardly know--many good feelings perhaps mixed up\ntogether--gratitude, esteem, respect, confidence, good-will. Are not\nthese sufficient?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, Amine, and much to gain upon so short an acquaintance;\nbut still I feel them all, and more, for you. If, then, you feel so\nmuch for me, do oblige me by persuading your father to leave this\nlonely house this day, and take up his abode in mine.\"\n\n\"And where do you intend to go yourself?\"\n\n\"If your father will not admit me as a boarder for the short time I\nremain here, I will seek some shelter elsewhere; but if he will, I\nwill indemnify him well--that is, if you raise no objection to my\nbeing for a few days in the house?\"\n\n\"Why should I? Our habitation is no longer safe, and you offer us a\nshelter. It were, indeed, unjust and most ungrateful to turn you out\nfrom beneath your own roof.\"\n\n\"Then persuade him, Amine. I will accept of nothing, but take it as\na favour; for I should depart in sorrow if I saw you not in\nsafety.--Will you promise me?\"\n\n\"I do promise to use my best endeavours--nay, I may as well say at\nonce it shall be so; for I know my influence. Here is my hand upon it.\nWill that content you?\"\n\nPhilip took the small hand extended towards him. His feelings overcame\nhis discretion; he raised it to his lips. He looked up to see if Amine\nwas displeased, and found her dark eye fixed upon him, as once before\nwhen she admitted him, as if she would see his thoughts--but the hand\nwas not withdrawn.\n\n\"Indeed, Amine,\" said Philip, kissing her hand once more, \"you may\nconfide in me.\"\n\n\"I hope--I think--nay, I am sure I may,\" at last replied she.\n\nPhilip released her hand. Amine returned to the seat, and for some\ntime remained silent and in a pensive attitude. Philip also had his\nown thoughts, and did not open his lips. At last Amine spoke.\n\n\"I think I have heard my father say that your mother was very poor--a\nlittle deranged; and that there was a chamber in the house which had\nbeen shut up for years.\"\n\n\"It was shut up till yesterday.\"\n\n\"And there you found your money? Did your mother not know of the\nmoney?\"\n\n\"She did, for she spoke of it on her death-bed.\"\n\n\"There must have been some potent reasons for not opening the\nchamber.\"\n\n\"There were.\"\n\n\"What were they, Philip?\" said Amine, in a soft and low tone of voice.\n\n\"I must not tell, at least I ought not. This must satisfy you--'twas\nthe fear of an apparition.\"\n\n\"What apparition?\"\n\n\"She said that my father had appeared to her.\"\n\n\"And did he, think you, Philip?\"\n\n\"I have no doubt that he did. But I can answer no more questions,\nAmine. The chamber is open now, and there is no fear of his\nreappearance.\"\n\n\"I fear not that,\" replied Amine, musing. \"But,\" continued she, \"is\nnot this connected with your resolution of going to sea?\"\n\n\"So far will I answer you, that it has decided me to go to sea; but I\npray you ask no more. It is painful to refuse you, and my duty forbids\nme to speak further.\"\n\nFor some minutes they were both silent, when Amine resumed--\n\n\"You were so anxious to possess that relic, that I cannot help\nthinking it has connection with the mystery. Is it not so?\"\n\n\"For the last time, Amine, I will answer your question--it has to do\nwith it: but now no more.\"\n\nPhilip's blunt and almost rude manner of finishing his speech was not\nlost upon Amine, who replied,\n\n\"You are so engrossed with other thoughts, that you have not felt the\ncompliment shown you by my taking such interest about you, sir.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do--I feel and thank you too, Amine. Forgive me, if I have\nbeen rude; but recollect, the secret is not mine--at least, I feel as\nif it were not. God knows, I wish I never had known it, for it has\nblasted all my hopes in life.\"\n\nPhilip was silent; and when he raised his eyes, he found that Amine's\nwere fixed upon him.\n\n\"Would you read my thoughts, Amine, or my secret?\"\n\n\"Your thoughts perhaps--your secret I would not; yet do I grieve\nthat it should oppress you so heavily as evidently it does. It must,\nindeed, be one of awe to bear down a mind like yours, Philip.\"\n\n\"Where did you learn to be so brave, Amine?\" said Philip, changing the\nconversation.\n\n\"Circumstances make people brave or otherwise; those who are\naccustomed to difficulty and danger fear them not.\"\n\n\"And where have you met with them, Amine?\"\n\n\"In the country where I was born, not in this dank and muddy land.\"\n\n\"Will you trust me with the story of your former life, Amine? I can be\nsecret, if you wish.\"\n\n\"That you can be secret perhaps, against my wish, you have already\nproved to me,\" replied Amine, smiling; \"and you have a claim to know\nsomething of the life you have preserved. I cannot tell you much, but\nwhat I can will be sufficient. My father, when a lad on board of a\ntrading vessel, was taken by the Moors, and sold as a slave to a\nHakim, or physician, of their country. Finding him very intelligent,\nthe Moor brought him up as an assistant, and it was under this man\nthat he obtained a knowledge of the art. In a few years he was equal\nto his master; but, as a slave, he worked not for himself. You know,\nindeed it cannot be concealed, my father's avarice. He sighed to\nbecome as wealthy as his master, and to obtain his freedom; he became\na follower of Mahomet, after which he was free, and practised for\nhimself. He took a wife from an Arab family, the daughter of a chief\nwhom he had restored to health, and he settled in the country. I was\nborn; he amassed wealth, and became much celebrated; but the son of a\nBey dying under his hands was the excuse for persecuting him. His head\nwas forfeited, but he escaped; not, however, without the loss of all\nhis beloved wealth. My mother and I went with him; he fled to the\nBedouins, with whom we remained some years. There I was accustomed\nto rapid marches, wild and fierce attacks, defeat and flight, and\noftentimes to indiscriminate slaughter. But the Bedouins paid not well\nfor my father's services, and gold was his idol. Hearing that the\nBey was dead, he returned to Cairo, where he again practised. He was\nallowed once more to amass until the heap was sufficient to excite\nthe cupidity of the new Bey; but this time he was fortunately made\nacquainted with the intentions of the ruler. He again escaped, with\na portion of his wealth, in a small vessel, and gained the Spanish\ncoast; but he never has been able to retain his money long. Before he\narrived in this country he had been robbed of almost all, and has now\nbeen for these three years laying up again. We were but one year\nat Middleburgh, and from thence removed to this place. Such is the\nhistory of my life, Philip.\"\n\n\"And does your father still hold the Mahomedan faith, Amine?\"\n\n\"I know not. I think he holds no faith whatever: at least he hath\ntaught me none. His god is gold.\"\n\n\"And yours?\"\n\n\"Is the God who made this beautiful world, and all which it\ncontains--the God of nature--name him as you will. This I feel,\nPhilip, but more I fain would know; there are so many faiths, but\nsurely they must be but different paths leading alike to heaven. Yours\nis the Christian faith, Philip. Is it the true one? But everyone calls\nhis own the true one, whatever his creed may be.\"\n\n\"It is the true and only one, Amine. Could I but reveal--I have such\ndreadful proofs--\"\n\n\"That your faith is true; then is it not your duty to reveal these\nproofs? Tell me, are you bound by any solemn obligation never to\nreveal?\"\n\n\"No, I am not; yet do I feel as if I were. But I hear voices--it must\nbe your father and the authorities--I must go down and meet them.\"\n\nPhilip rose, and went downstairs. Amine's eyes followed him as he\nwent, and she remained looking towards the door.\n\n\"Is it possible,\" said she, sweeping the hair from off her brow, \"so\nsoon,--yes, yes, 'tis even so. I feel that I would sooner share his\nhidden woe--his dangers--even death itself were preferable with him,\nthan ease and happiness with any other. And it shall be strange indeed\nif I do not. This night my father shall move into his cottage: I will\nprepare at once.\"\n\nThe report of Philip and Mynheer Poots was taken down by the\nauthorities, the bodies examined, and one or two of them recognised\nas well-known marauders. They were then removed by the order of the\nburgomaster. The authorities broke up their council, and Philip and\nMynheer Poots were permitted to return to Amine. It will not be\nnecessary to repeat the conversation which ensued: it will be\nsufficient to state that Poots yielded to the arguments employed by\nAmine and Philip, particularly the one of paying no rent. A conveyance\nfor the furniture and medicines was procured, and in the afternoon\nmost of the effects were taken away. It was not, however, till dusk\nthat the strong box of the doctor was put into the cart, and Philip\nwent with it as a protector. Amine also walked by the side of the\nvehicle, with her father. As may be supposed, it was late that night\nbefore they had made their arrangements, and had retired to rest.\n\n\n\n\nChapter VI\n\n\n\"This, then, is the chamber which has so long been closed,\" said\nAmine, on entering it the next morning, long before Philip had\nawakened from the sound sleep produced by the watching of the night\nbefore. \"Yes, indeed, it has the air of having long been closed.\"\nAmine looked around her, and then examined the furniture. Her eyes\nwere attracted to the bird-cages; she looked into them:--\"Poor little\nthings!\" continued she, \"and here it was his father appeared unto his\nmother. Well, it may be so,--Philip saith that he hath proofs; and\nwhy should he not appear? Were Philip dead, I should rejoice to\nsee his spirit,--at least it would be something. What am I\nsaying--unfaithful lips, thus to betray my secret?--The table thrown\nover;--that looks like the work of fear; a workbox, with all its\nimplements scattered,--only a woman's fear: a mouse might have caused\nall this; and yet there is something solemn in the simple fact that,\nfor so many years, not a living being has crossed these boards. Even\nthat a table thus overthrown could thus remain for years, seems\nscarcely natural, and therefore has its power on the mind. I wonder\nnot that Philip feels there is so heavy a secret belonging to this\nroom--but it must not remain in this condition--it must be occupied at\nonce.\"\n\nAmine, who had long been accustomed to attend upon her father, and\nperform the household duties, now commenced her intended labours.\n\nEvery part of the room, and every piece of furniture in it, were\ncleaned; even the cobwebs and dust were cleared away, and the sofa\nand table brought from the corner to the centre of the room; the\nmelancholy little prisons were removed; and when Amine's work of\nneatness was complete, and the sun shone brightly into the opened\nwindow, the chamber wore the appearance of cheerfulness.\n\nAmine had the intuitive good sense to feel that strong impressions\nwear away when the objects connected with them are removed. She\nresolved then to make Philip more at ease; for, with all the fire and\nwarmth of blood inherent in her race, she had taken his image to her\nheart, and was determined to win him. Again and again did she resume\nher labour, until the pictures about the room, and every other\narticle, looked fresh and clean.\n\nNot only the bird-cages, but the workbox, and all the implements, were\nremoved; and the piece of embroidery, the taking up of which had made\nPhilip recoil, as if he had touched an adder, was put away with the\nrest. Philip had left the keys on the floor. Amine opened the buffets,\ncleaned the glazed doors, and was busy rubbing up the silver flagons\nwhen her father came into the room.\n\n\"Mercy on me!\" exclaimed Mynheer Poots; \"and is all that silver?--then\nit must be true, and he has thousands of guilders; but where are\nthey?\"\n\n\"Never do you mind, father; yours are now safe, and for that you have\nto thank Philip Vanderdecken.\"\n\n\"Yes, very true; but as he is to live here--does he eat much--what\nwill he pay me? He ought to pay well, as he has so much money.\"\n\nAmine's lips were curled with a contemptuous smile, but she made no\nreply.\n\n\"I wonder where he keeps his money; and he is going to sea as soon as\nhe can get a ship? Who will have charge of his money when he goes?\"\n\n\"I shall take charge of it, father,\" replied Amine.\n\n\"Ah--yes--well--we will take charge of it; the ship may be lost.\"\n\n\"No, _we_ will not take charge of it, father; you will have nothing to\ndo with it. Look after your own.\"\n\nAmine placed the silver in the buffets, locked the doors, and took the\nkeys with her when she went out to prepare breakfast, leaving the old\nman gazing through the glazed doors at the precious metal within. His\neyes were riveted upon it, and he could not remove them. Every minute\nhe muttered, \"Yes, all silver.\"\n\nPhilip came downstairs; and as he passed by the room, intending to go\ninto the kitchen, he perceived Mynheer Poots at the buffet, and he\nwalked into the room. He was surprised as well as pleased with the\nalteration. He felt why and by whom it was done, and he was grateful.\nAmine came in with the breakfast, and their eyes spoke more than their\nlips could have done; and Philip sat down to his meal with less of\nsorrow and gloom upon his brow.\n\n\"Mynheer Poots,\" said Philip, as soon as he had finished, \"I intend\nto leave you in possession of my cottage, and I trust you will find\nyourself comfortable. What little arrangements are necessary, I will\nconfide to your daughter previous to my departure.\"\n\n\"Then you leave us, Mr Philip, to go to sea? It must be pleasant to go\nand see strange countries--much better than staying at home. When do\nyou go?\"\n\n\"I shall leave this evening for Amsterdam,\" replied Philip, \"to make\nmy arrangements about a ship, but I shall return, I think, before I\nsail.\"\n\n\"Ah! you will return. Yes--you have your money and your goods to see\nto; you must count your money--we will take good care of it. Where is\nyour money, Mr Vanderdecken?\"\n\n\"That I will communicate to your daughter this forenoon, before I\nleave. In three weeks at the furthest you may expect me back.\"\n\n\"Father,\" said Amine, \"you promised to go and see the child of the\nburgomaster; it is time you went.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes--by-and-bye--all in good time; but I must wait the pleasure\nof Mr Philip first--he has much to tell me before he goes.\"\n\nPhilip could not help smiling when he remembered what had passed when\nhe first summoned Mynheer Poots to the cottage, but the remembrance\nended in sorrow and a clouded brow.\n\nAmine, who knew what was passing in the minds of both her father and\nPhilip, now brought her father's hat, and led him to the door of the\ncottage; and Mynheer Poots, very much against his inclination, but\nnever disputing the will of his daughter, was obliged to depart.\n\n\"So soon, Philip?\" said Amine, returning to the room.\n\n\"Yes, Amine, immediately. But I trust to be back once more before I\nsail; if not, you must now have my instructions. Give me the keys.\"\n\nPhilip opened the cupboard below the buffet, and the doors of the iron\nsafe.\n\n\"There, Amine, is my money; we need not count it, as your father would\npropose. You see that I was right when I asserted that I had thousands\nof guilders. At present they are of no use to me, as I have to learn\nmy profession. Should I return some day, they may help me to own a\nship. I know not what my destiny may be.\"\n\n\"And should you not return?\" replied Amine, gravely.\n\n\"Then they are yours--as well as all that is in this cottage, and the\ncottage itself.\"\n\n\"You have relations, have you not?\"\n\n\"But one, who is rich; an uncle, who helped us but little in our\ndistress, and who has no children. I owe him but little, and he wants\nnothing. There is but one being in this world who has created an\ninterest in this heart, Amine, and it is you. I wish you to look upon\nme as a brother--I shall always love you as a dear sister.\"\n\nAmine made no reply. Philip took some more money out of the bag which\nhad been opened, for the expenses of his journey, and then locking up\nthe safe and cupboard, gave the keys to Amine. He was about to address\nher, when there was a slight knock at the door, and in entered Father\nSeysen, the priest.\n\n\"Save you, my son; and you, my child, whom as yet I have not seen. You\nare, I suppose, the daughter of Mynheer Poots?\"\n\nAmine bowed her head.\n\n\"I perceive, Philip, that the room is now opened, and I have heard of\nall that has passed. I would now talk with thee, Philip, and must beg\nthis maiden to leave us for awhile alone.\"\n\nAmine quitted the room, and the priest, sitting down on the couch,\nbeckoned Philip to his side. The conversation which ensued was too\nlong to repeat. The priest first questioned Philip relative to his\nsecret, but on that point he could not obtain the information which he\nwished; Philip stated as much as he did to Amine, and no more. He\nalso declared his intention of going to sea, and that, should he not\nreturn, he had bequeathed his property--the extent of which he did\nnot make known--to the doctor and his daughter. The priest then made\ninquiries relative to Mynheer Poots, asking Philip whether he knew\nwhat his creed was, as he had never appeared at any church, and report\nsaid that he was an infidel. To this Philip, as usual, gave his frank\nanswer, and intimated that the daughter, at least, was anxious to\nbe enlightened, begging the priest to undertake a task to which he\nhimself was not adequate. To this request Father Seysen, who perceived\nthe state of Philip's mind with regard to Amine, readily consented.\nAfter a conversation of nearly two hours, they were interrupted by the\nreturn of Mynheer Poots, who darted out of the room the instant he\nperceived Father Seysen. Philip called Amine, and having begged her as\na favour to receive the priest's visits, the good old man blessed them\nboth and departed.\n\n\"You did not give him any money, Mr Philip?\" said Mynheer Poots, when\nFather Seysen had left the room.\n\n\"I did not,\" replied Philip; \"I wish I had thought of it.\"\n\n\"No, no--it is better not--for money is better than what he can give\nyou; but he must not come here.\"\n\n\"Why not, father,\" replied Amine, \"if Mr Philip wishes it? It is his\nown house.\"\n\n\"O yes, if Mr Philip wishes it; but you know he is going away.\"\n\n\"Well, and suppose he is--why should not the Father come here? He\nshall come here to see me.\"\n\n\"See you, my child!--what can he want with you? Well, then, if he\ncomes, I will not give him one stiver--and then he'll soon go away.\"\n\nPhilip had no opportunity of further converse with Amine; indeed he\nhad nothing more to say. In an hour he bade her farewell in presence\nof her father, who would not leave them, hoping to obtain from Philip\nsome communication about the money which he was to leave behind him.\n\nIn two days Philip arrived at Amsterdam, and having made the necessary\ninquiries, found that there was no chance of vessels sailing for the\nEast Indies for some months. The Dutch East India Company had long\nbeen formed, and all private trading was at an end. The Company's\nvessels left only at what was supposed to be the most favourable\nseason for rounding the Cape of Storms, as the Cape of Good Hope was\ndesignated by the early adventurers. One of the ships which were to\nsail with the next fleet was the _Ter Schilling_, a three-masted\nvessel, now laid up and unrigged.\n\nPhilip found out the captain, and stated his wishes to sail with him,\nto learn his profession as a seaman; the captain was pleased with his\nappearance, and as Philip not only agreed to receive no wages during\nthe voyage, but to pay a premium as an apprentice learning his duty,\nhe was promised a berth on board as the second mate, to mess in the\ncabin; and he was told that he should be informed whenever the vessel\nwas to sail. Philip having now done all that he could in obedience to\nhis vow, determined to return to the cottage; and once more he was in\nthe company of Amine.\n\nWe must now pass over two months, during which Mynheer Poots continued\nto labour at his vocation, and was seldom within doors, and our two\nyoung friends were left for hours together. Philip's love for Amine\nwas fully equal to hers for him. It was more than love--it was a\ndevotion on both sides, each day increasing. Who, indeed, could be\nmore charming, more attractive in all ways than the high-spirited, yet\ntender Amine? Occasionally the brow of Philip would be clouded when he\nreflected upon the dark prospect before him; but Amine's smile would\nchase away the gloom, and, as he gazed on her, all would be forgotten.\nAmine made no secret of her attachment; it was shown in every word,\nevery look, and every gesture. When Philip would take her hand, or\nencircle her waist with his arm, or even when he pressed her coral\nlips, there was no pretence of coyness on her part. She was too noble,\ntoo confiding; she felt that her happiness was centred in his love,\nand she lived but in his presence. Two months had thus passed away,\nwhen Father Seysen, who often called, and had paid much attention\nto Amine's instruction, one day came in as Amine was encircled in\nPhilip's arms.\n\n\"My children,\" said he, \"I have watched you for some time: this is not\nwell. Philip, if you intend marriage, as I presume you do, still it is\ndangerous. I must join your hands.\"\n\nPhilip started up.\n\n\"Surely I am not deceived in thee, my son,\" continued the priest, in a\nsevere tone.\n\n\"No, no, good Father; but I pray you leave me now: to-morrow you may\ncome, and all will be decided. But I must talk with Amine.\"\n\nThe priest quitted the room, and Amine and Philip were again alone.\nThe colour in Amine's cheek varied and her heart beat, for she felt\nhow much her happiness was at stake.\n\n\"The priest is right, Amine,\" said Philip, sitting down by her. \"This\ncannot last;--would that I could ever stay with you: how hard a fate\nis mine! You know I love the very ground you tread upon, yet I dare\nnot ask thee to wed to misery.\"\n\n\"To wed with thee would not be wedding misery, Philip,\" replied Amine,\nwith downcast eyes.\n\n\"'Twere not kindness on my part, Amine. I should indeed be selfish.\"\n\n\"I will speak plainly, Philip,\" replied Amine. \"You say you love\nme,--I know not how men love,--but this I know, how I can love. I feel\nthat to leave me now were indeed unkind and selfish on your part; for,\nPhilip, I--I should die. You say that you must go away,--that fate\ndemands it,--and your fatal secret. Be it so;--but cannot I go with\nyou?\"\n\n\"Go with me, Amine--unto death?\"\n\n\"Yes, death; for what is death but a release? I fear not death,\nPhilip; I fear but losing thee. Nay, more; is not your life in the\nhands of Him who made all? then why so sure to die? You have hinted to\nme that you are chosen--selected for a task;--if chosen, there is less\nchance of death; for until the end be fulfilled, if chosen, you must\nlive. I would I knew your secret, Philip: a woman's wit might serve\nyou well: and if it did not serve you, is there no comfort, no\npleasure, in sharing sorrow as well as joy with one you say you dote\nupon?\"\n\n\"Amine, dearest Amine; it is my love, my ardent love alone, which\nmakes me pause: for, O Amine, what pleasure should I feel if we were\nthis hour united! I hardly know what to say, or what to do. I could\nnot withhold my secret from you if you were my wife, nor will I wed\nyou till you know it. Well, Amine, I will cast my all upon the die.\nYou shall know this secret, learn what a doomed wretch I am, though\nfrom no fault of mine, and then you yourself shall decide. But\nremember, my oath is registered in heaven, and I must not be dissuaded\nfrom it; keep that in mind, and hear my tale,--then if you choose to\nwed with one whose prospects are so bitter, be it so,--a short-lived\nhappiness will then be mine, but for you, Amine--\"\n\n\"At once the secret, Philip,\" cried Amine, impatiently.\n\nPhilip then entered into a detail of what our readers are acquainted\nwith. Amine listened in silence; not a change of feature was to be\nobserved in her countenance during the narrative. Philip wound up\nwith stating the oath which he had taken. \"I have done,\" said Philip,\nmournfully.\n\n\"'Tis a strange story, Philip,\" replied Amine: \"and now hear me;--but\ngive me first that relic,--I wish to look upon it. And can there be\nsuch virtue--I had nigh said, such mischief--in this little thing?\nStrange; forgive me, Philip,--but I've still my doubts upon this tale\nof _Eblis_. You know I am not yet strong in the new belief which\nyou and the good priest have lately taught me. I do not say that it\n_cannot_ be true: but still, one so unsettled as I am may be allowed\nto waver. But, Philip, I'll assume that all is true. Then, if it be\ntrue, without the oath you would be doing but your duty; and think not\nso meanly of Amine as to suppose she would restrain you from what is\nright. No, Philip, seek your father, and, if you can, and he requires\nyour aid, then save him. But, Philip, do you imagine that a task like\nthis, so high, is to be accomplished at one trial? O! no;--if you have\nbeen so chosen to fulfil it, you will be preserved through difficulty\nand danger until you have worked out your end. You will be preserved,\nand you will again and again return;--be comforted--consoled--be\ncherished--and be loved by Amine as your wife. And when it pleases Him\nto call you from this world, your memory, if she survive you, Philip,\nwill equally be cherished in her bosom. Philip, you have given me to\ndecide;--dearest Philip, I am thine.\"\n\nAmine extended her arms, and Philip pressed her to his bosom. That\nevening Philip demanded his daughter of the father, and Mynheer Poots,\nas soon as Philip opened the iron safe and displayed the guilders,\ngave his immediate consent.\n\nFather Seysen called the next day and received his answer; and three\ndays afterwards, the bells of the little church of Terneuse were\nringing a merry peal for the union of Amine Poots and Philip\nVanderdecken.\n\n\n\n\nChapter VII\n\n\nIt was not until late in the autumn that Philip was roused from his\ndream of love (for what, alas! is every enjoyment of this life but a\ndream?) by a summons from the captain of the vessel with whom he had\nengaged to sail. Strange as it may appear, from the first day which\nput him in possession of his Amine, Philip had no longer brooded over\nhis future destiny: occasionally it was recalled to his memory, but\nimmediately rejected, and, for the time, forgotten. Sufficient he\nthought it to fulfil his engagement when the time should come; and\nalthough the hours flew away, and day succeeded day, week week, and\nmonth month, with the rapidity accompanying a life of quiet and\nunvarying bliss, Philip forgot his vow in the arms of Amine, who was\ncareful not to revert to a topic which would cloud the brow of her\nadored husband. Once, indeed, or twice, had old Poots raised the\nquestion of Philip's departure, but the indignant frown and the\nimperious command of Amine (who knew too well the sordid motives which\nactuated her father, and who, at such times, looked upon him with\nabhorrence) made him silent, and the old man would spend his leisure\nhours in walking up and down the parlour with his eyes riveted upon\nthe buffets, where the silver tankards now beamed in all their\npristine brightness.\n\nOne morning, in the month of October, there was a tapping with the\nknuckles at the cottage door. As this precaution implied a stranger,\nAmine obeyed the summons, \"I would speak with Master Philip\nVanderdecken,\" said the stranger, in a half-whispering sort of voice.\n\nThe party who thus addressed Amine was a little meagre personage,\ndressed in the garb of the Dutch seamen of the time, with a cap made\nof badger-skin hanging over his brow. His features were sharp and\ndiminutive, his face of a deadly white, his lips pale, and his hair\nof a mixture between red and white. He had very little show of\nbeard--indeed, it was almost difficult to say what his age might be.\nHe might have been a sickly youth early sinking into decrepitude, or\nan old man, hale in constitution, yet carrying no flesh. But the most\nimportant feature, and that which immediately riveted the attention of\nAmine, was the eye of this peculiar personage--for he had but one; the\nright eye-lid was closed, and the ball within had evidently wasted\naway; but his left eye was, for the size of his face and head, of\nunusual dimensions, very protuberant, clear and watery, and most\nunpleasant to look upon, being relieved by no fringe of eyelash either\nabove or below it. So remarkable was the feature, that when you looked\nat the man, you saw his eye and looked at nothing else. It was not a\nman with one eye, but one eye with a man attached to it: the body was\nbut the tower of the lighthouse, of no further value, and commanding\nno further attention, than does the structure which holds up the\nbeacon to the venturous mariner; and yet, upon examination, you would\nhave perceived that the man, although small, was neatly made; that his\nhands were very different in texture and colour from those of common\nseamen; that his features in general, although sharp, were regular;\nand that there was an air of superiority even in the obsequious manner\nof the little personage, and an indescribable something about his\nwhole appearance which almost impressed you with awe. Amine's dark\neyes were for a moment fixed upon the visitor, and she felt a chill at\nher heart for which she could not account, as she requested that he\nwould walk in.\n\nPhilip was greatly surprised at the appearance of the stranger, who,\nas soon as he entered the room, without saying a word, sat down on the\nsofa by Philip in the place which Amine had just left. To Philip there\nwas something ominous in this person taking Amine's seat; all that\nhad passed rushed into his recollection, and he felt that there was a\nsummons from his short existence of enjoyment and repose to a life of\nfuture activity, danger, and suffering. What peculiarly struck Philip\nwas, that when the little man sat beside him, a sensation of sudden\ncold ran through his whole frame. The colour fled from Philip's\ncheek, but he spoke not. For a minute or two there was a silence. The\none-eyed visitor looked round him, and turning from the buffets he\nfixed his eyes on the form of Amine, who stood before him; at last the\nsilence was broken by a sort of giggle on the part of the stranger,\nwhich ended in--\n\n\"Philip Vanderdecken--he! he!--Philip Vanderdecken, you don't know\nme?\"\n\n\"I do not,\" replied Philip, in a half-angry tone.\n\nThe voice of the little man was most peculiar--it was a sort of\nsubdued scream, the notes of which sounded in your ear long after he\nhad ceased to speak.\n\n\"I am Schriften, one of the pilots of the _Ter Schilling_,\" continued\nthe man; \"and I'm come--he! he!\"--and he looked hard at Amine--\"to\ntake you away from love\"--and looking at the buffets--\"he! he! from\ncomfort, and from this also,\" cried he, stamping his foot on the floor\nas he rose from the sofa--\"from terra firma--he! he!--to a watery\ngrave perhaps. Pleasant!\" continued Schriften, with a giggle; and with\na countenance full of meaning he fixed his one eye on Philip's face.\n\nPhilip's first impulse was to put his new visitor out of the door; but\nAmine, who read his thoughts, folded her arms as she stood before the\nlittle man, and eyed him with contempt, as she observed:--\n\n\"We all must meet our fate, good fellow; and, whether by land or sea,\ndeath will have his due. If death stare him in the face, the cheek of\nPhilip Vanderdecken will never turn as white as yours is now.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" replied Schriften, evidently annoyed at this cool\ndetermination on the part of one so young and beautiful; and\nthen fixing his eye upon the silver shrine of the Virgin on the\nmantel-piece--\"You are a Catholic, I perceive--he!\"\n\n\"I am a Catholic,\" replied Philip; \"but does that concern you? When\ndoes the vessel sail?\"\n\n\"In a week--he! he!--only a week for preparation--only seven days to\nleave all--short notice!\"\n\n\"More than sufficient,\" replied Philip, rising up from the sofa. \"You\nmay tell your captain that I shall not fail. Come, Amine, we must lose\nno time.\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" replied Amine, \"and our first duty is hospitality:\nMynheer, may we offer you refreshment after your walk?\"\n\n\"This day week,\" said Schriften, addressing Philip, and without making\na reply to Amine. Philip nodded his head, the little man turned on his\nheel and left the room, and in a short time was out of sight.\n\nAmine sank down on the sofa. The breaking-up of her short hour of\nhappiness had been too sudden, too abrupt, and too cruelly brought\nabout for a fondly doting, although heroic, woman. There was an\nevident malignity in the words and manner of the one-eyed messenger,\nan appearance as if he knew more than others, which awed and confused\nboth Philip and herself. Amine wept not, but she covered her face with\nher hands as Philip, with no steady pace, walked up and down the small\nroom. Again, with all the vividness of colouring, did the scenes\nhalf forgotten recur to his memory. Again did he penetrate the fatal\nchamber--again was it obscure. The embroidery lay at his feet, and\nonce more he started as when the letter appeared upon the floor.\n\nThey had both awakened from a dream of present bliss, and shuddered at\nthe awful future which presented itself. A few minutes were sufficient\nfor Philip to resume his natural self-possession. He sat down by the\nside of his Amine, and clasped her in his arms. They remained silent.\nThey knew too well each other's thoughts; and, excruciating as was\nthe effort, they were both summoning up their courage to bear, and\nsteeling their hearts against the conviction that, in this world, they\nmust now expect to be for a time, perhaps for ever, separated.\n\nAmine was the first to speak: removing her arms, which had been wound\nround her husband, she first put his hand to her heart, as if to\ncompress its painful throbbings, and then observed--\n\n\"Surely that was no earthly messenger, Philip! Did you not feel\nchilled to death when he sat by you? I did, as he came in.\"\n\nPhilip, who had the same thought as Amine, but did not wish to alarm\nher, answered confusedly--\n\n\"Nay, Amine, you fancy--that is, the suddenness of his appearance and\nhis strange conduct have made you imagine this; but I saw in him but a\nman who, from his peculiar deformity, has become an envious outcast\nof society--debarred from domestic happiness, from the smiles of the\nother sex; for what woman could smile upon such a creature? His\nbile raised at so much beauty in the arms of another, he enjoyed a\nmalignant pleasure in giving a message which he felt would break upon\nthose pleasures from which he is cut off. Be assured, my love, that it\nwas nothing more.\"\n\n\"And even if my conjecture were correct, what does it matter?\" replied\nAmine. \"There can be nothing more--nothing which can render your\nposition more awful and more desperate. As your wife, Philip, I feel\nless courage than I did when I gave my willing hand. I knew not then\nwhat would be the extent of my loss; but fear not, much as I feel\nhere,\" continued Amine, putting her hand to her heart--\"I am prepared,\nand proud that he who is selected for such a task is my husband.\"\nAmine paused. \"You cannot surely have been mistaken, Philip?\"\n\n\"No! Amine, I have not been mistaken, either in the summons or in\nmy own courage, or in my selection of a wife,\" replied Philip,\nmournfully, as he embraced her. \"It is the will of Heaven.\"\n\n\"Then may its will be done,\" replied Amine, rising from her seat. \"The\nfirst pang is over. I feel better now, Philip. Your Amine knows her\nduty.\"\n\nPhilip made no reply; when, after a few moments, Amine continued:\n\n\"But one short week, Philip--\"\n\n\"I would it had been but one day;\" replied he; \"it would have been\nlong enough. He has come too soon--the one-eyed monster.\"\n\n\"Nay, not so, Philip. I thank him for the week--'tis but a short time\nto wean myself from happiness. I grant you, that were I to tease, to\nvex, to unman you with my tears, my prayers, or my upbraidings (as\nsome wives would do, Philip), one day would be more than sufficient\nfor such a scene of weakness on my part, and misery on yours. But, no,\nPhilip, your Amine knows her duty better. You must go like some knight\nof old to perilous encounter, perhaps to death; but Amine will arm\nyou, and show her love by closing carefully each rivet to protect you\nin your peril, and will see you depart full of hope and confidence,\nanticipating your return. A week is not too long, Philip, when\nemployed as I trust I shall employ it--a week to interchange our\nsentiments, to hear your voice, to listen to your words (each of which\nwill be engraven on my heart's memory), to ponder on them, and feed my\nlove with them in your absence and in my solitude. No! no! Philip; I\nthank God that there is yet a week.\"\n\n\"And so do I, then, Amine; and, after all, we knew that this must\ncome.\"\n\n\"Yes! but my love was so potent, that it banished memory.\"\n\n\"And yet during our separation your love must feed on memory, Amine.\"\n\nAmine sighed. Here their conversation was interrupted by the entrance\nof Mynheer Poots, who, struck with the alteration in Amine's radiant\nfeatures, exclaimed, \"Holy Prophet! what is the matter now?\"\n\n\"Nothing more than what we all knew before,\" replied Philip; \"I am\nabout to leave you--the ship will sail in a week.\"\n\n\"Oh! you will sail in a week?\"\n\nThere was a curious expression in the face of the old man as he\nendeavoured to suppress, before Amine and her husband, the joy which\nhe felt at Philip's departure. Gradually he subdued his features into\ngravity, and said--\n\n\"That is very bad news, indeed.\"\n\nNo answer was made by Amine or Philip, who quitted the room together.\n\nWe must pass over this week, which was occupied in preparations for\nPhilip's departure. We must pass over the heroism of Amine, who\ncontrolled her feelings, racked as she was with intense agony at the\nidea of separating from her adored husband. We cannot dwell upon the\nconflicting emotions in the breast of Philip, who left competence,\nhappiness, and love, to encounter danger, privation, and death. Now,\nat one time, he would almost resolve to remain, and then at others,\nas he took the relic from his bosom and remembered his vow registered\nupon it, he was nearly as anxious to depart. Amine, too, as she fell\nasleep in her husband's arms, would count the few hours left them;\nor she would shudder, as she lay awake and the wind howled, at the\nprospect of what Philip would have to encounter. It was a long week to\nboth of them, and, although they thought that time flew fast, it was\nalmost a relief when the morning came that was to separate them; for\nto their feelings, which, from regard to each other, had been pent up\nand controlled, they could then give vent; their surcharged bosoms\ncould be relieved; certainty had driven away suspense, and hope was\nstill left to cheer them and brighten up the dark horizon of the\nfuture.\n\n\"Philip,\" said Amine, as they sat together with their hands entwined,\n\"I shall not feel so much when you are gone. I do not forget that all\nthis was told me before we were wed, and that for my love I took the\nhazard. My fond heart often tells me that you will return; but it may\ndeceive me--return you _may_, but not in life. In this room I shall\nawait you; on this sofa, removed to its former station, I shall sit;\nand if you cannot appear to me alive, O refuse me not, if it be\npossible, to appear to me when dead. I shall fear no storm, no\nbursting open of the window. O no! I shall hail the presence even of\nyour spirit. Once more; let me but see you--let me be assured that you\nare dead--and then I shall know that I have no more to live for in\nthis world, and shall hasten to join you in a world of bliss. Promise\nme, Philip.\"\n\n\"I promise all you ask, provided Heaven will so permit; but, Amine,\"\nand Philip's lips trembled, \"I cannot--merciful God! I am indeed\ntried. Amine, I can stay no longer.\"\n\nAmine's dark eyes were fixed upon her husband--she could not\nspeak--her features were convulsed--nature could no longer hold\nup against her excess of feeling--she fell into his arms, and lay\nmotionless. Philip, about to impress a last kiss upon her pale lips,\nperceived that she had fainted.\n\n\"She feels not now,\" said he, as he laid her upon the sofa; \"it is\nbetter that it should be so--too soon will she awake to misery.\"\n\nSummoning to the assistance of his daughter Mynheer Poots, who was\nin the adjoining room, Philip caught up his hat, imprinted one more\nfervent kiss upon her forehead, burst from the house, and was out of\nsight long before Amine had recovered from her swoon.\n\n\n\n\nChapter VIII\n\n\nBefore we follow Philip Vanderdecken in his venturous career, it\nwill be necessary to refresh the memory of our readers by a succinct\nrecapitulation of the circumstances that had directed the enterprise\nof the Dutch towards the country of the East, which was now proving to\nthem a source of wealth which they considered as inexhaustible.\n\nLet us begin at the beginning. Charles the Fifth, after having\npossessed the major part of Europe, retired from the world, for\nreasons best known to himself, and divided his kingdoms between\nFerdinand and Philip. To Ferdinand he gave Austria and its\ndependencies; to Philip Spain; but to make the division more equal\nand palatable to the latter, he threw the Low Countries, with the few\nmillions vegetating upon them, into the bargain. Having thus disposed\nof his fellow-mortals much to his own satisfaction, he went into a\nconvent, reserving for himself a small income, twelve men, and a pony.\nWhether he afterwards repented his hobby, or mounted his pony, is not\nrecorded; but this is certain--that in two years he died.\n\nPhilip thought (as many have thought before and since) that he had a\nright to do what he pleased with his own. He therefore took away from\nthe Hollanders most of their liberties: to make amends, however, he\ngave them the Inquisition; but the Dutch grumbled, and Philip, to stop\ntheir grumbling, burnt a few of them. Upon which, the Dutch, who are\naquatic in their propensities, protested against a religion which was\nmuch too warm for their constitutions. In short, heresy made great\nprogress; and the Duke of Alva was despatched with a large army, to\nprove to the Hollanders that the Inquisition was the very best of all\npossible arrangements, and that it was infinitely better that a man\nshould be burnt for half-an-hour in this world than for eternity in\nthe next.\n\nThis slight difference of opinion was the occasion of a war, which\nlasted about eight years, and which, after having saved some hundreds\nof thousands the trouble of dying in their beds, at length ended in\nthe Seven United Provinces being declared independent. Now we must go\nback again.\n\nFor a century after Vasco de Gama had discovered the passage round the\nCape of Good Hope, the Portuguese were not interfered with by other\nnations. At last the adventurous spirit of the English nation was\nroused. The passage to India by the Cape had been claimed by the\nPortuguese as their sole right, and they defended it by force. For a\nlong time no private company ventured to oppose them, and the trade\nwas not of that apparent value to induce any government to embark in\na war upon the question. The English adventurers, therefore, turned\ntheir attention to the discovery of a north-west passage to India,\nwith which the Portuguese could have no right to interfere, and in\nvain attempts to discover that passage, the best part of the fifteenth\ncentury was employed. At last they abandoned their endeavours, and\nresolved no longer to be deterred by the Portuguese pretensions.\n\nAfter one or two unsuccessful expeditions, an armament was fitted out\nand put under the orders of Drake. This courageous and successful\nnavigator accomplished more than the most sanguine had anticipated. He\nreturned to England in the month of May, 1580, after a voyage which\noccupied him nearly three years; bringing home with him great riches,\nand having made most favourable arrangements with the king of the\nMolucca Islands.\n\nHis success was followed up by Cavendish and others in 1600. The\nEnglish East India Company, in the meanwhile, received their first\ncharter from the government, and had now been with various success\ncarrying on the trade for upwards of fifty years.\n\nDuring the time that the Dutch were vassals to the crown of Spain, it\nwas their custom to repair to Lisbon for the productions of the East,\nand afterwards to distribute them through Europe; but when they\nquarrelled with Philip, they were no longer admitted as retailers of\nhis Indian produce: the consequence was, that, while asserting, and\nfighting for, their independence, they had also fitted out expeditions\nto India. They were successful; and in 1602 the various speculators\nwere, by the government, formed into a company, upon the same\nprinciples and arrangement as those which had been chartered in\nEngland.\n\nAt the time, therefore, to which we are reverting, the English and\nDutch had been trading in the Indian seas for more than fifty years;\nand the Portuguese had lost nearly all their power, from the alliances\nand friendships which their rivals had formed with the potentates of\nthe East, who had suffered from the Portuguese avarice and cruelty.\n\nWhatever may have been the sum of obligation which the Dutch owed to\nthe English for the assistance they received from them during their\nstruggle for independence, it does not appear that their gratitude\nextended beyond the Cape; for, on the other side of it, the\nPortuguese, English, and Dutch fought and captured each other's\nvessels without ceremony; and there was no law but that of main force.\nThe mother countries were occasionally called upon to interfere, but\nthe interference up to the above time had produced nothing more than a\npaper war; it being very evident that all parties were in the wrong.\n\nIn 1650, Cromwell usurped the throne of England, and the year\nafterwards, having, among other points, vainly demanded of the Dutch\nsatisfaction for the murder of his regicide ambassador, which took\nplace in this year, and some compensation for the cruelties exercised\non the English at Amboyne some thirty years before he declared war\nwith Holland. To prove that he was in earnest, he seized more than two\nhundred Dutch vessels, and the Dutch then (very unwillingly) prepared\nfor war. Blake and Van Tromp met, and the naval combats were most\nobstinate. In the \"History of England\" the victory is almost\ninvariably given to the English, but in that of Holland to the Dutch.\nBy all accounts, these engagements were so obstinate, that in each\ncase they were both well beaten. However, in 1654, peace was signed;\nthe Dutchman promising \"to take his hat off\" whenever he should meet\nan Englishman on the high seas--a mere act of politeness which Mynheer\ndid not object to, as it _cost nothing_. And now, having detailed\nthe state of things up to the time of Philip's embarkation, we shall\nproceed with our story.\n\nAs soon as Philip was clear of his own threshold, he hastened away as\nthough he were attempting to escape from his own painful thoughts.\nIn two days he arrived at Amsterdam, where his first object was to\nprocure a small, but strong, steel chain to replace the ribbon by\nwhich the relic had hitherto been secured round his neck. Having done\nthis, he hastened to embark with his effects on board of the _Ter\nSchilling_. Philip had not forgotten to bring with him the money which\nhe had agreed to pay the captain, in consideration of being received\non board as an apprentice rather than a sailor. He had also furnished\nhimself with a further sum for his own exigencies. It was late in the\nevening when he arrived on board of the _Ter Schilling_, which lay at\nsingle anchor, surrounded by the other vessels composing the Indian\nfleet. The captain, whose name was Kloots, received him with kindness,\nshowed him his berth, and then went below in the hold to decide a\nquestion relative to the cargo, leaving Philip on deck to his own\nreflections.\n\nAnd this, then, thought Philip, as he leaned against the taffrail and\nlooked forward--this, then, is the vessel in which my first attempt is\nto be made. First and--perhaps, last. How little do those with whom I\nam about to sail imagine the purport of my embarkation? How different\nare my views from those of others? Do _I_ seek a fortune? No! Is it to\nsatisfy curiosity and a truant spirit? No! I seek communion with the\ndead. Can I meet the dead without danger to myself and those who sail\nwith me? I should think not, for I cannot join it but in death. Did\nthey surmise my wishes and intentions, would they permit me to remain\none hour on board? Superstitious as seamen are said to be, they might\nfind a good excuse, if they knew my mission, not only for their\nsuperstition, but for ridding themselves of one on such an awful\nerrand. Awful indeed! and how to be accomplished? Heaven alone, with\nperseverance on my part, can solve the mystery. And Philip's\nthoughts reverted to his Amine. He folded his arms and, entranced in\nmeditation, with his eyes raised to the firmament, he appeared to\nwatch the flying scud.\n\n\"Had you not better go below?\" said a mild voice, which made Philip\nstart from his reverie.\n\nIt was that of the first mate, whose name was Hillebrant, a short,\nwell-set man of about thirty years of age. His hair was flaxen, and\nfell in long flakes upon his shoulders, his complexion fair, and his\neyes of a soft blue; although there was little of the sailor in his\nappearance, few knew or did their duty better.\n\n\"I thank you,\" replied Philip; \"I had, indeed, forgotten myself, and\nwhere I was: my thoughts were far away. Good-night, and many thanks.\"\n\nThe _Ter Schilling_, like most of the vessels of that period, was very\ndifferent in her build and fitting from those of the present day. She\nwas ship-rigged, and of about four hundred tons burden. Her bottom was\nnearly flat, and her sides fell in (as she rose above the water), so\nthat her upper decks were not half the width of the hold.\n\nAll the vessels employed by the Company being armed, she had her main\ndeck clear of goods, and carried six nine-pounders on each broadside;\nher ports were small and oval. There was a great spring in all her\ndecks,--that is to say, she ran with a curve forward and aft. On her\nforecastle another small deck ran from the knight-heads, which was\ncalled the top-gallant forecastle. Her quarter-deck was broken with a\npoop, which rose high out of the water. The bowsprit staved very much,\nand was to appearance almost as a fourth mast: the more so, as she\ncarried a square spritsail and sprit-topsail. On her quarter-deck and\npoop-bulwarks were fixed in sockets implements of warfare now long\nin disuse, but what were then known by the names of cohorns and\npatteraroes; they turned round on a swivel, and were pointed by\nan iron handle fixed to the breech. The sail abaft the mizen-mast\n(corresponding to the driver or spanker of the present day) was\nfixed upon a lateen-yard. It is hardly necessary to add (after this\ndescription) that the dangers of a long voyage were not a little\nincreased by the peculiar structure of the vessels, which (although\nwith such top hamper, and so much wood above water, they could make\ngood way before a favourable breeze) could hold no wind, and had but\nlittle chance if caught upon a lee-shore.\n\nThe crew of the _Ter Schilling_ were composed of the captain, two\nmates, two pilots, and forty-five men. The supercargo had not yet\ncome on board. The cabin (under the poop) was appropriated to the\nsupercargo; but the main-deck cabin to the captain and mates, who\ncomposed the whole of the cabin mess.\n\nWhen Philip awoke the next morning he found that the topsails were\nhoisted, and the anchor short-stay apeak. Some of the other vessels of\nthe fleet were under weigh and standing out. The weather was fine\nand the water smooth, and the bustle and novelty of the scene were\ncheering to his spirits. The captain, Mynheer Kloots, was standing\non the poop with a small telescope, made of pasteboard, to his eye,\nanxiously looking towards the town. Mynheer Kloots, as usual, had his\npipe in his mouth, and the smoke which he puffed from it for a time\nobscured the lenses of his telescope. Philip went up the poop ladder\nand saluted him.\n\nMynheer Kloots was a person of no moderate dimensions, and the\nquantity of garments which he wore added no little to his apparent\nbulk. The outer garments exposed to view were, a rough fox-skin cap\nupon his head, from under which appeared the edge of a red worsted\nnightcap; a red plush waistcoat, with large metal buttons; a jacket of\ngreen cloth, over which he wore another of larger dimensions of coarse\nblue cloth, which came down as low as what would be called a spencer.\nBelow he had black plush breeches, light blue worsted stockings,\nshoes, and broad silver buckles; round his waist was girded, with a\nbroad belt, a canvas apron which descended in thick folds nearly to\nhis knee. In his belt was a large broad-bladed knife in a sheath of\nshark's skin. Such was the attire of Mynheer Kloots, captain of the\n_Ter Schilling_.\n\nHe was as tall as he was corpulent. His face was oval, and his\nfeatures small in proportion to the size of his frame. His grizzly\nhair fluttered in the breeze, and his nose (although quite straight)\nwas, at the tip, fiery red from frequent application to his bottle of\nschnapps, and the heat of a small pipe which seldom left his lips,\nexcept for _him_ to give an order, or for _it_ to be replenished.\n\n\"Good morning, my son,\" said the captain, taking his pipe out of his\nmouth for a moment. \"We are detained by the supercargo, who appears\nnot over-willing to come on board; the boat has been on shore this\nhour waiting for him, and we shall be last of the fleet under weigh. I\nwish the Company would let us sail without these _gentlemen_, who\nare (_in my opinion)_ a great hindrance to business; but they think\notherwise on shore.\"\n\n\"What is their duty on board?\" replied Philip.\n\n\"Their duty is to look after the cargo and the traffic, and if\nthey kept to that, it would not be so bad; but they interfere with\neverything else and everybody, studying little except their own\ncomforts; in fact, they play the king on board, knowing that we dare\nnot affront them, as a word from them would prejudice the vessel when\nagain to be chartered. The Company insist upon their being received\nwith all honours. We salute them with five guns on their arrival on\nboard.\"\n\n\"Do you know anything of this one whom you expect?\"\n\n\"Nothing, but from report. A brother captain of mine (with whom he has\nsailed) told me that he is most fearful of the dangers of the sea, and\nmuch taken up with his own importance.\"\n\n\"I wish he would come,\" replied Philip; \"I am most anxious that we\nshould sail.\"\n\n\"You must be of a wandering disposition, my son: I hear that you leave\na comfortable home, and a pretty wife to boot.\"\n\n\"I am most anxious to see the world,\" replied Philip; \"and I must\nlearn to sail a ship before I purchase one, and try to make the\nfortune that I covet.\" (Alas! how different from my real wishes,\nthought Philip, as he made this reply.)\n\n\"Fortunes are made, and fortunes are swallowed up too, by the ocean,\"\nreplied the captain. \"If I could turn this good ship into a good\nhouse, with plenty of guilders to keep the house warm, you would not\nfind me standing on this poop. I have doubled the Cape twice, which is\noften enough for any man; the third time may not be so lucky.\"\n\n\"Is it so dangerous, then?\" said Philip.\n\n\"As dangerous as tides and currents, rocks and sand-banks, hard gales\nand heavy seas, can make it,--no more! Even when you anchor in the\nbay, on this side of the Cape, you ride in fear and trembling, for you\nmay be blown away from your anchor to sea, or be driven on shore among\nthe savages, before the men can well put on their clothing. But when\nonce you're well on the other side of the Cape, then the water dances\nto the beams of the sun as if it were merry, and you may sail for\nweeks with a cloudless sky and a flowing breeze, without starting tack\nor sheet, or having to take your pipe out of your mouth.\"\n\n\"What port shall we go into, Mynheer?\"\n\n\"Of that I can say but little. Gambroon, in the Gulf of Persia, will\nprobably be the first rendezvous of the whole fleet. Then we shall\nseparate: some will sail direct for Bantam, in the island of Java;\nothers will have orders to trade down the Straits for camphor, gum,\nbenzoin, and wax; they have also gold and the teeth of the elephant to\nbarter with us: there (should we be sent thither) you must be\ncareful with the natives, Mynheer Vanderdecken. They are fierce and\ntreacherous, and their curved knives (or creeses, as they, call them)\nare sharp and deadly poisoned. I have had hard fighting in those\nStraits both with Portuguese and English.\"\n\n\"But we are all at peace now.\"\n\n\"True, my son; but when round the Cape, we must not trust to papers\nsigned at home: and the English press us hard, and tread upon our\nheels wherever we go. They must be checked; and I suspect our fleet is\nso large and well appointed in expectation of hostilities.\"\n\n\"How long do you expect your voyage may occupy us?\"\n\n\"That's as may be: but I should say about two years;--nay, if not\ndetained by the factors, as I expect we shall be, for some hostile\nservice, it may be less.\"\n\nTwo years, thought Philip, two years from Amine! and he sighed deeply,\nfor he felt that their separation might be for ever.\n\n\"Nay, my son, two years is not so long,\" said Mynheer Kloots, who\nobserved the passing cloud on Philip's brow. \"I was once five years\naway, and was unfortunate, for I brought home nothing, not even my\nship. I was sent to Chittagong, on the east side of the great Bay of\nBengala, and lay for three months in the river. The chiefs of the\ncountry would detain me by force; they would not barter for my cargo,\nor permit me to seek another market. My powder had been landed, and\nI could make no resistance. The worms ate through the bottom of my\nvessel, and she sank at her anchors. They knew it would take place,\nand that then they would have my cargo at their own price. Another\nvessel brought us home. Had I not been so treacherously served, I\nshould have had no need to sail this time; and now my gains are small,\nthe Company forbidding all private trading. But here he comes at last;\nthey have hoisted the ensign on the staff in the boat; there--they\nhave shoved off. Mynheer Hillebrant, see the gunners ready with their\nlinstocks to salvo the supercargo.\"\n\n\"What duty do you wish me to perform?\" observed Philip. \"In what can I\nbe useful?\"\n\n\"At present you can be of little use, except in those heavy gales in\nwhich every pair of hands is valuable. You must look and learn for\nsome time yet; but you can make a fair copy of the journal kept for\nthe inspection of the Company, and may assist me in various ways, as\nsoon as the unpleasant nausea, felt by those who first embark, has\nsubsided. As a remedy, I should propose that you gird a handkerchief\ntight round your body so as to compress the stomach, and make frequent\napplication of my bottle of schnapps, which you will find always at\nyour service. But now to receive the factor of the most puissant\nCompany. Mynheer Hillebrant, let them discharge the cannon.\"\n\nThe guns were fired, and soon after the smoke had cleared away,\nthe boat, with its long ensign trailing on the water, was pulled\nalongside. Philip watched the appearance of the supercargo, but he\nremained in the boat until several of the boxes with the initials\nand arms of the Company were first handed on the deck; at last the\nsupercargo appeared.\n\nHe was a small, spare, wizen-faced man, with a three-cornered cocked\nhat, bound with broad gold lace, upon his head, under which appeared a\nfull-bottomed flowing wig, the curls of which descended low upon his\nshoulders. His coat was of crimson velvet, with broad flaps: his\nwaistcoat of white silk, worked in coloured flowers, and descending\nhalf-way down to his knees. His breeches were of black satin, and his\nlegs were covered with white silk stockings. Add to this, gold buckles\nat his knees and in his shoes, lace ruffles to his wrists, and a\nsilver-mounted cane in his hand, and the reader has the entire dress\nof Mynheer Jacob Janz Von Stroom, the supercargo of the Hon. Company,\nappointed to the good ship _Ter Schilling_.\n\nAs he looked round him, surrounded at a respectful distance by the\ncaptain, officers, and men of the ship, with their caps in their\nhands, the reader might be reminded of the picture of the \"Monkey who\nhad seen the World\" surrounded by his tribe. There was not, however,\nthe least inclination on the part of the seamen to laugh, even at his\nflowing, full-bottomed wig: respect was at that period paid to dress;\nand although Mynheer Von Stroom could not be mistaken for a sailor, he\nwas known to be the supercargo of the Company, and a very great man.\nHe therefore received all the respect due to so important a personage.\n\nMynheer Von Stroom did not, however, appear very anxious to remain\non deck. He requested to be shown into his cabin, and followed the\ncaptain aft, picking his way among the coils of ropes with which\nhis path was encumbered. The door was opened, and the supercargo\ndisappeared. The ship was then got under weigh, the men had left the\nwindlass, the sails had been trimmed, and they were securing the\nanchor on board, when the bell of the poop-cabin (appropriated to the\nsupercargo) was pulled with great violence.\n\n\"What can that be?\" said Mynheer Kloots (who was forward), taking the\npipe out of his mouth. \"Mynheer Vanderdecken, will you see what is the\nmatter?\"\n\nPhilip went aft, as the pealing of the bell continued, and opening\nthe cabin door, discovered the supercargo perched upon the table and\npulling the bell-rope, which hung over its centre, with every mark of\nfear in his countenance. His wig was off, and his bare skull gave him\nan appearance peculiarly ridiculous.\n\n\"What is the matter, sir?\" inquired Philip.\n\n\"Matter!\" spluttered Mynheer Von Stroom; \"call the troops in with\ntheir firelocks. Quick, sir. Am I to be murdered, torn to pieces, and\ndevoured? For mercy's sake, sir, don't stare, but do something--look,\nit's coming to the table! O dear! O dear!\" continued the supercargo,\nevidently terrified out of his wits.\n\nPhilip, whose eyes had been fixed on Mynheer Von Stroom, turned them\nin the direction pointed out, and, much to his astonishment perceived\na small bear upon the deck who was amusing himself with the\nsupercargo's flowing wig, which he held in his paws, tossing it about,\nand now and then burying his muzzle in it. The unexpected sight of the\nanimal was at first a shock to Philip, but a moment's consideration\nassured him that the animal must be harmless, or it never would have\nbeen permitted to remain loose in the vessel.\n\nNevertheless, Philip had no wish to approach the animal, whose\ndisposition he was unacquainted with, when the appearance of Mynheer\nKloots put an end to his difficulty.\n\n\"What is the matter, Mynheer?\" said the captain. \"O! I see: it is\nJohannes,\" continued the captain, going up to the bear, and saluting\nhim with a kick, as he recovered the supercargo's wig. \"Out of the\ncabin, Johannes! Out, sir!\" cried Mynheer Kloots, kicking the breech\nof the bear till the animal had escaped through the door. \"Mynheer\nVon Stroom, I am very sorry--here is your wig. Shut the door, Mynheer\nVanderdecken, or the beast may come back, for he is very fond of me.\"\n\nAs the door was shut between Mynheer Von Stroom and the object of his\nterror, the little man slid off the table to the high-backed chair\nnear it, shook out the damaged curls of his wig, and replaced it on\nhis head; pulled out his ruffles, and, assuming an air of magisterial\nimportance, struck his cane on the deck, and then spoke.\n\n\"Mynheer Kloots, what is the meaning of this disrespect to the\nsupercargo of the puissant Company?\"\n\n\"God in Heaven! no disrespect, Mynheer;--the animal is a bear, as you\nsee; he is very tame, even with strangers. He belongs to me. I have\nhad him since he was three months old. It was all a mistake. The mate,\nMynheer Hillebrant, put him in the cabin, that he might be out of the\nway while the duty was carrying on, and he quite forgot that he was\nhere. I am very sorry, Mynheer Von Stroom; but he will not come here\nagain, unless you wish to play with him.\"\n\n\"Play with him! I! supercargo to the Company, play with a bear!\nMynheer Kloots, the animal must be thrown overboard immediately.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay; I cannot throw overboard an animal that I hold in much\naffection, Mynheer Von Stroom; but he shall not trouble you.\"\n\n\"Then, Captain Kloots, you will have to deal with the Company, to whom\nI shall represent the affair. Your charter will be cancelled, and your\nfreight-money will be forfeited.\"\n\nKloots was, like most Dutchmen, not a little obstinate, and this\nimperative behaviour on the part of the supercargo raised his bile.\n\"There is nothing in the charter that prevents my having an animal on\nboard,\" replied Kloots.\n\n\"By the regulations of the Company,\" replied Von Stroom, falling back\nin his chair with an important air, and crossing his thin legs, \"you\nare required to receive on board strange and curious animals,\nsent home by the governors and factors to be presented to crowned\nheads,--such as lions, tigers, elephants, and other productions of\nthe East;--but in no instance is it permitted to the commanders of\nchartered ships to receive on board, on their own account, animals of\nany description, which must be considered under the offence of private\ntrading.\"\n\n\"My bear is not for sale, Mynheer Von Stroom.\"\n\n\"It must immediately be sent out of the ship, Mynheer Kloots; I order\nyou to send it away,--on your peril to refuse.\"\n\n\"Then we will drop the anchor again, Mynheer Von Stroom, and send on\nshore to head-quarters to decide the point. If the Company insists\nthat the brute be put on shore, be it so; but recollect, Mynheer Von\nStroom, we shall lose the protection of the fleet, and have to sail\nalone. Shall I drop the anchor, Mynheer?\"\n\nThis observation softened down the pertinacity of the supercargo; he\nhad no wish to sail alone, and the fear of this contingency was more\npowerful than the fear of the bear.\n\n\"Mynheer Kloots, I will not be too severe; if the animal is chained,\nso that it does not approach me, I will consent to its remaining on\nboard.\"\n\n\"I will keep it out of your way as much as I can; but as for chaining\nup the poor animal, it will howl all day and night, and you will have\nno sleep, Mynheer Von Stroom,\" replied Kloots.\n\nThe supercargo, who perceived that the captain was positive, and that\nhis threats were disregarded, did all that a man could do who could\nnot help himself. He vowed vengeance in his own mind, and then, with\nan air of condescension, observed: \"Upon those conditions, Mynheer\nKloots, your animal may remain on board.\"\n\nMynheer Kloots and Philip then left the cabin; the former, who was in\nno very good humour, muttering as he walked away--\"If the Company send\ntheir _monkeys_ on board, I think I may well have my _bear_\" And,\npleased with his joke, Mynheer Kloots recovered his good humour.\n\n\n\n\nChapter IX\n\n\nWe must allow the Indian fleet to pursue its way to the Cape with\nevery variety of wind and weather. Some had parted company; but\nthe rendezvous was Table Bay, from which they were again to start\ntogether.\n\nPhilip Vanderdecken was soon able to render some service on board.\nHe studied his duty diligently, for employment prevented him from\ndwelling too much upon the cause of his embarkation, and he worked\nhard at the duties of the ship, for the exercise procured for him that\nsleep which otherwise would have been denied.\n\nHe was soon a favourite of the captain, and intimate with Hillebrant,\nthe first mate; the second mate, Struys, was a morose young man, with\nwhom he had little intercourse. As for the supercargo, Mynheer Jacob\nJanz Von Stroom, he seldom ventured out of his cabin. The bear\nJohannes was not confined, and therefore Mynheer Von Stroom confined\nhimself; hardly a day passed that he did not look over a letter which\nhe had framed upon the subject, all ready to forward to the Company;\nand each time that he perused it he made some alteration, which he\nconsidered would give additional force to his complaint, and would\nprove still more injurious to the interests of Captain Kloots.\n\nIn the meantime, in happy ignorance of all that was passing in the\npoop-cabin, Mynheer Kloots smoked his pipe, drank his schnapps, and\nplayed with Johannes. The animal had also contracted a great affection\nfor Philip, and used to walk the watch with him.\n\nThere was another party in the ship whom we must not lose sight\nof--the one-eyed pilot, Schriften, who appeared to have imbibed a\ngreat animosity towards our hero, as well as to his dumb favourite\nthe bear. As Philip held the rank of an officer, Schriften dared not\nopenly affront, though he took every opportunity of annoying him, and\nwas constantly inveighing against him before the ship's company. To\nthe bear he was more openly inveterate, and seldom passed it without\nbestowing upon it a severe kick, accompanied with a horrid curse.\nAlthough no one on board appeared to be fond of this man, everybody\nappeared to be afraid of him, and he had obtained a control over the\nseamen which appeared unaccountable.\n\nSuch was the state of affairs on board the good ship _Ter Schilling_,\nwhen, in company with two others, she lay becalmed about two days'\nsail to the Cape. The weather was intensely hot, for it was the summer\nin those southern latitudes, and Philip, who had been lying down under\nthe awning spread over the poop, was so overcome with the heat that he\nhad fallen asleep. He awoke with a shivering sensation of cold over\nhis whole body, particularly at his chest, and half-opening his eyes,\nhe perceived the pilot, Schriften, leaning over him, and holding\nbetween his finger and his thumb a portion of the chain which had not\nbeen concealed, and to which was attached the sacred relic. Philip\nclosed them again, to ascertain what were the man's intentions: he\nfound that he gradually dragged out the chain, and, when the relic was\nclear, attempted to pass the whole over his head, evidently to gain\npossession of it. Upon his attempt Philip started up and seized him by\nthe waist.\n\n\"Indeed!\" cried Philip, with an indignant look, as he released the\nchain from the pilot's hand.\n\nBut Schriften appeared not in the least confused at being detected\nin his attempt: looking with his malicious one eye at Philip, he\nmockingly observed:\n\n\"Does that chain hold her picture?--he! he!\"\n\nVanderdecken rose, pushed him away, and folded his arms.\n\n\"I advise you not to be quite so curious, Master Pilot, or you may\nrepent it.\"\n\n\"Or perhaps,\" continued the pilot, quite regardless of Philip's wrath,\n\"it may be a child's caul, a sovereign remedy against drowning.\"\n\n\"Go forward to your duty, sir,\" cried Philip.\n\n\"Or, as you are a Catholic, the finger-nail of a saint; or, yes, I\nhave it--a piece of the holy cross.\"\n\nPhilip started.\n\n\"That's it! that's it!\" cried Schriften, who now went forward to where\nthe seamen were standing at the gangway. \"News for you, my lads!\" said\nhe; \"we've a bit of the holy cross aboard, and so we may defy the\ndevil!\"\n\nPhilip, hardly knowing why, had followed Schriften as he descended the\npoop-ladder, and was forward on the quarter-deck, when the pilot made\nthis remark to the seamen.\n\n\"Ay! ay!\" replied an old seaman to the pilot; \"not only the devil, but\nthe _Flying Dutchman_ to boot.\"\n\n\"The _Flying Dutchman_\" thought Philip, \"can that refer to--?\" and\nPhilip walked a step or two forward, so as to conceal himself behind\nthe mainmast, hoping to obtain some information, should they continue\nthe conversation. In this he was not disappointed.\n\n\"They say that to meet with him is worse than meeting with the devil,\"\nobserved another of the crew.\n\n\"Who ever saw him?\" said another.\n\n\"He has been seen, that's sartain, and just as sartain that ill-luck\nfollows the vessel that falls in with him.\"\n\n\"And where is he to be fallen in with?\"\n\n\"O! they say that's not so sartain--but he cruises off the Cape.\"\n\n\"I should like to know the whole long and short of the story,\" said a\nthird.\n\n\"I can only tell what I've heard. It's a doomed vessel; they were\npirates, and cut the captain's throat, I believe.\"\n\n\"No! no!\" cried Schriften, \"the captain is in her now--and a villain\nhe was. They say that, like somebody else on board of us now, he left\na very pretty wife, and that he was very fond of her.\"\n\n\"How do they know that, pilot?\"\n\n\"Because he always wants to send letters home when he boards vessels\nthat he falls in with. But, woe to the vessel that takes charge of\nthem!--she is sure to be lost, with every soul on board!\"\n\n\"I wonder where you heard all this,\" said one of the men. \"Did you\never see the vessel?\"\n\n\"Yes, I did!\" screamed Schriften; but, as if recovering himself, his\nscream subsided into his usual giggle, and he added, \"but we need not\nfear her, boys; we've a bit of the true cross on board.\" Schriften\nthen walked aft as if to avoid being questioned, when he perceived\nPhilip by the mainmast.\n\n\"So, I'm not the only one curious?--he! he! Pray did you bring that on\nboard, in case we should fall in with the _Flying Dutchman?_\"\n\n\"I fear no _Flying Dutchman_,\" replied Philip, confused.\n\n\"Now I think of it, you are of the same name; at least they say that\nhis name was Vanderdecken--eh?\"\n\n\"There are many Vanderdeckens in the world besides me,\" replied\nPhilip, who had recovered his composure; and having made this reply,\nhe walked away to the poop of the vessel.\n\n\"One would almost imagine this malignant one-eyed wretch was aware of\nthe cause of my embarkation,\" mused Philip; \"but no! that cannot be.\nWhy do I feel such a chill whenever he approaches me? I wonder if\nothers do; or whether it is a mere fancy on the part of Amine and\nmyself. I dare ask no questions.--Strange, too, that the man should\nfeel such malice towards me. I never injured him. What I have just\noverheard confirms all; but there needed no confirmation. Oh, Amine!\nAmine! but for thee, and I would rejoice to solve this riddle at the\nexpense of life. God in mercy check the current of my brain,\" muttered\nPhilip, \"or my reason cannot hold its seat!\"\n\nIn three days the _Ter Schilling_ and her consorts arrived at Table\nBay, where they found the remainder of the fleet at anchor waiting for\nthem. Just at that period the Dutch had formed a settlement at the\nCape of Good Hope, where the Indian fleets used to water and obtain\ncattle from the Hottentot tribes who lived on the coast, and who for\na brass button or a large nail would willingly offer a fat bullock. A\nfew days were occupied in completing the water of the squadron, and\nthen the ships, having received from the Admiral their instructions\nas to the rendezvous in case of parting company, and made every\npreparation for the bad weather which they anticipated, again weighed\ntheir anchors, and proceeded on their voyage.\n\nFor three days they beat against light and baffling winds, making but\nlittle progress; on the third, the breeze sprang up strong from the\nsouthward, until it increased to a gale, and the fleet were blown down\nto the northward of the bay. On the seventh day the _Ter Schilling_\nfound herself alone, but the weather had moderated. Sail was again\nmade upon the vessel, and her head put to the eastward, that she might\nrun in for the land.\n\n\"We are unfortunate in thus parting with all our consorts,\" observed\nMynheer Kloots to Philip, as they were standing at the gangway; \"but\nit must be near meridian, and the sun will enable me to discover our\nlatitude. It is difficult to say how far we may have been swept by the\ngale and the currents to the northward. Boy, bring up my cross-staff,\nand be mindful that you do not strike it against anything as you come\nup.\"\n\nThe cross-staff at that time was the simple instrument used to\ndiscover the latitude, which it would give to a nice observer to\nwithin five or ten miles. Quadrants and sextants were the invention\nof a much later period. Indeed, considering that they had so little\nknowledge of navigation and the variation of the compass, and that\ntheir easting and westing could only be computed by dead reckoning,\nit is wonderful how our ancestors traversed the ocean in the way they\ndid, with comparatively so few accidents.\n\n\"We are full three degrees to the northward of the Cape,\" observed\nMynheer Kloots, after he had computed his latitude. \"The currents must\nbe running strong; the wind is going down fast, and we shall have a\nchange, if I mistake not.\"\n\nTowards the evening it fell calm, with a heavy swell setting towards\nthe shore; shoals of seals appeared on the surface, following the\nvessel as she drove before the swell; the fish darted and leaped in\nevery direction, and the ocean around them appeared to be full of life\nas the sun slowly descended to the horizon.\n\n\"What is that noise we hear?\" observed Philip; \"it sounds like distant\nthunder.\"\n\n\"I hear it,\" replied Mynheer Kloots. \"Aloft there; do you see the\nland?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the man, after a pause in ascending the topmast\nshrouds. \"It is right ahead--low sand-hills, and the sea breaking\nhigh.\"\n\n\"Then that must be the noise we hear. We sweep in fast with this heavy\nground-swell. I wish the breeze would spring up.\"\n\nThe sun was dipping under the horizon, and the calm still continued:\nthe swell had driven the _Ter Schilling_ so rapidly on the shore that\nnow they could see the breakers, which fell over with the noise of\nthunder.\n\n\"Do you know the coast, pilot?\" observed the captain to Schriften, who\nstood by.\n\n\"Know it well,\" replied Schriften; \"the sea breaks in twelve\nfathoms at least. In half an hour the good ship will be beaten into\ntoothpicks, without a breeze to help us.\" And the little man giggled\nas if pleased at the idea.\n\nThe anxiety of Mynheer Kloots was not to be concealed; his pipe was\nevery moment in and out of his mouth. The crew remained in groups\non the forecastle and gangway, listening with dismay to the fearful\nroaring of the breakers. The sun had sunk down below the horizon, and\nthe gloom of night was gradually adding to the alarm of the crew of\nthe _Ter Schilling_.\n\n\"We must lower down the boats,\" said Mynheer Kloots to the first mate,\n\"and try to tow her off. We cannot do much good, I'm afraid; but at\nall events the boats will be ready for the men to get into before she\ndrives on shore. Get the tow ropes out and lower down the boats, while\nI go in to acquaint the supercargo.\"\n\nMynheer Von Stroom was sitting in all the dignity of his office, and\nit being Sunday had put on his very best wig. He was once more reading\nover the letter to the Company, relative to the bear, when Mynheer\nKloots made his appearance, and informed him in a few words that they\nwere in a situation of peculiar danger, and that in all probability\nthe ship would be in pieces in less than half an hour. At this\nalarming intelligence, Mynheer Von Stroom jumped up from his chair,\nand in his hurry and fear knocked down the candle which had just been\nlighted.\n\n\"In danger! Mynheer Kloots!--why, the water is smooth and the wind\ndown! My hat--where is my hat and my cane? I will go on deck. Quick! A\nlight--Mynheer Kloots, if you please to order a light to be brought; I\ncan find nothing in the dark. Mynheer Kloots, why do you not answer?\nMercy on me! he is gone and has left me.\"\n\nMynheer Kloots had gone to fetch a light, and now returned with it.\nMynheer Von Stroom put on his hat, and walked out of the cabin. The\nboats were down and the ship's head had been turned round from the\nland; but it was now quite dark, and nothing was to be seen but the\nwhite line of foam created by the breakers as they dashed with an\nawful noise against the shore.\n\n\"Mynheer Kloots, if you please, I'll leave the ship directly. Let my\nboat come alongside--I must have the largest boat for the Honourable\nCompany's service--for the papers and myself.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not, Mynheer Von Stroom,\" replied Kloots; \"our boats will\nhardly hold the men as it is, and every man's life is as valuable to\nhimself as yours is to you.\"\n\n\"But, Mynheer, I am the Company's supercargo. I order you--I will have\none--refuse if you dare.\"\n\n\"I dare, and do refuse,\" replied the captain, taking his pipe out of\nhis mouth.\n\n\"Well, well,\" replied Mynheer Von Stroom, who now lost all presence of\nmind--\"we will, sir as soon as we arrive--Lord help us!--we are lost.\nO Lord! O Lord!\" And here Mynheer Von Stroom, not knowing why, hurried\ndown to the cabin, and in his haste tumbled over the bear Johannes,\nwho crossed his path, and in his fall his hat and flowing wig parted\ncompany with his head.\n\n\"O mercy! where am I? Help--help here! for the Company's honourable\nsupercargo!\"\n\n\"Cast off there in the boats, and come on board,\" cried Mynheer\nKloots; \"we have no time to spare. Quick now, Philip, put in the\ncompass, the water, and the biscuit; we must leave her in five\nminutes.\"\n\nSo appalling was the roar of the breakers, that it was with difficulty\nthat the orders could be heard. In the meantime Mynheer Von Stroom lay\nupon the deck, kicking, sprawling, and crying for help.\n\n\"There is a light breeze off the shore,\" cried Philip, holding up his\nhand.\n\n\"There is, but I'm afraid it is too late. Hand the things into the\nboats, and be cool, my men. We have yet a chance of saving her, if the\nwind freshens.\"\n\nThey were now so near to the breakers that they felt the swell in\nwhich the vessel lay becalmed turned over here and there on its long\nline, but the breeze freshened, and the vessel was stationary! the\nmen were all in the boats, with the exception of Mynheer Kloots, the\nmates, and Mynheer Von Stroom.\n\n\"She goes through the water now,\" said Philip.\n\n\"Yes, I think we shall save her,\" replied the captain: \"steady as you\ngo, Hillebrant,\" continued he to the first mate, who was at the helm.\n\"We leave the breakers now--only let the breeze hold ten minutes.\"\n\nThe breeze was steady, the _Ter Schilling_ stood off from the land,\nagain it fell calm, and again she was swept towards the breakers; at\nlast the breeze came off strong, and the vessel cleaved through the\nwater. The men were called out of the boats; Mynheer Von Stroom was\npicked up along with his hat and wig, carried into the cabin, and in\nless than an hour the _Ter Schilling_ was out of danger.\n\n\"Now we will hoist up the boats,\" said Mynheer Kloots, \"and let us\nall, before we lie down to sleep, thank God for our deliverance.\"\n\nDuring that night the _Ter Schilling_ made an offing of twenty miles,\nand then stood to the southward; towards the morning the wind again\nfell, and it was nearly calm.\n\nMynheer Kloots had been on deck about an hour, and had been talking\nwith Hillebrant upon the danger of the evening, and the selfishness\nand pusillanimity of Mynheer Von Stroom, when a loud noise was heard\nin the poop-cabin.\n\n\"What can that be?\" said the captain; \"has the good man lost his\nsenses from the fright? Why, he is knocking the cabin to pieces.\"\n\nAt this moment the servant of the supercargo ran out of the cabin.\n\n\"Mynheer Kloots, hasten in--help my master--he will be killed--the\nbear!--the bear!\"\n\n\"The bear! what; Johannes?\" cried Mynheer Kloots. \"Why, the animal is\nas tame as a dog. I will go and see.\"\n\nBut before Mynheer Kloots could walk into the cabin, out flew in\nhis shirt the affrighted supercargo. \"My God! my God! am I to be\nmurdered?--eaten alive?\" cried he, running forward, and attempting to\nclimb the fore-rigging.\n\nMynheer Kloots followed the motions of Mynheer Von Stroom with\nsurprise, and when he found him attempting to mount the rigging, he\nturned aft and walked into the cabin, when he found to his surprise\nthat Johannes was indeed doing mischief.\n\nThe panelling of the state cabin of the supercargo had been beaten\ndown, the wig boxes lay in fragments on the floor, the two spare wigs\nwere lying by them, and upon them were strewed fragments of broken\npots and masses of honey, which Johannes was licking up with peculiar\ngusto.\n\nThe fact was, that when the ship anchored at Table Bay, Mynheer Von\nStroom, who was very partial to honey, had obtained some from the\nHottentots. The honey his careful servant had stowed away in jars,\nwhich he had placed at the bottom of the two long boxes, ready for his\nmaster's use during the remainder of the voyage. That morning, the\nservant fancying that the wig of the previous night had suffered when\nhis master tumbled over the bear, opened one of the boxes to take out\nanother. Johannes happened to come near the door, and scented the\nhoney. Now, partial as Mynheer Von Stroom was to honey, all bears are\nstill more so, and will venture everything to obtain it. Johannes had\nyielded to the impulse of his species, and, following the scent, had\ncome into the cabin, and was about to enter the sleeping-berth of\nMynheer Stroom, when the servant slammed the door in his face;\nwhereupon Johannes beat in the panels, and found an entrance. He then\nattacked the wig-boxes, and, by showing a most formidable set of\nteeth, proved to the servant, who attempted to drive him off, that he\nwould not be trifled with. In the meanwhile, Mynheer Von Stroom was in\nthe utmost terror: not aware of the purport of the bear's visit, he\nimagined that the animal's object was to attack him. His servant took\nto his heels after a vain effort to save the last box, and Mynheer\nVon Stroom, then finding himself alone, at length sprang out of his\nbed-place, and escaped as we have mentioned to the forecastle, leaving\nJohannes master of the field, and luxuriating upon the _spolia opima_.\nMynheer Kloots immediately perceived how the case stood. He went up\nto the bear and spoke to him, then kicked him, but the bear would not\nleave the honey, and growled furiously at the interruption. \"This is\na bad job for you, Johannes,\" observed Mynheer Kloots; \"now you will\nleave the ship, for the supercargo has just grounds of complaint. Oh,\nwell! you must eat the honey, because you will.\" So saying, Mynheer\nKloots left the cabin, and went to look after the supercargo, who\nremained on the forecastle, with his bald head and meagre body,\nharanguing the men in his shirt, which fluttered in the breeze.\n\n\"I am very sorry, Mynheer Von Stroom,\" said Kloots, \"but the bear\nshall be sent out of the vessel.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, Mynheer Kloots, but this is an affair for the most puissant\nCompany--the lives of their servants are not to be sacrificed to the\nfolly of a sea-captain. I have nearly been torn to pieces.\"\n\n\"The animal did not want you; all he wanted was the honey,\" replied\nKloots. \"He has got it, and I myself cannot take it from him. There is\nno altering the nature of an animal. Will you be pleased to walk down\ninto my cabin until the beast can be secured? He shall not go loose\nagain.\"\n\nMynheer Von Stroom, who considered his dignity at variance with his\nappearance, and who perhaps was aware that majesty deprived of its\nexternals was only a jest, thought it advisable to accept the offer.\nAfter some trouble, with the assistance of the seamen, the bear was\nsecured and dragged away from the cabin, much against his will, for he\nhad still some honey to lick off the curls of the full-bottomed wigs.\nHe was put into durance vile, having been caught in the flagrant act\nof burglary on the high seas. This new adventure was the topic of the\nday, for it was again a dead calm, and the ship lay motionless on the\nglassy wave.\n\n\"The sun looks red as he sinks,\" observed Hillebrant to the captain,\nwho with Philip was standing on the poop; \"we shall have wind before\nto-morrow, if I mistake not.\"\n\n\"I am of your opinion,\" replied Mynheer Kloots. \"It is strange that\nwe do not fall in with any of the vessels of the fleet. They must all\nhave been driven down here.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they have kept a wider offing.\"\n\n\"It had been as well if we had done the same,\" said Kloots. \"That was\na narrow escape last night. There is such a thing as having too little\nas well as having too much wind.\"\n\nA confused noise was heard among the seamen who were collected\ntogether, and looking in the direction of the vessel's quarter, \"A\nship! No--Yes, it is!\" was repeated more than once.\n\n\"They think they see a ship,\" said Schriften, coming on the poop. \"He!\nhe!\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"There in the gloom!\" said the pilot, pointing to the darkest quarter\nin the horizon, for the sun had set.\n\nThe captain, Hillebrant, and Philip directed their eyes to the quarter\npointed out, and thought they could perceive something like a vessel.\nGradually the gloom seemed to clear away, and a lambent pale blaze to\nlight up that part of the horizon. Not a breath of wind was on the\nwater--the sea was like a mirror--more and more distinct did the\nvessel appear, till her hull, masts and yards were clearly visible.\nThey looked and rubbed their eyes to help their vision, for scarcely\ncould they believe that which they did see. In the centre of the pale\nlight, which extended about fifteen degrees above the horizon, there\nwas indeed a large ship about three miles distant; but, although it\nwas a perfect calm, she was to all appearance buffeting in a violent\ngale, plunging and lifting over a surface that was smooth as glass,\nnow careening to her bearing, then recovering herself. Her topsails\nand mainsail were furled, and the yards pointed to the wind; she had\nno sail set, but a close-reefed fore-sail, a storm stay-sail, and\ntrysail abaft. She made little way through the water, but apparently\nneared them fast, driven down by the force of the gale. Each minute\nshe was plainer to the view. At last, she was seen to wear, and in so\ndoing, before she was brought to the wind on the other tack, she was\nso close to them that they could distinguish the men on board: they\ncould see the foaming water as it was hurled from her bows; hear the\nshrill whistle of the boatswain's pipes, the creaking of the ship's\ntimbers, and the complaining of her masts; and then the gloom\ngradually rose, and in a few seconds she had totally disappeared.\n\n\"God in heaven!\" exclaimed Mynheer Kloots.\n\nPhilip felt a hand upon his shoulder, and the cold darted through his\nwhole frame. He turned round and met the one eye of Schriften,\nwho screamed in his ear--\"PHILIP VANDERDECKEN--That's the _Flying\nDutchman!_\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter X\n\n\nThe sudden gloom which had succeeded to the pale light had the effect\nof rendering every object still more indistinct to the astonished crew\nof the _Ter Schilling_. For a moment or more not a word was uttered by\na soul on board. Some remained with their eyes still strained towards\nthe point where the apparition had been seen, others turned away full\nof gloomy and foreboding thoughts. Hillebrant was the first who spoke:\nturning round to the eastern quarter, and observing a light on the\nhorizon, he started, and seizing Philip by the arm, cried out, \"What's\nthat?\"\n\n\"That is only the moon rising from the bank of clouds,\" replied\nPhilip, mournfully.\n\n\"Well!\" observed Mynheer Kloots, wiping his forehead, which was damp\nwith perspiration, \"I _have_ been told of this before, but I have\nmocked at the narration.\"\n\nPhilip made no reply. Aware of the reality of the vision, and how\ndeeply it interested him, he felt as if he were a guilty person.\n\nThe moon had now risen above the clouds, and was pouring her mild pale\nlight over the slumbering ocean. With a simultaneous impulse, everyone\ndirected his eyes to the spot where the strange vision had last been\nseen; and all was a dead, dead calm.\n\nSince the apparition, the pilot, Schriften, had remained on the poop;\nhe now gradually approached Mynheer Kloots, and looking round, said--\n\n\"Mynheer Kloots, as pilot of this vessel, I tell you that you must\nprepare for very bad weather.\"\n\n\"Bad weather!\" said Kloots, rousing himself from a deep reverie.\n\n\"Yes, bad weather, Mynheer Kloots. There never was a vessel which\nfell in with--what we have just seen, but met with disaster soon\nafterwards. The very name of Vanderdecken is unlucky--He! he!\"\n\nPhilip would have replied to the sarcasm, but he could not, his tongue\nwas tied.\n\n\"What has the name of Vanderdecken to do with it?\" observed Kloots.\n\n\"Have you not heard, then? The captain of that vessel we have just\nseen is a Mynheer Vanderdecken--he is the Flying Dutchman!\"\n\n\"How know you that, pilot?\" inquired Hillebrant.\n\n\"I know that, and much more, if I chose to tell,\" replied Schriften;\n\"but never mind, I have warned you of bad weather, as is my duty;\"\nand, with these words, Schriften went down the poop-ladder.\n\n\"God in heaven! I never was so puzzled and so frightened in my life,\"\nobserved Kloots. \"I don't know what to think or say.--What think you,\nPhilip? was it not supernatural?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Philip, mournfully. \"I have no doubt of it.\"\n\n\"I thought the days of miracles had passed,\" said the captain, \"and\nthat we were now left to our own exertions, and had no other warnings\nbut those the appearance of the heavens gave us.\"\n\n\"And they warn us now,\" observed Hillebrant. \"See how that bank of\nclouds has risen within these five minutes--the moon has escaped from\nit, but it will soon catch her again--and see, there is a flash of\nlightning in the north-west.\"\n\n\"Well, my sons, I can brave the elements as well as any man, and do my\nbest. I have cared little for gales or stress of weather; but I like\nnot such a warning as we have had to-night. My heart's as heavy as\nlead, and that's the truth. Philip, send down for the bottle of\nschnapps, if it is only to clear my brain a little.\"\n\nPhilip was glad of an opportunity to quit the poop; he wished to have\na few minutes to recover himself and collect his own thoughts. The\nappearance of the Phantom Ship had been to him a dreadful shock--not\nthat he had not fully believed in its existence; but still, to have\nbeheld, to have been so near that vessel--that vessel in which his\nfather was fulfilling his awful doom--that vessel on board of which he\nfelt sure that his own destiny was to be worked out--had given a whirl\nto his brain. When he had heard the sound of the boatswain's whistle\non board of her, eagerly had he stretched his hearing to catch the\norder given--and given, he was convinced, in his father's voice. Nor\nhad his eyes been less called to aid in his attempt to discover the\nfeatures and dress of those moving on her decks. As soon, then, as he\nhad sent the boy up to Mynheer Kloots, Philip hastened to his\ncabin and buried his face in the coverlet of his bed, and then he\nprayed--prayed until he had recovered his usual energy and courage,\nand had brought his mind to that state of composure which could enable\nhim to look forward calmly to danger and difficulty, and feel prepared\nto meet it with the heroism of a martyr.\n\nPhilip remained below not more than half an hour. On his return to the\ndeck, what a change had taken place! He had left the vessel floating\nmotionless on the still waters, with her lofty sails hanging down\nlistlessly from the yards. The moon then soared aloft in her beauty,\nreflecting the masts and sails of the ship in extended lines upon the\nsmooth sea. Now all was dark: the water rippled short and broke in\nfoam; the smaller and lofty sails had been taken in, and the vessel\nwas cleaving through the water; and the wind, in fitful gusts and\nangry moanings, proclaimed too surely that it had been awakened up to\nwrath, and was gathering its strength for destruction. The men\nwere still busy reducing the sails, but they worked gloomily and\ndiscontentedly. What Schriften, the pilot, had said to them, Philip\nknew not, but that they avoided him and appeared to look upon him with\nfeelings of ill-will, was evident. And each minute the gale increased.\n\n\"The wind is not steady,\" observed Hillebrant; \"there is no saying\nfrom which quarter the storm may blow: it has already veered round\nfive points. Philip, I don't much like the appearance of things, and I\nmay say with the captain that my heart is heavy.\"\n\n\"And, indeed, so is mine,\" replied Philip; \"but we are in the hands of\na merciful Providence.\"\n\n\"Hard a-port! flatten in forward! brail up the trysail, my men!\nBe smart!\" cried Kloots, as from the wind's chopping round to the\nnorthward and westward, the ship was taken aback, and careened low\nbefore it. The rain now came down in torrents, and it was so dark that\nit was with difficulty they could perceive each other on the deck.\n\n\"We must clew up the topsails, while the men can get upon the yards.\nSee to it forward, Mr Hillebrant.\"\n\nThe lightning now darted athwart the firmament, and the thunder\npealed.\n\n\"Quick! quick, my men, let's furl all!\"\n\nThe sailors shook the water from their streaming clothes, some worked,\nothers took advantage of the night to hide themselves away, and\ncommune with their own fears.\n\nAll canvas was now taken off the ship, except the fore-staysail, and\nshe flew to the southward with the wind on her quarter. The sea had\nnow risen, and roared as it curled in foam, the rain fell in torrents,\nthe night was dark as Erebus, and the wet and frightened sailors\nsheltered themselves under the bulwarks. Although many had deserted\nfrom their duty, there was not one who ventured below that night. They\ndid not collect together as usual--every man preferred solitude and\nhis own thoughts. The Phantom Ship dwelt on their imaginations, and\noppressed their brains.\n\nIt was an interminably long and terrible night--they thought the day\nwould never come. At last the darkness gradually changed to a settled\nsullen grey gloom--which was day. They looked at each other, but found\nno comfort in meeting each other's eyes. There was no one countenance\nin which a beam of hope could be found lurking. They were all\ndoomed--they remained crouched where they had sheltered themselves\nduring the night, and said nothing.\n\nThe sea had now risen mountains high, and more than once had struck\nthe ship abaft. Kloots was at the binnacle, Hillebrant and Philip at\nthe helm, when a wave curled high over the quarter, and poured itself\nin resistless force upon the deck. The captain and his two mates were\nswept away, and dashed almost senseless against the bulwarks--the\nbinnacle and compass were broken into fragments--no one ran to the\nhelm--the vessel broached to--the seas broke clear over her, and the\nmainmast went by the board.\n\nAll was confusion. Captain Kloots was stunned, and it was with\ndifficulty that Philip could persuade two of the men to assist him\ndown below. Hillebrant had been more unfortunate--his right arm was\nbroken, and he was otherwise severely bruised; Philip assisted him to\nhis berth, and then went on deck again to try and restore order.\n\nPhilip Vanderdecken was not yet much of a seaman, but, at all events,\nhe exercised that moral influence over the men which is ever possessed\nby resolution and courage. Obey willingly they did not, but they did\nobey, and in half an hour the vessel was clear of the wreck. Eased by\nthe loss of her heavy mast, and steered by two of her best seamen, she\nagain flew before the gale.\n\nWhere was Mynheer Von Stroom during all this work of destruction? In\nhis bed-place, covered up with the clothes, trembling in every limb,\nand vowing that if ever again he put his foot on shore, not all the\ncompanies in the world should induce him to trust to salt-water again.\nIt certainly was the best plan for the poor man.\n\nBut although for a time the men obeyed the orders of Philip, they\nwere soon seen talking earnestly with the one-eyed pilot, and after a\nconsultation of a quarter of an hour, they all left the deck, with the\nexception of the two at the helm. Their reasons for so doing were soon\napparent--several returned with cans full of liquor, which they had\nobtained by forcing the hatches of the spirit-room. For about an\nhour Philip remained on deck, persuading the men not to intoxicate\nthemselves, but in vain; the cans of grog offered to the men at the\nwheel were not refused, and, in a short time, the yawing of the vessel\nproved that the liquor had taken its effect. Philip then hastened down\nbelow to ascertain if Mynheer Kloots was sufficiently recovered to\ncome on deck. He found him sunk into a deep sleep, and with difficulty\nit was that he roused him, and made him acquainted with the\ndistressing intelligence. Mynheer Kloots followed Philip on deck, but\nhe still suffered from his fall: his head was confused, and he reeled\nas he walked, as if he also had been making free with the liquor. When\nhe had been on deck a few minutes, he sank down on one of the guns in\na state of perfect helplessness; he had, in fact, received a severe\nconcussion of the brain. Hillebrant was too severely injured to\nbe able to move from his bed, and Philip was now aware of the\nhelplessness of their situation. Daylight gradually disappeared, and,\nas darkness came upon them, so did the scene become more appalling.\nThe vessel still ran before the gale, but the men at the helm had\nevidently changed her course, as the wind that was on the starboard\nwas now on the larboard quarter. But compass there was none on deck,\nand, even if there had been, the men in their drunken state would have\nrefused to listen to Philip's orders or expostulations. \"He,\" they\nsaid, \"was no sailor, and was not to teach them how to steer the ship\"\nThe gale was now at its height. The rain had ceased, but the wind had\nincreased, and it roared as it urged on the vessel, which, steered so\nwide by the drunken sailors, shipped seas over each gunnel; but the\nmen laughed and joined the chorus of their songs to the howling of the\ngale.\n\nSchriften, the pilot, appeared to be the leader of the ship's company.\nWith the can of liquor in his hand, he danced and sang, snapped his\nfingers, and, like a demon, peered with his one eye upon Philip; and\nthen would he fall and roll with screams of laughter in the scuppers.\nMore liquor was handed up as fast as it was called for. Oaths,\nshrieks, laughter, were mingled together; the men at the helm lashed\nit amidships, and hastened to join their companions, and the _Ter\nSchilling_ flew before the gale; the fore-staysail being the only\nsail set, checking her as she yawed to starboard or to port. Philip\nremained on deck by the poop-ladder. \"Strange,\" thought he, \"that I\nshould stand here, the only one left now capable of acting,--that\nI should be fated to look by myself upon this scene of horror and\ndisgust--should here wait the severing of this vessel's timbers,--the\nloss of life which must accompany it,--the only one calm and\ncollected, or aware of what must soon take place. God forgive me, but\nI appear, useless and impotent as I am, to stand here like the master\nof the storm,--separated as it were from my brother mortals by my\nown peculiar destiny. It must be so. This wreck then must not be for\nme,--I feel that it is not,--that I have a charmed life, or rather a\nprotracted one, to fulfil the oath I registered in heaven. But the\nwind is not so loud, surely the water is not so rough: my forebodings\nmay be wrong, and all may yet be saved. Heaven grant it! For how\nmelancholy, how lamentable is it, to behold men created in God's own\nimage, leaving the world, disgraced below the brute creation!\"\n\nPhilip was right in supposing that the wind was not so strong, nor\nthe sea so high. The vessel, after running to the southward till past\nTable Bay, had, by the alteration made in her course, entered into\nFalse Bay, where, to a certain degree, she was sheltered from the\nviolence of the winds and waves. But, although the water was smoother,\nthe waves were still more than sufficient to beat to pieces any vessel\nthat might be driven on shore at the bottom of the bay, to which point\nthe _Ter Schilling_ was now running. The bay so far offered a fair\nchance of escape, as, instead of the rocky coast outside (against\nwhich, had the vessel run, a few seconds would have insured her\ndestruction), there was a shelving beach of loose sand. But of this\nPhilip could, of course, have no knowledge, for the land at the\nentrance of the Bay had been passed unperceived in the darkness of the\nnight. About twenty minutes more had elapsed, when Philip observed\nthat the whole sea around them was one continued foam. He had hardly\ntime for conjecture before the ship struck heavily on the sands, and\nthe remaining masts fell by the board.\n\nThe crash of the falling masts, the heavy beating of the ship on the\nsands, which caused many of her timbers to part, with a whole sea\nwhich swept clean over the fated vessel, checked the songs and drunken\nrevelry of the crew. Another minute, and the vessel was swung round on\nher broadside to the sea, and lay on her beam ends. Philip, who was\nto windward, clung to the bulwark, while the intoxicated seamen\nfloundered in the water to leeward, and attempted to gain the other\nside of the ship. Much to Philip's horror, he perceived the body of\nMynheer Kloots sink down in the water (which now was several feet deep\non the lee side of the deck) without any apparent effort on the part\nof the captain to save himself. He was then gone, and there were no\nhopes for him. Philip thought of Hillebrant, and hastened down below;\nhe found him still in his bed-place, lying against the side. He lifted\nhim out, and with difficulty climbed with him on deck, and laid him in\nthe long-boat on the booms, as the best chance of saving his life. To\nthis boat, the only one which could be made available, the crew had\nalso repaired; but they repulsed Philip, who would have got into her;\nand, as the sea made clean breakers over them, they cast loose the\nlashings which confined her. With the assistance of another heavy sea\nwhich lifted her from the chocks, she was borne clear of the booms\nand dashed over the gunnel into the water, to leeward, which was\ncomparatively smooth--not, however, without being filled nearly up to\nthe thwarts. But this was little cared for by the intoxicated seamen,\nwho, as soon as they were afloat, again raised their shouts and songs\nof revelry as they were borne away by the wind and sea towards the\nbeach. Philip, who held on by the stump of the mainmast, watched them\nwith an anxious eye, now perceiving them borne aloft on the foaming\nsurf, now disappearing in the trough. More and more distant were the\nsounds of their mad voices, till, at last, he could hear them no\nmore,--he beheld the boat balanced on an enormous rolling sea, and\nthen he saw it not again.\n\nPhilip knew that now his only chance was to remain with the vessel,\nand attempt to save himself upon some fragment of the wreck. That the\nship would long hold together he felt was impossible; already she had\nparted her upper decks, and each shock of the waves divided her more\nand more. At last, as he clung to the mast, he heard a noise abaft,\nand he then recollected that Mynheer Von Stroom was still in his\ncabin. Philip crawled aft, and found that the poop-ladder had been\nthrown against the cabin door, so as to prevent its being opened. He\nremoved it and entered the cabin, where he found Mynheer Von Stroom\nclinging to windward with the grasp of death,--but it was not death,\nbut the paralysis of fear. He spoke to him, but could obtain no reply;\nhe attempted to move him, but it was impossible to make him let go the\npart of the bulk-head that he grasped. A loud noise and the rush of a\nmass of water told Philip that the vessel had parted amidships, and he\nunwillingly abandoned the poor supercargo to his fate, and went out\nof the cabin door. At the after-hatchway he observed something\nstruggling,--it was Johannes the bear, who was swimming, but still\nfastened by a cord which prevented his escape. Philip took out his\nknife, and released the poor animal, and hardly had he done this act\nof kindness when a heavy sea turned over the after part of the vessel,\nwhich separated in many pieces, and Philip found himself struggling in\nthe waves. He seized upon a part of the deck which supported him, and\nwas borne away by the surf towards the beach. In a few minutes he was\nnear to the land, and shortly afterwards the piece of planking to\nwhich he was clinging struck on the sand, and then, being turned over\nby the force of the running wave, Philip lost his hold, and was left\nto his own exertions. He struggled long, but, although so near to the\nshore, could not gain a footing; the returning wave dragged him back,\nand thus was he hurled to and fro until his strength was gone. He was\nsinking under the wave to rise no more, when he felt something touch\nhis hand. He seized it with the grasp of death. It was the shaggy\nhide of the bear Johannes, who was making for the shore, and who soon\ndragged him clear of the surf, so that he could gain a footing. Philip\ncrawled up the beach above the reach of the waves, and, exhausted with\nfatigue, sank down in a swoon.\n\nWhen Philip was recalled from his state of lethargy, his first feeling\nwas intense pain in his still closed eyes, arising from having been\nmany hours exposed to the rays of an ardent sun. He opened them, but\nwas obliged to close them immediately, for the light entered into them\nlike the point of a knife. He turned over on his side, and covering\nthem with his hand, remained some time in that position, until, by\ndegrees, he found that his eyesight was restored. He then rose, and,\nafter a few seconds could distinguish the scene around him. The sea\nwas still rough, and tossed about in the surf fragments of the vessel;\nthe whole sand was strewed with her cargo and contents. Near him was\nthe body of Hillebrant, and the other bodies who were scattered on the\nbeach told him that those who had taken to the boat had all perished.\n\nIt was, by the height of the sun, about three o'clock in the\nafternoon, as near as he could estimate; but Philip suffered such an\noppression of mind, he felt so wearied, and in such pain, that he took\nbut a slight survey. His brain was whirling, and all he demanded was\nrepose. He walked away from the scene of destruction, and having found\na sandhill, behind which he was defended from the burning rays of the\nsun, he again lay down, and sank into a deep sleep, from which he did\nnot wake until the ensuing morning.\n\nPhilip was roused a second time by the sensation of something pricking\nhim on the chest. He started up, and beheld a figure standing over\nhim. His eyes were still feeble, and his vision indistinct; he rubbed\nthem for a time, for he first thought it was the bear Johannes, and\nagain that it was the supercargo Von Stroom who had appeared before\nhim; he looked again, and found that he was mistaken, although he had\nwarrant for supposing it to be either or both. A tall Hottentot, with\nan assagai in his hand, stood by his side; over his shoulder he had\nthrown the fresh-severed skin of the poor bear, and on his head,\nwith the curls descending to his waist, was one of the wigs of the\nsupercargo Von Stroom. Such was the gravity of the black's appearance\nin this strange costume (for in every other respect he was naked),\nthat, at any other time, Philip would have been induced to laugh\nheartily, but his feelings were now too acute. He rose upon his feet\nand stood by the side of the Hottentot, who still continued immovable,\nbut certainly without the slightest appearance of hostile intentions.\n\nA sensation of overpowering thirst now seized upon Philip, and he\nmade signs that he wished to drink. The Hottentot motioned to him\nto follow, and led over the sand-hills to the beach, where Philip\ndiscovered upwards of fifty men, who were busy selecting various\narticles from the scattered stores of the vessel. It was evident by\nthe respect paid to Philip's conductor, that he was the chief of\nthe kraal. A few words, uttered with the greatest solemnity, were\nsufficient to produce, though not exactly what Philip required, a\nsmall quantity of dirty water from a calabash, which, however, was, to\nhim, delicious. His conductor then waved to him to take a seat on the\nsand.\n\nIt was a novel and appalling, and nevertheless a ludicrous scene:\nthere was the white sand, rendered still more white by the strong\nglare of the sun, strewed with the fragments of the vessel, with casks\nand bales of merchandise; there was the running surge with its foam,\nthrowing about particles of the wreck; there were the bones of whales\nwhich had been driven on shore in some former gale, and which now,\nhalf-buried in the sand, showed portions of huge skeletons; there were\nthe mangled bodies of Philip's late companions, whose clothes, it\nappeared, had been untouched by the savages, with the exception of\nthe buttons, which had been eagerly sought after; there were naked\nHottentots (for it was summer time, and they wore not their sheepskin\nkrosses) gravely stepping up and down the sand, picking up everything\nthat was of no value, and leaving all that civilised people most\ncoveted;--to crown all, there was the chief, sitting in the still\nbloody skin of Johannes and the broad-bottomed wig of Mynheer Stroom,\nwith all the gravity of a vice-chancellor in his countenance, and\nwithout the slightest idea that he was in any way ridiculous. The\nwhole presented, perhaps, one of the most strange and chaotic tableaux\nthat ever was witnessed.\n\nAlthough, at that time, the Dutch had not very long formed their\nsettlement at the Cape, a considerable traffic had been, for many\nyears, carried on with the natives for skins and other African\nproductions. The Hottentots were therefore no strangers to vessels,\nand, as hitherto they had been treated with kindness, were\nwell-disposed towards Europeans. After a time, the Hottentots began\nto collect all the wood which appeared to have iron in it, made it up\ninto several piles, and set them on fire. The chief then made a\nsign to Philip, to ask him if he was hungry; Philip replied in the\naffirmative, when his new acquaintance put his hand into a bag made\nof goat-skin, and pulled out a handful of very large beetles, and\npresented them to him. Philip refused them with marks of disgust,\nupon which the chief very sedately cracked and ate them; and having\nfinished the whole handful, rose, and made a sign to Philip to follow\nhim. As Philip rose, he perceived floating on the surf his own chest;\nhe hastened to it, and made signs that it was his, took the key out of\nhis pocket, and opened it, and then made up a bundle of articles\nmost useful, not forgetting a bag of guilders. His conductor made no\nobjection, but calling to one of the men near, pointed out the lock\nand hinges to him, and then set off, followed by Philip, across the\nsand-hills. In about an hour they arrived at the kraal, consisting of\nlow huts covered with skins, and were met by the women and children,\nwho appeared to be in high admiration at their chief's new attire:\nthey showed every kindness to Philip, bringing him milk, which he\ndrank eagerly. Philip surveyed these daughters of Eve, and, as he\nturned from their offensive, greasy attire, their strange forms, and\nhideous features, he sighed and thought of his charming Amine.\n\nThe sun was now setting, and Philip still felt fatigued. He made\nsigns that he wished to repose. They led him into a hut, and, though\nsurrounded as he was with filth, and his nose assailed by every\nvariety of bad smell, attacked moreover by insects, he laid his head\non his bundle, and uttering a short prayer of thanksgiving, was soon\nin a sound sleep.\n\nThe next morning he was awakened by the chief of the kraal,\naccompanied by another man who spoke a little Dutch. He stated his\nwish to be taken to the settlement where the ships came and anchored,\nand was fully understood; but the man said that there were no ships in\nthe bay at the time. Philip nevertheless requested he might be taken\nthere, as he felt that his best chance of getting on board of any\nvessel would be by remaining at the settlement, and, at all events,\nhe would be in the company of Europeans until a vessel arrived. The\ndistance he discovered was but one day's march, or less. After some\nlittle conversation with the chief, the man who spoke Dutch desired\nPhilip to follow him, and he would take him there. Philip drank\nplentifully from a bowl of milk brought him by one of the women, and\nagain refusing a handful of beetles offered by the chief, he took up\nhis bundle, and followed his new acquaintance.\n\nTowards evening they arrived at the hills, from which Philip had a\nview of Table Bay, and the few houses erected by the Dutch. To his\ndelight, he perceived that there was a vessel under sail in the\noffing. On his arrival at the beach, to which he hastened, he found\nthat she had sent a boat on shore for fresh provisions. He accosted\nthe people, told them who he was, told them also of the fatal wreck of\nthe _Ter Schilling_, and of his wish to embark.\n\nThe officer in charge of the boat willingly consented to take him on\nboard, and informed Philip that they were homeward bound. Philip's\nheart leaped at the intelligence. Had she been outward bound, he would\nhave joined her; but now he had a prospect of again seeing his dear\nAmine, before he re-embarked to follow out his peculiar destiny. He\nfelt that there was still some happiness in store for him, that his\nlife was to be chequered with alternate privation and repose, and that\nhis future prospect was not to be one continued chain of suffering\nuntil death.\n\nHe was kindly received by the captain of the vessel, who freely gave\nhim a passage home; and in three months, without any events worth\nnarrating, Philip Vanderdecken found himself once more at anchor\nbefore the town of Amsterdam.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XI\n\n\nIt need hardly be observed, that Philip made all possible haste to his\nown little cottage, which contained all that he valued in this world.\nHe promised to himself some months of happiness, for he had done his\nduty; and he felt that, however desirous of fulfilling his vow, he\ncould not again leave home till the autumn, when the next fleet\nsailed, and it was now but the commencement of April. Much, too, as he\nregretted the loss of Mynheer Kloots and Hillebrant, as well as the\ndeaths of the unfortunate crew, still there was some solace in the\nremembrance that he was for ever rid of the wretch Schriften, who had\nshared their fate; and besides, he almost blessed the wreck, so fatal\nto others, which enabled him so soon to return to the arms of his\nAmine.\n\nIt was late in the evening when Philip took a boat from Flushing, and\nwent over to his cottage at Terneuse. It was a rough evening for the\nseason of the year. The wind blew fresh, and the sky was covered with\nflaky clouds, fringed here and there with broad white edges, for the\nlight of the moon was high in the heavens, and she was at her full. At\ntimes her light would be almost obscured by a dark cloud passing over\nher disc; at others, she would burst out in all her brightness. Philip\nlanded, and wrapping his cloak round him, hastened up to his cottage.\nAs with a beating heart he approached, he perceived that the window of\nthe parlour was open, and that there was a female figure leaning\nout. He knew that it could be no other than his Amine, and, after he\ncrossed the little bridge, he proceeded to the window, instead of\ngoing to the door. Amine (for it was she who stood at the window) was\nso absorbed in contemplation of the heavens above her, and so deep in\ncommunion with her own thoughts, that she neither saw nor heard the\napproach of her husband. Philip perceived her abstraction, and paused\nwhen within four or five yards of her. He wished to gain the door\nwithout being observed, as he was afraid of alarming her by his too\nsudden appearance, for he remembered his promise, \"that if dead he\nwould, if permitted, visit her as his father had visited his mother.\"\nBut while he thus stood in suspense, Amine's eyes were turned upon\nhim: she beheld him, but a thick cloud now obscured the moon's disc,\nand the dim light gave to his form, indistinctly seen, an unearthly\nand shadowy appearance. She recognised her husband; but having no\nreason to expect his return, she recognised him as an inhabitant of\nthe world of spirits. She started, parted the hair away from her\nforehead with both hands, and again earnestly gazed on him.\n\n\"It is I, Amine, do not be afraid,\" cried Philip, hastily.\n\n\"I am not afraid,\" replied Amine, pressing her hand to her heart. \"It\nis over now: spirit of my dear husband--for such I think thou art, I\nthank thee! Welcome, even in death, Philip, welcome!\" and Amine waved\nher hand mournfully, inviting Philip to enter, as she retired from the\nwindow.\n\n\"My God! she thinks me dead,\" thought Philip, and hardly knowing how\nto act, he entered in at the window, and found her sitting on the\nsofa. Philip would have spoken; but Amine, whose eyes were fixed upon\nhim as he entered, and who was fully convinced that he was but a\nsupernatural appearance, exclaimed--\n\n\"So soon--so soon! O God! thy will be done: but it is hard to bear.\nPhilip, beloved Philip! I feel that I soon shall follow you.\"\n\nPhilip was now more alarmed: he was fearful of any sudden reaction\nwhen Amine should discover that he was still alive.\n\n\"Amine, dear, hear me. I have appeared unexpectedly, and at an unusual\nhour; but throw yourself into my arms, and you will find that your\nPhilip is not dead.\"\n\n\"Not dead!\" cried Amine, starting up.\n\n\"No, no, still warm in flesh and blood, Amine--still your fond and\ndoting husband,\" replied Philip, catching her in his arms, and\npressing her to his heart.\n\nAmine sank from his embrace down upon the sofa, and fortunately was\nrelieved by a burst of tears, while Philip, kneeling by her, supported\nher.\n\n\"O God! O God! I thank thee,\" replied Amine, at last. \"I thought it\nwas your spirit, Philip. O I was glad to see even that,\" continued\nshe, weeping on his shoulder.\n\n\"Can you listen to me, dearest?\" said Philip, after a silence of a few\nmoments.\n\n\"O speak, speak, love; I can listen for ever.\"\n\nIn a few words Philip then recounted what had taken place, and the\noccasion of his unexpected return, and felt himself more than repaid\nfor all that he had suffered by the fond endearments of his still\nagitated Amine.\n\n\"And your father, Amine?\"\n\n\"He is well--we will talk of him to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" thought Philip, as he awoke next morning, and dwelt upon the\nlovely features of his still slumbering wife: \"yes, God is merciful.\nI feel that there is still happiness in store for me; nay more, that\nthat happiness also depends upon my due performance of my task, and\nthat I should be punished if I were to forget my solemn vow. Be it\nso,--through danger and to death will I perform my duty, trusting to\nhis mercy for a reward both here below and in heaven above. Am I not\nrepaid for all that I have suffered? O yes, more than repaid,\" thought\nPhilip, as, with a kiss, he disturbed the slumber of his wife, and met\nher full dark eyes fixed upon him, beaming with love and joy.\n\nBefore Philip Went downstairs, he inquired about Mynheer Poots.\n\n\"My father has indeed troubled me much,\" replied Amine. \"I am obliged\nto lock the parlour when I leave it, for more than once I have found\nhim attempting to force the locks of the buffets. His love of gold is\ninsatiable: he dreams of nothing else. He has caused me much pain,\ninsisting that I never should see you again, and that I should\nsurrender to him all your wealth. But he fears me, and he fears your\nreturn much more.\"\n\n\"Is he well in health?\"\n\n\"Not ill, but still evidently wasting away,--like a candle burnt down\nto the socket, flitting and flaring alternately; at one time almost\nimbecile, at others, talking and planning as if he were in the vigour\nof his youth. O what a curse it must be--that love of money! I\nbelieve--I'm shocked to say so, Philip,--that that poor old man,\nnow on the brink of a grave into which he can take nothing, would\nsacrifice your life and mine to have possession of those guilders, the\nwhole of which I would barter for one kiss from thee.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Amine, has he then attempted anything in my absence?\"\n\n\"I dare not speak my thoughts, Philip, nor will I venture\nupon surmises, which it were difficult to prove. I watch him\ncarefully;--but talk no more about him. You will see him soon, and do\nnot expect a hearty welcome, or believe that, if given, it is sincere.\nI will not tell him of your return, as I wish to mark the effect.\"\n\nAmine then descended to prepare breakfast, and Philip walked out for\na few minutes. On his return, he found Mynheer Poots sitting at the\ntable with his daughter.\n\n\"Merciful Allah! am I right?\" cried the old man: \"is it you, Mynheer\nVanderdecken?\"\n\n\"Even so,\" replied Philip, \"I returned last night.\"\n\n\"And you did not tell me, Amine.\"\n\n\"I wished that you should be surprised,\" replied Amine.\n\n\"I am surprised! When do you sail again, Mynheer Philip? very soon, I\nsuppose? perhaps to-morrow?\" said Mynheer Poots.\n\n\"Not for many months, I trust,\" replied Philip.\n\n\"Not for many months!--that is a long while to be idle. You must make\nmoney. Tell me, have you brought back plenty this time?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Philip; \"I have been wrecked, and very nearly lost my\nlife.\"\n\n\"But you will go again?\"\n\n\"Yes, in good time I shall go again.\"\n\n\"Very well, we will take care of your house and your guilders.\"\n\n\"I shall perhaps save you the trouble of taking care of my guilders,\"\nreplied Philip, to annoy the old man, \"for I mean to take them with\nme.\"\n\n\"To take them with you! for what, pray?\" replied Poots, in alarm.\n\n\"To purchase goods where I go, and make more money.\"\n\n\"But you may be wrecked again, and then the money will be all lost.\nNo, no; go yourself, Mynheer Philip; but you must not take your\nguilders.\"\n\n\"Indeed I will,\" replied Philip; \"when I leave this, I shall take all\nmy money with me.\"\n\nDuring this conversation it occurred to Philip that, if Mynheer Poots\ncould only be led to suppose that he took away his money with him,\nthere would be more quiet for Amine, who was now obliged, as she had\ninformed him, to be constantly on the watch. He determined, therefore,\nwhen he next departed, to make the doctor believe that he had taken\nhis wealth with him.\n\nMynheer Poots did not renew the conversation, but sank into gloomy\nthought. In a few minutes he left the parlour, and went up to his own\nroom, when Philip stated to his wife what had induced him to make the\nold man believe that he should embark his property.\n\n\"It was thoughtful of you, Philip, and I thank you for your kind\nfeeling towards me; but I wish you had said nothing on the subject.\nYou do not know my father; I must now watch him as an enemy.\"\n\n\"We have little to fear from an infirm old man,\" replied Philip,\nlaughing. But Amine thought otherwise, and was ever on her guard.\n\nThe spring and summer passed rapidly away, for they were happy. Many\nwere the conversations between Philip and Amine, relative to what had\npassed--the supernatural appearance of his father's ship, and the\nfatal wreck.\n\nAmine felt that more dangers and difficulties were preparing for her\nhusband, but she never once attempted to dissuade him from renewing\nhis attempts in fulfilment of his vow. Like him, she looked forward\nwith hope and confidence, aware that, at some time, his fate must be\naccomplished, and trusting only that that hour would be long delayed.\n\nAt the close of the summer, Philip again went to Amsterdam, to procure\nfor himself a berth in one of the vessels which were to sail at the\napproach of winter.\n\nThe wreck of the _Ter Schilling_ was well known; and the circumstances\nattending it, with the exception of the appearance of the Phantom\nShip, had been drawn up by Philip on his passage home, and\ncommunicated to the Court of Directors. Not only on account of the\nvery creditable manner in which that report had been prepared, but\nin consideration of his peculiar sufferings and escape, he had been\npromised by the Company a berth, as second mate, on board of one of\ntheir vessels, should he be again inclined to sail to the East Indies.\n\nHaving called upon the Directors, he received his appointment to the\n_Batavia_, a fine vessel of about 400 tons burden. Having effected his\npurpose, Philip hastened back to Terneuse, and, in the presence of\nMynheer Poots, informed Amine of what he had done.\n\n\"So you go to sea again?\" observed Mynheer Poots.\n\n\"Yes, but not for two months, I expect,\" replied Philip.\n\n\"Ah!\" replied Poots, \"in two months!\" and the old man muttered to\nhimself.\n\nHow true it is that we can more easily bear up against a real evil\nthan against suspense! Let it not be supposed that Amine fretted\nat the thought of her approaching separation from her husband; she\nlamented it, but feeling his departure to be an imperious duty, and\nhaving it ever in her mind, she bore up against her feelings, and\nsubmitted, without repining, to what could not be averted. There was,\nhowever, one circumstance, which caused her much uneasiness--that was\nthe temper and conduct of her father. Amine, who knew his character\nwell, perceived that he already secretly hated Philip, whom he\nregarded as an obstacle to his obtaining possession of the money in\nthe house; for the old man was well aware that, if Philip were dead,\nhis daughter would care little who had possession of, or what became\nof it. The thought that Philip was about to take that money with him\nhad almost turned the brain of the avaricious old man. He had been\nwatched by Amine, and she had seen him walk for hours muttering to\nhimself, and not, as usual, attending to his profession.\n\nA few evenings after his return from Amsterdam, Philip, who had taken\ncold, complained of not being well.\n\n\"Not well!\" cried the old man, starting up; \"let me see--yes, your\npulse is very quick. Amine, your poor husband is very ill. He must go\nto bed, and I will give him something which will do him good. I shall\ncharge you nothing, Philip--nothing at all.\"\n\n\"I do not feel so very unwell, Mynheer Poots,\" replied Philip; I have\nhad a bad headache certainly.\"\n\n\"Yes, and you have fever also, Philip, and prevention is better than\ncure; so go to bed, and take what I send you, and you will be well\nto-morrow.\"\n\nPhilip went upstairs, accompanied by Amine; and Mynheer Poots went\ninto his own room to prepare the medicine. So soon as Philip was in\nbed, Amine went downstairs, and was met by her father, who put a\npowder into her hands to give to her husband, and then left the\nparlour.\n\n\"God forgive me if I wrong my father,\" thought Amine; \"but I have my\ndoubts. Philip is ill, more so than he will acknowledge; and if he\ndoes not take some remedies, he may be worse--but my heart misgives\nme--I have a foreboding. Yet surely he cannot be so diabolically\nwicked.\"\n\nAmine examined the contents of the paper: it was a very small quantity\nof dark brown powder, and, by the directions of Mynheer Poots, to be\ngiven in a tumbler of warm wine. Mynheer Poots had offered to heat the\nwine. His return from the kitchen broke Amine's meditations.\n\n\"Here is the wine, my child; now give him a whole tumbler of wine, and\nthe powder, and let him be covered up warm, for the perspiration will\nsoon burst out, and it must not be checked. Watch him, Amine, and keep\nthe clothes on, and he will be well to-morrow morning.\" And Mynheer\nPoots quitted the room, saying, \"Good-night, my child.\"\n\nAmine poured out the powder into one of the silver mugs upon the\ntable, and then proceeded to mix it up with the wine. Her suspicions\nhad, for the time, been removed by the kind tone of her father's\nvoice. To do him justice as a medical practitioner, he appeared always\nto be most careful of his patients. When Amine mixed the powder, she\nexamined and perceived that there was no sediment, and the wine was as\nclear as before. This was unusual, and her suspicions revived.\n\n\"I like it not,\" said she; \"I fear my father--God help me!--I hardly\nknow what to do--I will not give it to Philip. The warm wine may\nproduce perspiration sufficient.\"\n\nAmine paused, and again reflected. She had mixed the powder with so\nsmall a portion of wine that it did not fill a quarter of the cup; she\nput it on one side, filled another up to the brim with the warm wine,\nand then went up to the bedroom.\n\nOn the landing-place she was met by her father, whom she supposed to\nhave retired to rest.\n\n\"Take care you do not spill it, Amine. That is right, let him have a\nwhole cupful. Stop, give it to me; I will take it to him myself.\"\n\nMynheer Poots took the cup from Amine's hands, and went into Philip's\nroom.\n\n\"Here, my son, drink this off, and you will be well,\" said Mynheer\nPoots, whose hand trembled so that he spilt the wine on the coverlet.\nAmine, who watched her father, was more than ever pleased that she had\nnot put the powder into the cup. Philip rose on his elbow, drank off\nthe wine, and Mynheer Poots then wished him good-night.\n\n\"Do not leave him, Amine, I will see all right,\" said Mynheer Poots,\nas he left the room. And Amine, who had intended to go down for the\ncandle left in the parlour, remained with her husband, to whom she\nconfided her feelings, and also the fact that she had not given him\nthe powder.\n\n\"I trust that you are mistaken, Amine,\" replied Philip, \"indeed I\nfeel sure that you must be. No man can be so bad as you suppose your\nfather.\"\n\n\"You have not lived with him as I have; you have not seen what I have\nseen,\" replied Amine. \"You know not what gold will tempt people to do\nin this world--but, however, I may be wrong. At all events, you must\ngo to sleep, and I shall watch you, dearest. Pray do not speak--I feel\nI cannot sleep just now--I wish to read a little--I will lie down\nby-and-bye.\"\n\nPhilip made no further objections, and was soon in a sound sleep, and\nAmine watched him in silence till midnight long had passed.\n\n\"He breathes heavily,\" thought Amine; \"but had I given him that\npowder, who knows if he had ever awoke again? My father is so deeply\nskilled in the Eastern knowledge, that I fear him. Too often has he,\nI well know, for a purse well filled with gold, prepared the sleep of\ndeath. Another would shudder at the thought; but he, who has dealt out\ndeath at the will of his employers, would scruple little to do so even\nto the husband of his own daughter; and I have watched him in his\nmoods, and know his thoughts and wishes. What a foreboding of mishap\nhas come over me this evening!--what a fear of evil! Philip is ill,\n'tis true, but not so very ill. No! no! besides, his time is not yet\ncome; he has his dreadful task to finish. I would it were morning. How\nsoundly he sleeps! and the dew is on his brow. I must cover him\nup warm, and watch that he remains so. Some one knocks at the\nentrance-door. Now will they wake him. 'Tis a summons for my father.\"\n\nAmine left the room, and hastened downstairs. It was, as she supposed,\na summons for Mynheer Poots to a woman taken in labour.\n\n\"He shall follow you directly,\" said Amine; \"I will now call him up.\"\nAmine went upstairs to the room where her father slept, and knocked;\nhearing no answer, as usual, she knocked again.\n\n\"My father is not used to sleep in this way,\" thought Amine, when she\nfound no answer to her second call. She opened the door and went in.\nTo her surprise, her father was not in bed. \"Strange,\" thought she;\n\"but I do not recollect having heard his footsteps coming up after he\nwent down to take away the lights.\" And Amine hastened to the parlour,\nwhere, stretched on the sofa, she discovered her father apparently\nfast asleep; but to her call he gave no answer. \"Merciful Heaven! is\nhe dead?\" thought she, approaching the light to her father's face.\nYes, it was so! his eyes were fixed and glazed--his lower jaw had\nfallen.\n\nFor some minutes, Amine leant against the wall in a state of\nbewilderment; her brain whirled; at last she recovered herself.\n\n\"'Tis to be proved at once,\" thought she, as she went up to the table,\nand looked into the silver cup in which she had mixed the powder--it\nwas empty! \"The God of Righteousness hath punished him!\" exclaimed\nAmine; \"but, O! that this man should have been my father! Yes! it is\nplain. Frightened at his own wicked, damned intentions, he poured out\nmore wine from the flagon, to blunt his feelings of remorse; and not\nknowing that the powder was still in the cup, he filled it up, and\ndrank himself--the death he meant for another! For another!--and for\nwhom? one wedded to his own daughter!--Philip! my husband! Wert thou\nnot my father,\" continued Amine, looking at the dead body, \"I would\nspit upon thee, and curse thee! but thou art punished, and may God\nforgive thee! thou poor, weak, wicked creature!\"\n\nAmine then left the room, and went upstairs, where she found Philip\nstill fast asleep, and in a profuse perspiration. Most women would\nhave awakened their husbands, but Amine thought not of herself; Philip\nwas ill, and Amine would not arouse him to agitate him. She sat down\nby the side of the bed, and with her hands pressed upon her forehead,\nand her elbows resting on her knees, she remained in deep thought\nuntil the sun had risen and poured his bright beams through the\ncasement.\n\nShe was roused from her reflections by another summons at the door of\nthe cottage. She hastened down to the entrance, but did not open the\ndoor.\n\n\"Mynheer Poots is required immediately,\" said the girl, who was the\nmessenger.\n\n\"My good Therese,\" replied Amine, \"my father has more need of\nassistance than the poor woman; for his travail in this world, I fear,\nis well over. I found him very ill when I went to call him, and he\nhas not been able to quit his bed. I must now entreat you to do my\nmessage, and desire Father Seysen to come hither; for my poor father\nis, I fear, in extremity.\"\n\n\"Mercy on me!\" replied Therese. \"Is it so? Fear not but I will do your\nbidding, Mistress Amine.\"\n\nThe second knocking had awakened Philip, who felt that he was much\nbetter, and his headache had left him. He perceived that Amine had not\ntaken any rest that night, and he was about to expostulate with her,\nwhen she at once told him what had occurred.\n\n\"You must dress yourself, Philip,\" continued she, \"and must assist me\nto carry up his body, and place it in his bed, before the arrival of\nthe priest. God of mercy! had I given you that powder, my dearest\nPhilip--but let us not talk about it. Be quick, for Father Seysen will\nbe here soon.\"\n\nPhilip was soon dressed, and followed Amine down into the parlour. The\nsun shone bright, and his rays were darted upon the haggard face of\nthe old man, whose fists were clenched, and his tongue fixed between\nthe teeth on one side of his mouth.\n\n\"Alas! this room appears to be fatal. How many more scenes of horror\nare to pass within it?\"\n\n\"None, I trust,\" replied Amine; \"this is not, to my mind, the scene of\nhorror. It was when that old man (now called away--and a victim of his\nown treachery) stood by your bedside, and with every mark of interest\nand kindness, offered you the cup--_that_ was the scene of horror,\"\nsaid Amine, shuddering--\"one which long will haunt me.\"\n\n\"God forgive him! as I do,\" replied Philip, lifting up the body, and\ncarrying it up the stairs to the room which had been occupied by\nMynheer Poots.\n\n\"Let it at least be supposed that he died in his bed, and that his\ndeath was natural,\" said Amine. \"My pride cannot bear that this\nshould be known, or that I should be pointed at as the daughter of a\nmurderer! O Philip!\"\n\nAmine sat down, and burst into tears.\n\nHer husband was attempting to console her, when Father Seysen knocked\nat the door. Philip hastened down to open it.\n\n\"Good morning, my son. How is the sufferer?\"\n\n\"He has ceased to suffer, father.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" replied the good priest, with sorrow in his countenance; \"am\nI then too late? yet have I not tarried.\"\n\n\"He went off suddenly, father, in a convulsion,\" replied Philip,\nleading the way upstairs.\n\nFather Seysen looked at the body and perceived that his offices were\nneedless, and then turned to Amine, who had not yet checked her tears.\n\n\"Weep, my child, weep! for you have cause,\" said the priest. \"The\nloss of a father's love must be a severe trial to a dutiful and\naffectionate child. But yield not too much to your grief, Amine; you\nhave other duties, other ties, my child--you have your husband.\"\n\n\"I know it, father,\" replied Amine; \"still must I weep, for I was\n_his_ daughter.\"\n\n\"Did he not go to bed last night, then, that his clothes are still\nupon him? When did he first complain?\"\n\n\"The last time that I saw him, father,\" replied Philip, \"he came into\nmy room, and gave me some medicine, and then he wished me good-night.\nUpon a summons to attend a sick-bed, my wife went to call him, and\nfound him speechless.\"\n\n\"It has been sudden,\" replied the priest; \"but he was an old man, and\nold men sink at once. Were you with him when he died?\"\n\n\"I was not, sir,\" replied Philip; \"before my wife had summoned me and\nI had dressed myself, he had left this world.\"\n\n\"I trust, my children, for a better.\" Amine shuddered. \"Tell me,\nAmine,\" continued the priest, \"did he show signs of grace before\nhe died? for you know full well that he has long been looked on as\ndoubtful in his creed, and little attentive to the rites of our holy\nchurch.\"\n\n\"There are times, holy father,\" replied Amine, \"when even a sincere\nChristian can be excused, even if he give no sign. Look at his\nclenched hands, witness the agony of death on his face, and could you,\nin that state, expect a sign?\"\n\n\"Alas! 'tis but too true, my child; we must then hope for the best.\nKneel with me, my children, and let us offer up a prayer for the soul\nof the departed.\"\n\nPhilip and Amine knelt with the priest, who prayed fervently; and\nas they rose, they exchanged a glance which fully revealed what was\npassing in the mind of each.\n\n\"I will send the people to do their offices for the dead, and prepare\nthe body for interment,\" said Father Seysen; \"but it were as well not\nto say that he was dead before I arrived, or to let it be supposed\nthat he was called away without receiving the consolations of our holy\ncreed.\"\n\nPhilip motioned his head in assent as he stood at the foot of the\nbed, and the priest departed. There had always been a strong feeling\nagainst Mynheer Poots in the village;--his neglect of all religious\nduties--the doubt whether he was even a member of the church--his\navarice and extortion--had created for him a host of enemies; but, at\nthe same time, his great medical skill, which was fully acknowledged,\nrendered him of importance. Had it been known that his creed (if he\nhad any) was Mahometan, and that he had died in attempting to poison\nhis son-in-law, it is certain that Christian burial would have been\nrefused him, and the finger of scorn would have been pointed at his\ndaughter. But as Father Seysen, when questioned, said, in a mild\nvoice, that \"he had departed in peace,\" it was presumed that Mynheer\nPoots had died a good Christian, although he had acted little up to\nthe tenets of Christianity during his life. The next day the remains\nof the old man were consigned to the earth with the usual rites;\nand Philip and Amine were not a little relieved in their minds at\neverything having passed off so quietly.\n\nIt was not until after the funeral had taken place that Philip, in\ncompany with Amine, examined the chamber of his father-in-law. The\nkey of the iron chest was found in his pocket; but Philip had not yet\nlooked into this darling repository of the old man. The room was full\nof bottles and boxes of drugs, all of which were either thrown away,\nor, if the utility of them was known to Amine, removed to a spare\nroom. His table contained many drawers, which were now examined,\nand among the heterogeneous contents were many writings in\nArabic--probably prescriptions. Boxes and papers were also found, with\nArabic characters written upon them; and in the box which they first\ntook up was a powder similar to that which Mynheer Poots had given to\nAmine. There were many articles and writings which made it appear that\nthe old man had dabbled in the occult sciences, as they were practised\nat that period, and those they hastened to commit to the flames.\n\n\"Had all these been seen by Father Seysen!\" observed Amine,\nmournfully. \"But here are some printed papers, Philip!\"\n\nPhilip examined them, and found that they were acknowledgments of\nshares in the Dutch East India Company.\n\n\"No, Amine, these are money, or what is as good--these are eight\nshares in the Company's capital, which will yield us a handsome income\nevery year. I had no idea that the old man made such use of his money.\nI had some intention of doing the same with a part of mine before I\nwent away, instead of allowing it to remain idle.\"\n\nThe iron chest was now to be examined. When Philip first opened it, he\nimagined that it contained but little; for it was large and deep, and\nappeared to be almost empty; but when he put his hands down to the\nbottom, he pulled out thirty or forty small bags, the contents of\nwhich, instead of being silver guilders, were all coins of gold; there\nwas only one large bag of silver money. But this was not all: several\nsmall boxes and packets were also discovered, which, when opened, were\nfound to contain diamonds and other precious stones. When everything\nwas collected, the treasure appeared to be of great value.\n\n\"Amine, my love, you have indeed brought me an unexpected dower,\" said\nPhilip.\n\n\"You may well say _unexpected_\" replied Amine. \"These diamonds and\njewels my father must have brought with him from Egypt. And yet how\npenuriously we were living until we came to this cottage! And with all\nthis treasure he would have poisoned my Philip for more! God forgive\nhim!\"\n\nHaving counted the gold, which amounted to nearly fifty thousand\nguilders, the whole was replaced, and they left the room.\n\n\"I am a rich man,\" thought Philip, after Amine had left him; \"but\nof what use are riches to me? I might purchase a ship and be my own\ncaptain, but would not the ship be lost? That certainly does not\nfollow; but the chances are against the vessel; therefore I will have\nno ship. But is it right to sail in the vessels of others with this\nfeeling?--I know not; this, however, I know, that I have a duty to\nperform, and that all our lives are in the hands of a kind Providence,\nwhich calls us away when he thinks fit. I will place most of my money\nin the shares of the Company, and if I sail in their vessels, and they\ncome to misfortune by meeting with my poor father, at least I shall\nbe a common sufferer with the rest. And now to make my Amine more\ncomfortable.\"\n\nPhilip immediately made a great alteration in their style of living.\nTwo female servants were hired: the rooms were more comfortably\nfurnished; and in everything in which his wife's comfort and\nconvenience were concerned, he spared no expense. He wrote to\nAmsterdam and purchased several shares in the Company's stock. The\ndiamonds and his own money he still left in the hands of Amine. In\nmaking these arrangements the two months passed rapidly away, and\neverything was complete when Philip again received his summons, by\nletter, to desire that he would join his vessel. Amine would have\nwished Philip to go out as a passenger instead of going as an officer,\nbut Philip preferred the latter, as otherwise he could give no reason\nfor his voyage to India.\n\n\"I know not why,\" observed Philip, the evening before his departure,\n\"but I do not feel as I did when I last went away; I have no\nforeboding of evil this time.\"\n\n\"Nor have I,\" replied Amine; \"but I feel as if you would be long away\nfrom me, Philip; and is not that an evil to a fond and anxious wife?\"\n\n\"Yes, love, it is; but--\"\n\n\"O yes, I know it is your duty, and you must go,\" replied Amine,\nburying her face in his bosom.\n\nThe next day Philip parted from his wife, who behaved with more\nfortitude than on their first separation. \"_All_ were lost, but _he_\nwas saved,\" thought Amine. \"I feel that he will return to me. God of\nHeaven, thy will be done!\"\n\nPhilip soon arrived at Amsterdam; and having purchased many things\nwhich he thought might be advantageous to him in case of accident, to\nwhich he now looked forward as almost certain, he embarked on board\nthe _Batavia_, which was lying at single anchor, and ready for sea.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XII\n\n\nPhilip had not been long on board, ere he found that they were not\nlikely to have a very comfortable passage; for the _Batavia_ was\nchartered to convey a large detachment of troops to Ceylon and Java,\nfor the purpose of recruiting and strengthening the Company's forces\nat those places. She was to quit the fleet off Madagascar, and run\ndirect for the Island of Java; the number of soldiers on board being\npresumed sufficient to insure the ship against any attack or accidents\nfrom pirates or enemies' cruisers. The _Batavia_, moreover, mounted\nthirty guns, and had a crew of seventy-five men. Besides military\nstores, which formed the principal part of her cargo, she had on board\na large quantity of specie for the Indian market. The detachment of\nsoldiers was embarking when Philip went on board, and in a few minutes\nthe decks were so crowded that it was hardly possible to move. Philip,\nwho had not yet spoken to the captain, found out the first mate,\nand immediately entered upon his duty, with which, from his close\napplication to it during his former voyage and passage home, he was\nmuch better acquainted than might have been imagined.\n\nIn a short time all traces of hurry and confusion began to disappear,\nthe baggage of the troops was stowed away, and the soldiers having\nbeen told off in parties, and stationed with their messing utensils\nbetween the guns of the main deck, room was thus afforded for working\nthe ship. Philip showed great activity as well as method in the\narrangements proposed, and the captain, during a pause in his own\narduous duties, said to him--\n\n\"I thought you were taking it very easy, Mr Vanderdecken, in not\njoining the ship before, but, now you are on board, you are making up\nfor lost time. You have done more during the forenoon than I could\nhave expected. I am glad that you are come, though very sorry you were\nnot here when we were stowing the hold, which, I am afraid, is not\narranged quite so well as it might be. Mynheer Struys, the first mate,\nhas had more to do than he could well give attention to.\"\n\n\"I am sorry that I should not have been here, sir,\" replied Philip;\n\"but I came as soon as the Company sent me word.\"\n\n\"Yes, and as they know that you are a married man, and do not forget\nthat you are a great shareholder, they would not trouble you too soon.\nI presume you will have the command of a vessel next voyage. In fact,\nyou are certain of it, with the capital you have invested in their\nfunds. I had a conversation with one of the senior accountants on the\nsubject this very morning.\"\n\nPhilip was not very sorry that his money had been put out to such\ngood interest, as to be the captain of a ship was what he earnestly\ndesired. He replied, that, \"he certainly did hope to command a ship\nafter the next voyage, when he trusted that he should feel himself\nquite competent to the charge.\"\n\n\"No doubt, no doubt, Mr Vanderdecken. I can see that clearly. You must\nbe very fond of the sea.\"\n\n\"I am,\" replied Philip; \"I doubt whether I shall ever give it up.\"\n\n\"_Never_ give it up! You think so now. You are young, active, and full\nof hope: but you will tire of it by-and-bye, and be glad to lay by for\nthe rest of your days.\"\n\n\"How many troops do we embark?\" inquired Philip.\n\n\"Two hundred and forty-five rank and file, and six officers. Poor\nfellows! there are but few of them will ever return: nay, more than\none-half will not see another birthday. It is a dreadful climate. I\nhave landed three hundred men at that horrid hole, and in six months,\neven before I had sailed, there were not one hundred left alive.\"\n\n\"It is almost murder to send them there,\" observed Philip.\n\n\"Psha! they must die somewhere, and if they die a little sooner, what\nmatter? Life is a commodity to be bought and sold like any other. We\nsend so much manufactured goods and so much money to barter for Indian\ncommodities. We also send out so much life, and it gives a good return\nto the Company.\"\n\n\"But not to the poor soldiers, I am afraid.\"\n\n\"No; the Company buy it cheap and sell it dear,\" replied the captain,\nwho walked forward.\n\nTrue, thought Philip, they do purchase human life cheap, and make a\nrare profit of it, for without these poor fellows how could they hold\ntheir possessions in spite of native and foreign enemies? For what a\npaltry and cheap annuity do these men sell their lives? For what a\nmiserable pittance do they dare all the horrors of a most deadly\nclimate, without a chance, a hope of return to their native land,\nwhere they might haply repair their exhausted energies, and take a\nnew lease of life! Good God! if these men may be thus heartlessly\nsacrificed to Mammon, why should I feel remorse if, in the fulfilment\nof a sacred duty imposed on me by Him who deals with us as He thinks\nmeet, a few mortals perish? Not a sparrow falls to the ground without\nHis knowledge, and it is for Him to sacrifice or save. I am but the\ncreature of His will, and I but follow my duty,--but obey the commands\nof One whose ways are inscrutable. Still, if for my sake this ship\nbe also doomed, I cannot but wish that I had been appointed to some\nother, in which the waste of human life might have been less.\n\nIt was not until a week after Philip arrived on board that the\n_Batavia_ and the remainder of the fleet were ready for sea.\n\nIt would be difficult to analyse the feelings of Philip Vanderdecken\non this his second embarkation. His mind was so continually directed\nto the object of his voyage, that although he attended to his\nreligious duty, yet the business of life passed before him as a dream.\nAssured of again meeting with the Phantom Ship, and almost equally\nassured that the meeting would be followed by some untoward event, in\nall probability by the sacrifice of those who sailed with him, his\nthoughts preyed upon him, and wore him down to a shadow. He hardly\never spoke, except in the execution of his duty. He felt like a\ncriminal; as one who, by embarking with them, had doomed all around\nhim to death, disaster, and peril; and when _one_ talked of his\nwife, and _another_ of his children--when they would indulge in\nanticipations, and canvass happy projects, Philip would feel sick at\nheart, and would rise from the table and hasten to the solitude of the\ndeck. At one time he would try to persuade himself that his senses had\nbeen worked upon in some moment of excitement, that he was the victim\nof an illusion; at another he would call to mind all the past--he\nwould feel its terrible reality--and then the thought would suggest\nitself that with this supernatural vision Heaven had nothing to do;\nthat it was but the work and jugglery of Satan. But then the relic--by\nsuch means the devil would not have worked. A few days after he had\nsailed, he bitterly repented that he had not stated the whole of\nhis circumstances to Father Seysen, and taken his advice upon the\npropriety of following up his search; but it was now too late; already\nwas the good ship _Batavia_ more than a thousand miles from the port\nof Amsterdam, and his duty, whatever it might be, _must_ be fulfilled.\n\nAs the fleet approached the Cape, his anxiety increased to such a\ndegree that it was remarked by all who were on board. The captain and\nofficers commanding the troops embarked, who all felt interested in\nhim, vainly attempted to learn the cause of his anxiety. Philip would\nplead ill-health; and his haggard countenance and sunken eyes silently\nproved that he was under acute suffering. The major part of the night\nhe passed on deck, straining his eyes in every quarter, and watching\neach change in the horizon, in anticipation of the appearance of the\nPhantom Ship; and it was not till the day dawned that he sought a\nperturbed repose in his cabin. After a favourable passage, the fleet\nanchored to refresh at Table Bay, and Philip felt some small relief,\nthat up to the present time the supernatural visitation had not again\noccurred.\n\nAs soon as the fleet had watered, they again made sail, and again\ndid Philip's agitation become perceptible. With a favouring breeze,\nhowever, they rounded the Cape, passed by Madagascar, and arrived in\nthe Indian Seas, when the _Batavia_ parted company with the rest of\nthe fleet, which steered to Cambroon and Ceylon. \"And now,\" thought\nPhilip, \"will the Phantom Ship make her appearance. It has only waited\ntill we should be left without a consort to assist us in distress.\" But\nthe _Batavia_ sailed in a smooth sea and under a cloudless sky, and\nnothing was seen. In a few weeks she arrived off Java, and, previous\nto entering the splendid roads of Batavia, hove-to for the night. This\nwas the last night they would be under sail, and Philip stirred not\nfrom the deck, but walked to and fro, anxiously waiting for the\nmorning. The morning broke--the sun rose in splendour, and the\n_Batavia_ steered into the roads. Before noon she was at anchor, and\nPhilip, with his mind relieved, hastened down to his cabin, and took\nthat repose which he so much required.\n\nHe awoke refreshed, for a great weight had been taken off his mind.\n\"It does not follow, then,\" thought he, \"that because I am on board\nthe vessel therefore the crew are doomed to perish; it does not follow\nthat the Phantom Ship is to appear because I seek her. If so, I have\nno further weight upon my conscience. I seek her, it is true, and wish\nto meet with her; I stand, however, but the same chance as others; and\nit is no way certain that because I seek, I am sure to find. That she\nbrings disaster upon all she meets, may be true, but not that I bring\nwith me the disaster of meeting her. Heaven I thank thee! Now I can\nprosecute my search without remorse.\"\n\nPhilip, restored to composure by these reflections, went on deck. The\ndebarkation of the troops was already taking place, for they were as\nanxious to be relieved from their long confinement as the seamen were\nto regain a little space and comfort. He surveyed the scene. The town\nof Batavia lay about one mile from them, low on the beach; from behind\nit rose a lofty chain of mountains, brilliant with verdure, and, here\nand there, peopled with country seats, belonging to the residents,\ndelightfully embosomed in forests of trees. The panorama was\nbeautiful; the vegetation was luxuriant, and, from its vivid green,\nrefreshing to the eye. Near to the town lay large and small vessels,\na forest of masts; the water in the bay was of a bright blue, and\nrippled to a soft breeze; here and there small islets (like tufts of\nfresh verdure) broke the uniformity of the water-line; even the town\nitself was pleasing to the eye, the white colour of the houses being\nopposed to the dark foliage of the trees, which grew in the gardens,\nand lined the streets.\n\n\"Can it be possible,\" observed Philip to the captain of the _Batavia_,\nwho stood by him, \"that this beautiful spot can be so unhealthy? I\nshould form a very different opinion from its appearance.\"\n\n\"Even,\" replied the captain, \"as the venomous snakes of the country\nstart up from among its flowers, so does death stalk about in this\nbeautiful and luxuriant landscape. Do you feel better, Mynheer\nVanderdecken?\"\n\n\"Much better,\" replied Philip.\n\n\"Still, in your enfeebled state, I should recommend you to go on\nshore.\"\n\n\"I shall avail myself of your permission, with thanks. How long shall\nwe stay here?\"\n\n\"Not long, as we are ordered to run back. Our cargo is all ready for\nus, and will be on board soon after we have discharged.\"\n\nPhilip took the advice of his captain; he had no difficulty in finding\nhimself received by a hospitable merchant, who had a house at some\ndistance from the town, and in a healthy situation. There he remained\ntwo months, during which he re-established his health, and then\nre-embarked a few days previous to the ship being ready for sea. The\nreturn voyage was fortunate, and in four months from the date of their\nquitting Batavia, they found themselves abreast of St Helena; for\nvessels, at that period, generally made what is called the eastern\npassage, running down the coast of Africa, instead of keeping towards\nthe American shores. Again they had passed the Cape without meeting\nwith the Phantom Ship; and Philip was not only in excellent health,\nbut in good spirits. As they lay becalmed, with the island in sight,\nthey observed a boat pulling towards them, and in the course of three\nhours she arrived on board. The crew were much exhausted from having\nbeen two days in the boat, during which time they had never ceased\npulling to gain the island. They stated themselves to be the crew of a\nsmall Dutch Indiaman, which had foundered at sea two days before; she\nhad started one of her planks, and filled so rapidly that the men had\nhardly time to save themselves. They consisted of the captain, mates,\nand twenty men belonging to the ship, and an old Portuguese Catholic\npriest, who had been sent home by the Dutch governor, for having\nopposed the Dutch interests in the Island of Japan. He had lived with\nthe natives, and been secreted by them for some time, as the Japanese\ngovernment was equally desirous of capturing him, with the intention\nof taking away his life. Eventually he found himself obliged to throw\nhimself into the arms of the Dutch, as being the less cruel of his\nenemies.\n\nThe Dutch government decided that he should be sent away from the\ncountry; and he had, in consequence, been put on board of the Indiaman\nfor a passage home. By the report of the captain and crew, one person\nonly had been lost; but he was a person of consequence, having for\nmany years held the situation of president in the Dutch factory at\nJapan. He was returning to Holland with the riches which he had\namassed. By the evidence of the captain and crew, he had insisted,\nafter he was put into the boat, upon going back to the ship to secure\na casket of immense value, containing diamonds and other precious\nstones, which he had forgotten; they added, that while they were\nwaiting for him the ship suddenly plunged her bowsprit under, and\nwent down head foremost, and that it was with difficulty they had\nthemselves escaped. They had waited for some time to ascertain if he\nwould rise again to the surface, but he appeared no more.\n\n\"I knew that something would happen,\" observed the captain of the\nsunken vessel, after he had been sitting a short time in the cabin\nwith Philip and the captain of the _Batavia_; \"we saw the Fiend or\nDevil's Ship, as they call her, but three days before.\"\n\n\"What! the _Flying Dutchman_, as they name her?\" asked Philip.\n\n\"Yes; that, I believe, is the name they give her,\" replied the\ncaptain. \"I have often heard of her; but it never was my fate to fall\nin with her before, and I hope it never will be again; for I am a\nruined man, and must begin the world afresh.\"\n\n\"I have heard of that vessel,\" observed the captain of the _Batavia_.\n\"Pray, how did she appear to you?\"\n\n\"Why, the fact is, I did not see anything but the loom of her hull,\"\nreplied the other. \"It was very strange; the night was fine, and the\nheavens clear; we were under top-gallant sails, for I do not carry on\nduring the night, or else we might have put the royals on her; she\nwould have carried them with the breeze. I had turned in, when about\ntwo o'clock in the morning the mate called me to come on deck. I\ndemanded what was the matter, and he replied he could hardly tell, but\nthat the men were much frightened, and that there was a Ghost Ship, as\nthe sailors termed it, in sight. I went on deck; all the horizon was\nclear, but on our quarter was a sort of fog, round as a ball, and not\nmore than two cables' length from us. We were going about four knots\nand a half free, and yet we could not escape from this mist. 'Look\nthere,' said the mate. 'Why, what the devil can it be?' said I,\nrubbing my eyes. 'No banks up to windward, and yet a fog in the middle\nof a clear sky, with a fresh breeze, and with water all around it;'\nfor you see the fog did not cover more than a dozen cables' length, as\nwe could perceive by the horizon on each side of it. 'Hark, sir!'\nsaid the mate--'they are speaking again.' 'Speaking!' said I, and I\nlistened; and from out this ball of fog I heard voices. At last, one\ncried out, 'Keep a sharp look-out forward, d'ye hear?' 'Ay, ay, sir!'\nreplied another voice. 'Ship on the starboard bow, sir.' 'Very well;\nstrike the bell there forward.' And then we heard the bell toll. 'It\nmust be a vessel,' said I to the mate. 'Not of this world, sir,'\nreplied he. 'Hark!' 'A gun ready forward.' 'Ay, ay, sir!' was now\nheard out of the fog, which appeared to near us; 'all ready, sir.'\n'Fire!' The report of the gun sounded on our ears like thunder, and\nthen--\"\n\n\"Well, and then?\" said the captain of the _Batavia_, breathless.\n\n\"And then,\" replied the other captain, solemnly, \"the fog and all\ndisappeared as if by magic, the whole horizon was clear, and there was\nnothing to be seen.\"\n\n\"Is it possible?\"\n\n\"There are twenty men on deck to tell the story,\" replied the captain.\n\"And the old Catholic priest to boot, for he stood by me the whole\ntime I was on deck. The men said that some accident would happen; and\nin the morning watch, on sounding the well, we found four feet water.\nWe took to the pumps, but it gained upon us, and we went down, as I\nhave told you. The mate says that the vessel is well known--it is\ncalled the _Flying Dutchman_.\"\n\nPhilip made no remarks at the time, but he was much pleased at what\nhe had heard. \"If,\" thought he, \"the Phantom Ship of my poor father\nappears to others as well as to me, and they are sufferers, my being\non board can make no difference. I do but take my chance of falling\nin with her, and do not risk the lives of those who sail in the same\nvessel with me. Now my mind is relieved, and I can prosecute my search\nwith a quiet conscience.\"\n\nThe next day Philip took an opportunity of making the acquaintance of\nthe Catholic priest, who spoke Dutch and other languages as well as\nhe did Portuguese. He was a venerable old man, apparently about sixty\nyears of age, with a white flowing beard, mild in his demeanour, and\nvery pleasing in his conversation.\n\nWhen Philip kept his watch that night, the old man walked with him,\nand it was then, after a long conversation, that Philip confided to\nhim that he was of the Catholic persuasion.\n\n\"Indeed, my son, that is unusual in a Hollander.\"\n\n\"It is so,\" replied Philip; \"nor is it known on board--not that I am\nashamed of my religion, but I wish to avoid discussion.\"\n\n\"You are prudent, my son. Alas! if the reformed religion produces no\nbetter fruit than what I have witnessed in the East, it is little\nbetter than idolatry.\"\n\n\"Tell me, father,\" said Philip--\"they talk of a miraculous vision--of\na ship not manned by mortal men. Did you see it?\"\n\n\"I saw what others saw,\" replied the priest; \"and certainly, as far as\nmy senses would enable me to judge, the appearance was most unusual--I\nmay say supernatural; but I had heard of this Phantom Ship before, and\nmoreover that its appearance was the precursor of disaster. So did it\nprove in our case, although, indeed, we had one on board, now no more,\nwhose weight of guilt was more than sufficient to sink any vessel;\none, the swallowing up of whom, with all that wealth from which he\nanticipated such enjoyment in his own country, has manifested that\nthe Almighty will, even in this world, sometimes wreak just and awful\nretribution on those who have merited His vengeance.\"\n\n\"You refer to the Dutch President who went down with the ship when it\nsank.\"\n\n\"I do; but the tale of that man's crime is long; to-morrow night I\nwill walk with you, and narrate the whole. Peace be with you, my son,\nand good-night.\"\n\nThe weather continued fine, and the _Batavia_ hove-to in the evening\nwith the intention of anchoring the next morning in the roadstead of\nSt Helena. Philip, when he went on deck to keep the middle watch,\nfound the old priest at the gangway waiting for him. In the ship all\nwas quiet; the men slumbered between the guns, and Philip, with his\nnew acquaintance, went aft, and seating themselves on a hencoop, the\npriest commenced as follows:--\n\n\"You are not, perhaps, aware that the Portuguese, although anxious to\nsecure for themselves a country discovered by their enterprise and\ncourage, and the possession of which, I fear, has cost them many\ncrimes, have still never lost sight of one point dear to all good\nCatholics--that of spreading wide the true faith, and planting the\nbanner of Christ in the regions of idolatry. Some of our countrymen\nhaving been wrecked on the coast, we were made acquainted with the\nislands of Japan; and seven years afterwards, our holy and blessed St\nFrancis, now with God, landed on the Island of Ximo, where he remained\nfor two years and five months, during which he preached our religion\nand made many converts. He afterwards embarked for China, his original\ndestination, but was not permitted to arrive there; he died on his\npassage, and thus closed his pure and holy life. After his death,\nnotwithstanding the many obstacles thrown in our way by the priests of\nidolatry, and the persecutions with which they occasionally visited\nthe members of our faith, the converts to our holy religion increased\ngreatly in the Japanese islands. The religion spread fast, and many\nthousands worshipped the true God.\n\n\"After a time, the Dutch formed a settlement at Japan, and when they\nfound that the Japanese Christians around the factories would deal\nonly with the Portuguese, in whom they had confidence, they became our\nenemies; and the man of whom we have spoken, and who at that period\nwas the head of the Dutch Factory, determined, in his lust for gold,\nto make the Christian religion a source of suspicion to the emperor\nof the country, and thus to ruin the Portuguese and their adherents.\nSuch, my son, was the conduct of one who professed to have embraced\nthe reformed religion as being of greater purity than our own.\n\n\"There was a Japanese lord of great wealth and influence who lived\nnear us, and who, with two of his sons, had embraced Christianity, and\nhad been baptised. He had two other sons, who lived at the emperor's\ncourt. This lord had made us a present of a house for a college and\nschool of instruction: on his death, however, his two sons at court,\nwho were idolaters, insisted upon our quitting this property. We\nrefused, and thus afforded the Dutch principal an opportunity of\ninflaming these young noblemen against us: by this means he persuaded\nthe Japanese emperor that the Portuguese and Christians had formed a\nconspiracy against his life and throne; for, be it observed, that when\na Dutchman was asked if he was a Christian, he would reply, 'No; I am\na Hollander.'\n\n\"The emperor, believing in this conspiracy, gave an immediate order\nfor the extirpation of the Portuguese, and then of all the Japanese\nwho had embraced the Christian faith. He raised an army for this\npurpose, and gave the command of it to the young noblemen I have\nmentioned, the sons of the lord who had given us the college. The\nChristians, aware that resistance was their only chance, flew to arms,\nand chose as their generals the other two sons of the Japanese lord,\nwho, with their father, had embraced Christianity. Thus were the two\narmies commanded by four brothers, two on the one side and two on the\nother.\n\n\"The Christian army amounted to more than 40,000 men, but of this the\nemperor was not aware, and he sent a force of about 25,000 to conquer\nand exterminate them. The armies met, and after an obstinate combat\n(for the Japanese are very brave) the victory was on the part of the\nChristians, and, with the exception of a few who saved themselves in\nthe boats, the army of the emperor was cut to pieces.\n\n\"This victory was the occasion of making more converts, and our army\nwas soon increased to upwards of 50,000 men. On the other hand, the\nemperor, perceiving that his troops had been destroyed, ordered new\nlevies and raised a force of 150,000 men, giving directions to his\ngenerals to give no quarter to the Christians, with the exception\nof the two young lords who commanded them, whom he wished to secure\nalive, that he might put them to death by slow torture. All offers of\naccommodation were refused, and the emperor took the field in person.\nThe armies again met, and on the first day's battle the victory was on\nthe part of the Christians; still they had to lament the loss of one\nof their generals, who was wounded and taken prisoner, and, no quarter\nhaving been given, their loss was severe.\n\n\"The second day's combat was fatal to the Christians. Their general\nwas killed; they were overpowered by numbers, and fell to a man. The\nemperor then attacked the camp in the rear, and put to the sword every\nold man, woman, and child. On the field of battle, in the camp, and by\nsubsequent torture, more than 60,000 Christians perished. But this\nwas not all; a rigorous search for Christians was made throughout the\nislands for many years; and they were, when found, put to death by\nthe most cruel torture. It was not until fifteen years ago that\nChristianity was entirely rooted out of the Japanese empire, and\nduring a persecution of somewhat more than sixteen years, it is\nsupposed that upwards of 400,000 Christians were destroyed; and all\nthis slaughter, my son, was occasioned by the falsehood and avarice\nof that man who met his just punishment but a few days ago. The Dutch\ncompany, pleased with his conduct, which procured for them such\nadvantages, continued him for many years as the president of their\nfactory at Japan. He was a young man when he first went there, but his\nhair was grey when he thought of returning to his own country. He had\namassed immense wealth,--immense, indeed, must it have been to have\nsatisfied avarice such as his! All has now perished with him, and he\nhas been summoned to his account. Reflect a little, my son. Is it\nnot better to follow up our path of duty, to eschew the riches and\npleasures of this world, and, at our summons hence, to feel that we\nhave hopes of bliss hereafter?\"\n\n\"Most true, holy father,\" replied Philip, musing.\n\n\"I have but a few years to live,\" continued the old man, \"and God\nknows I shall quit this world without reluctance.\"\n\n\"And so could I,\" replied Philip.\n\n\"_You_, my son!--no. You are young, and should be full of hopes. You\nhave still to do your duty in that station to which it shall please\nGod to call you.\"\n\n\"I know that I have a duty to perform,\" replied Philip. \"Father, the\nnight air is too keen for one so aged as you. Retire to your bed, and\nleave me to my watch and my own thoughts.\"\n\n\"I will, my son! may Heaven guard you! Take an old man's blessing.\nGood-night.\"\n\n\"Good-night,\" replied Philip, glad to be alone. \"Shall I confess all\nto him?\" thought Philip. \"I feel I could confess to him.--But no. I\nwould not to Father Seysen,--why to him? I should put myself in his\npower, and he might order me--No, no! my secret is my own. I need no\nadvisers.\" And Philip pulled out the relic from his bosom, and put it\nreverently to his lips.\n\nThe _Batavia_ waited a few days at St Helena, and then continued her\nvoyage. In six weeks Philip again found himself at anchor in the\nZuyder Zee, and having the captain's permission, he immediately set\noff for his own home, taking with him the old Portuguese priest\nMathias, with whom he had formed a great intimacy, and to whom he had\noffered his protection for the time he might wish to remain in the Low\nCountries.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIII\n\n\n\"Far be it from me to wish to annoy you, my son,\" said Father Mathias,\nas with difficulty he kept pace with the rapid strides of Philip, who\nwas now within a quarter of a mile of his home; \"but still recollect\nthat this is but a transitory world, and that much time has elapsed\nsince you quitted this spot. For that reason I would fain desire you,\nif possible, to check these bounding aspirations after happiness,\nthese joyful anticipations in which you have indulged since we quitted\nthe vessel. I hope and trust in the mercy of God, that all will be\nright, and that in a few minutes you will be in the arms of your\nmuch-loved wife: but still, in proportion as you allow your hopes\nto be raised, so will you inevitably have them crushed should\ndisappointment cross your path. At Flushing we were told that there\nhas been a dreadful visitation in this land, and death may not have\nspared even one so young and fair.\"\n\n\"Let us haste on, father,\" replied Philip. \"What you say is true, and\nsuspense becomes most dreadful.\"\n\nPhilip increased his speed, leaving the old man to follow him: he\narrived at the bridge with its wooden gate. It was then about seven\no'clock in the morning, for they had crossed the Scheldt at the dawn\nof day.\n\nPhilip observed that the lower shutters were still closed.\n\n\"They might have been up and stirring before this,\" thought he, as he\nput his hand to the latch of the door. It was not fastened. Philip\nentered! there was a light burning in the kitchen; he pushed open\nthe door, and beheld a maid-servant leaning back in her chair in a\nprofound sleep. Before he had time to go in and awaken her, he heard a\nvoice at the top of the stairs, saying, \"Marie, is that the doctor?\"\n\nPhilip waited no longer; in three bounds he was on the landing-place\nabove, and brushing by the person who had spoken, he opened the door\nof Amine's room.\n\nA floating wick in a tumbler of oil gave but a faint and glimmering\nlight; the curtains of the bed were drawn, and by the side of it\nwas kneeling a figure that was well known to Philip--that of Father\nSeysen. Philip recoiled; the blood retreated to his heart; he could\nnot speak: panting for breath, he supported himself against the wall,\nand at last vented his agony of feeling by a deep groan, which aroused\nthe priest, who turned his head, and perceiving who it was, rose from\nhis knees, and extended his hand in silence.\n\n\"She is dead, then!\" at last exclaimed Philip.\n\n\"No, my son, not dead; there is yet hope. The crisis is at hand;\nin one more hour her fate will be decided: then either will she be\nrestored to your arms, or follow the many hundreds whom this fatal\nepidemic has consigned to the tomb.\"\n\nFather Seysen then led Philip to the side of the bed, and withdrew the\ncurtain. Amine lay insensible, but breathing heavily; her eyes were\nclosed. Philip seized her burning hand, knelt down, pressed it to his\nlips, and burst into a paroxysm of tears. As soon as he had become\nsomewhat composed, Father Seysen persuaded him to rise and sit with\nhim by the side of the bed.\n\n\"This is a melancholy sight to witness at your return, Philip,\" said\nhe; \"and to you who are so ardent, so impetuous, it must be doubly so;\nbut God's will be done. Remember there is yet hope--not strong hope, I\ngrant, but still there is hope, for so told me the medical man who has\nattended her, and who will return, I expect, in a few minutes. Her\ndisease is a typhus fever, which has swept off whole families within\nthese last two months, and still rages violently; fortunate, indeed,\nis the house which has to mourn but one victim. I would that you had\nnot arrived just now, for it is a disease easily communicated. Many\nhave fled from the country for security. To add to our misfortunes,\nwe have suffered from the want of medical advice, for physician and\npatient have been swept away together.\"\n\nThe door was now slowly opened, and a tall, dark man, in a brown\ncloak, holding to his nose a sponge saturated with vinegar, entered\nthe room. He bowed his head to Philip and the priest, and then went\nto the bedside. For a minute he held his fingers to the pulse of the\nsufferer, then laying down her arm, he put his hand to her forehead,\nand covered her up with the bedclothes. He handed to Philip the sponge\nand vinegar, making a sign that he should use it, and beckoned Father\nSeysen out of the room.\n\nIn a minute the priest returned. \"I have received his directions, my\nson; he thinks that she may be saved. The clothes must be kept on her,\nand replaced if she should throw them off; but everything will depend\nupon quiet and calm after she recovers her senses.\"\n\n\"Surely we can promise her that,\" replied Philip.\n\n\"It is not the knowledge of your return, or even the sight of you,\nwhich alarms me. Joy seldom kills, even when the shock is great, but\nthere are other causes for uneasiness.\"\n\n\"What are they, holy father?\"\n\n\"Philip, it is now thirteen days that Amine has raved, and during\nthat period I have seldom quitted her but to perform the duties of my\noffice to others who required it. I have been afraid to leave her,\nPhilip, for in her ravings she has told such a tale, even unconnected\nas it has been, as has thrilled my soul with horror. It evidently has\nlong lain heavily on her mind, and must retard her recovery. Philip\nVanderdecken, you may remember that I would once have had the secret\nfrom you--the secret which forced your mother to her tomb, and which\nnow may send your young wife to follow her, for it is evident that she\nknows all. Is it not true?\"\n\n\"She does know all,\" replied Philip, mournfully.\n\n\"And she has in her delirium told all. Nay, I trust she has told more\nthan all; but of that we will not speak now: watch her, Philip. I will\nreturn in half an hour, for by that time, the doctor tells me, the\nsymptoms will decide whether she will return to reason, or be lost to\nyou for ever.\"\n\nPhilip whispered to the priest that he had been accompanied by Father\nMathias, who was to remain as his guest, and requested him to explain\nthe circumstances of his present position to him, and see that he was\nattended to. Father Seysen then quitted the room, when Philip sat down\nby the bedside, and drew back the curtain.\n\nPerhaps there is no situation in life so agonising to the feelings\nas that in which Philip was now placed. His joyful emotions when\nexpecting to embrace in health and beauty the object of his warmest\naffections, and of his continual thought during his long absence,\nsuddenly checked by disappointment, anxiety, and grief, at finding\nher lying emaciated, changed, corrupted with disease--her mind\noverthrown--her eyes unconscious of his presence--her existence\nhanging by a single hair--her frame prostrate before the King of\nTerrors who hovers over her with uplifted dart, and longs for the fiat\nwhich should permit him to pierce his unconscious victim.\n\n\"Alas!\" thought Philip, \"is it thus we meet, Amine? Truly did Father\nMathias advise me, as I hurried so impetuously along, not (as I fondly\nthought) to happiness, but to misery. God of Heaven! be merciful and\nforgive me. If I have loved this angelic creature of Thy formation,\neven more than I have Thee--spare her--good Heaven, spare her--or I am\nlost for ever.\"\n\nPhilip covered up his face, and remained for some time in prayer. He\nthen bent over his Amine, and impressed a kiss upon her burning lips.\nThey were burning, but still there was moisture upon them, and Philip\nperceived that there was also moisture on her forehead. He felt her\nhand, and the palm of it was moist; and carefully covering her with\nthe bedclothes, he watched her with anxiety and hope.\n\nIn a quarter of an hour he had the delight of perceiving that Amine\nwas in a profuse perspiration; gradually her breathing became less\nheavy, and instead of the passive state in which she had remained, she\nmoved, and became restless. Philip watched, and replaced the clothes\nas she threw them off, until she at last appeared to have fallen into\na profound and sweet sleep. Shortly after, Father Seysen and the\nphysician made their appearance. Philip stated, in few words, what\nhad occurred. The doctor went to the bedside, and in half a minute\nreturned.\n\n\"Your wife is spared to you, Mynheer, but it is not advisable that she\nshould see you so unexpectedly; the shock may be too great in her\nweak state; she must be allowed to sleep as long as possible; on her\nawaking she will have returned to reason. You must leave her then to\nFather Seysen.\"\n\n\"May I not remain in the room until she wakes? I will then hasten away\nunobserved.\"\n\n\"That will be useless; the disease is contagious, and you have been\nhere too long already. Remain below; you must change your clothes, and\nsee that they prepare a bed for her in another room, to which she must\nbe transported as soon as you think she can bear it; and then\nlet these windows be thrown open, that the room may be properly\nventilated. It will not do to have a wife just rescued from the\njaws of death run the risk of falling a sacrifice to the attentions\nnecessary to a sick husband.\"\n\nPhilip perceived the prudence of this advice, and quitting the room\nwith the medical man, he went and changed his clothes, and then joined\nFather Mathias, whom he found in the parlour below.\n\n\"You were right, father,\" said Philip, throwing himself on the sofa.\n\n\"I am old and suspicious, you are young and buoyant, Philip; but I\ntrust all may yet be well.\"\n\n\"I trust so too,\" replied Philip. He then remained silent and absorbed\nin thought, for now that the imminent danger was over, he was\nreflecting upon what Father Seysen had communicated to him relative\nto Amine's having revealed the secret whilst in a state of mental\naberration. The priest perceiving that his mind was occupied, did not\ninterrupt him. An hour had thus passed, when Father Seysen entered the\nroom.\n\n\"Return thanks to Heaven, my son. Amine has awakened, and is perfectly\nsensible and collected. There is now little doubt of her recovery. She\nhas taken the restorative ordered by the doctor, though she was so\nanxious to repose once more, that she could hardly be persuaded to\nswallow it. She is now again fast asleep, and watched by one of the\nmaidens, and in all probability will not move for many hours; but\nevery moment of such sleep is precious, and she must not be disturbed.\nI will now see to some refreshment, which must be needful to us all.\nPhilip, you have not introduced me to your companion, who, I perceive,\nis of my own calling.\"\n\n\"Forgive me, sir,\" replied Philip; \"you will have great pleasure in\nmaking acquaintance with Father Mathias, who has promised to reside\nwith me, I trust, for some time. I will leave you together, and see to\nthe breakfast being prepared, for the delay of which I trust Father\nMathias will accept my apology.\"\n\nPhilip then left the room, and went into the kitchen. Having ordered\nwhat was requisite, to be taken into the parlour, he put on his hat\nand walked out of the house. He could not eat; his mind was in a state\nof confusion; the events of the morning had been too harassing and\nexciting, and he felt as if the fresh air was necessary to his\nexistence.\n\nAs he proceeded, careless in which direction, he met many with whom he\nhad been acquainted, and from whom he had received condolence at his\nsupposed bereavement, and congratulations when they learnt from him\nthat the danger was over; and from them he also learnt how fatal had\nbeen the pestilence.\n\nNot one-third of the inhabitants of Terneuse and the surrounding\ncountry remained alive, and those who had recovered were in a state\nof exhaustion which prevented them from returning to their accustomed\noccupations. They had combated disease, but remained the prey of\nmisery and want; and Philip mentally vowed that he would appropriate\nall his savings to the relief of those around him. It was not until\nmore than two hours had passed away that Philip returned to the\ncottage.\n\nOn his arrival he found that Amine still slumbered, and the two\npriests were in conversation below.\n\n\"My son,\" said Father Seysen, \"let us now have a little explanation.\nI have had a long conference with this good Father, who hath much\ninterested me with his account of the extension of our holy religion\namong the Pagans. He hath communicated to me much to rejoice at and\nmuch to grieve for; but, among other questions put to him, I have (in\nconsequence of what I have learnt during the mental alienation of your\nwife) interrogated him upon the point of a supernatural appearance of\na vessel in the eastern seas. You observe, Philip, that your secret is\nknown to me, or I could not have put that question. To my surprise, he\nhath stated a visitation of the kind to which he was eye-witness,\nand which cannot reasonably be accounted for, except by supernatural\ninterposition. A strange and certainly most awful visitation! Philip,\nwould it not be better (instead of leaving me in a maze of doubt) that\nyou now confided to us both all the facts connected with this strange\nhistory, so that we may ponder on them, and give you the benefit of\nthe advice of those who are older than yourself, and who, by their\ncalling may be able to decide more correctly whether this supernatural\npower has been exercised by a good or evil intelligence?\"\n\n\"The holy Father speaks well, Philip Vanderdecken,\" observed Mathias.\n\n\"If it be the work of the Almighty, to whom should you confide and by\nwhom should you be guided, but by those who do His service on this\nearth? If of the Evil One, to whom but to those whose duty and wish it\nis to counteract his baneful influence? And reflect, Philip, that this\nsecret may sit heavily on the mind of your cherished wife, and may bow\nher to the grave, as it did your (I trust) sainted mother. With you,\nand supported by your presence, she may bear it well; but, recollect\nhow many are the lonely days and nights that she must pass during your\nabsence, and how much she must require the consolation and help of\nothers. A secret like this must be as a gnawing worm, and, strong as\nshe may be in courage, must shorten her existence, but for the support\nand the balm she may receive from the ministers of our faith. It was\ncruel and selfish of you, Philip, to leave her, a lone woman, to bear\nup against your absence, and at the same time oppressed with so fatal\na knowledge.\"\n\n\"You have convinced me, holy Father,\" replied Philip. \"I feel that\nI should, before this, have made you acquainted with this strange\nhistory. I will now state the whole of the circumstances which have\noccurred, but with little hope your advice can help me, in a case so\ndifficult, and in a duty so peremptory, yet so perplexing.\"\n\nPhilip then entered into a minute detail of all that had passed from\nthe few days previous to his mother's death, until the present time,\nand when he had concluded, he observed--\n\n\"You see, Father, that I have bound myself by a solemn vow--that that\nvow has been recorded and accepted; and it appears to me that I have\nnothing now to do but to follow my peculiar destiny.\"\n\n\"My son, you have told us strange and startling things--things not of\nthis world--if you are not deceived. Leave us now. Father Mathias and\nI will consult upon this serious matter, and when we are agreed, you\nshall know our decision.\"\n\nPhilip went upstairs to see Amine; she was still in a deep sleep: he\ndismissed the servant, and watched by the bedside. For nearly two\nhours did he remain there, when he was summoned down to meet the two\npriests.\n\n\"We have had a long conversation, my son,\" said Father Seysen, \"upon\nthis strange, and perhaps supernatural occurrence. I say _perhaps_,\nfor I would have rejected the frenzied communications of your mother,\nas the imaginings of a heated brain; and for the same reason I\nshould have been equally inclined to suppose that the high state\nof excitement that you were in at the time of her death may have\ndisordered your intellect; but, as Father Mathias positively asserts,\nthat a strange, if not supernatural, appearance of a vessel did take\nplace, on his passage home, and which appearance tallies with and\ncorroborates the legend, if so I may call it, to which you have\ngiven evidence; I say that it is not impossible but that it is\nsupernatural.\"\n\n\"Recollect that the same appearance of the Phantom Ship has been\npermitted to me and to many others,\" replied Philip.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Father Seysen; \"but who is there alive of those who saw\nit but yourself? But that is of little importance. We will admit\nthat the whole affair is not the work of man, but of a superior\nintelligence.\"\n\n\"Superior, indeed!\" replied Philip. \"It is the work of Heaven!\"\n\n\"That is a point not so easily admitted; there is another power as\nwell as that which is divine--that of the devil!--the arch-enemy of\nmankind! But as that power, inferior to the power of God, cannot act\nwithout His permission, we may indirectly admit that it is the will of\nHeaven that such signs and portents should be allowed to be given on\ncertain occasions.\"\n\n\"Then our opinions are the same, good Father.\"\n\n\"Nay, not exactly, my son. Elymas, the sorcerer, was permitted to\npractise his arts--gained from the devil--that it might be proved, by\nhis overthrow and blindness, how inferior was his master to the Divine\nRuler; but it does not therefore follow that sorcery generally was\npermitted. In this instance it may be true that the Evil One has been\npermitted to exercise his power over the captain and crew of that\nship, and, as a warning against such heavy offences, the supernatural\nappearance of the vessel may be permitted. So far we are justifiable\nin believing. But the great questions are, first, whether it be your\nfather who is thus doomed? and, secondly, how far you are necessitated\nto follow up this mad pursuit, which, it appears to me--although it\nmay end in your destruction--cannot possibly be the means of rescuing\nyour father from his state of unhallowed abeyance? Do you understand\nme, Philip?\"\n\n\"I certainly understand what you would say, Father; but--\"\n\n\"Answer me not yet. It is the opinion of this holy father as well\nas of myself, that, allowing the facts to be as you suppose, the\nrevelations made to you are not from on high, but the suggestions of\nthe devil, to lead you into danger and ultimately to death; for if it\nwere your task, as you suppose, why did not the vessel appear on this\nlast voyage, and how can you (allowing that you met her fifty times)\nhave communication with that, or with those which are but phantoms and\nshadows, things not of this world? Now what we propose is, that you\nshould spend a proportion of the money left by your father, in masses\nfor the repose of his soul, which your mother, in other circumstances,\nwould certainly have done; and that having so done, you should remain\nquietly on shore until some new sign should be given to you which may\nwarrant our supposing that you are really chosen for this strange\npursuit?\"\n\n\"But my oath, Father--my recorded vow?\"\n\n\"From that, my son, the holy Church hath power to absolve you; and\nthat absolution you shall receive. You have put yourself into our\nhands, and by our decision you must be guided. If there be wrong, it\nis we, and not you, who are responsible; but, at present, let us say\nno more. I will now go up, and so soon as your wife awakens, prepare\nher for your meeting.\"\n\nWhen Father Seysen had quitted the room, Father Mathias debated\nthe matter with Philip. A long discussion ensued, in which similar\narguments were made use of by the priest; and Philip, although not\nconvinced, was, at least, doubtful and perplexed. He left the cottage.\n\n\"A new sign--a corroborative sign,\" thought Philip; \"surely there have\nbeen signs and wonders enough. Still it may be true that masses for\nmy father's soul may relieve him from his state of torture. At all\nevents, if they decide for me, I am not to blame. Well then, let us\nwait for a new sign of the Divine will--if so it must be;\" and Philip\nwalked on, occasionally thinking on the arguments of Father Seysen,\nand oftener thinking of Amine.\n\nIt was now evening, and the sun was fast descending. Philip wandered\non, until at last he arrived at the very spot where he had knelt down\nand pronounced his solemn vow. He recognised it; he looked at the\ndistant hills. The sun was just at the same height; the whole scene,\nthe place, and the time were before him. Again Philip knelt down, took\nthe relic from his bosom and kissed it. He watched the sun; he bowed\nhimself to the earth. He waited for a sign; but the sun sank down and\nthe veil of night spread over the landscape. There was no sign; and\nPhilip rose and walked home towards the cottage, more inclined than\nbefore to follow the suggestions of Father Seysen.\n\nOn his return, Philip went softly upstairs and entered the room of\nAmine, whom he found awake and in conversation with the priests. The\ncurtain was closed, and he was not perceived. With a beating heart he\nremained near the wall at the head of the bed.\n\n\"Reason to believe that my husband has arrived!\" said Amine, in a\nfaint voice. \"Oh tell me, why so?\"\n\n\"His ship is arrived, we know; and one who had seen her said that all\nwere well.\"\n\n\"And why is he not here, then? Who should bring the news of his return\nbut himself? Father Seysen, either he has not arrived or he is here--I\nknow he must be, if he is safe and well. I know my Philip too well.\nSay! is he not here? Fear not, if you say yes; but if you say no, you\nkill me!\"\n\n\"He is here, Amine,\" replied Father Seysen--\"here and well.\"\n\n\"O God! I thank you; but where is he? If he is here, he must be in\nthis room, or else you deceive me. Oh, this suspense is death!\"\n\n\"I am here,\" cried Philip, opening the curtains.\n\nAmine rose with a shriek, held out her arms, and then fell senseless\nback. In a few seconds, however, she was restored, and proved the\ntruth of the good Father's assertion, \"that joy does not kill.\"\n\nWe must now pass over the few days during which Philip watched the\ncouch of his Amine, who rapidly regained her strength. As soon as she\nwas well enough to enter upon the subject, Philip narrated all that\nhad passed since his departure; the confession which he had made to\nFather Seysen, and the result. Amine, too glad that Philip should\nremain with her, added her persuasions to those of the priests, and,\nfor some little time, Philip talked no more of going to sea.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIV\n\n\nSix weeks had flown away, and Amine, restored to health, wandered over\nthe country, hanging on the arm of her adored Philip, or nestled by\nhis side in their comfortable home. Father Mathias still remained\ntheir guest; the masses for the repose of the soul of Vanderdecken had\nbeen paid for, and more money had been confided to the care of Father\nSeysen to relieve the sufferings of the afflicted poor. It may be\neasily supposed that one of the chief topics of conversation between\nPhilip and Amine was the decision of the two priests relative to the\nconduct of Philip. He had been absolved from his oath, but, at the\nsame time that he submitted to his clerical advisers, he was by no\nmeans satisfied. His love for Amine, her wishes for his remaining\nat home, certainly added weight to the fiat of Father Seysen; but,\nalthough he in consequence obeyed it more willingly, his doubts of the\npropriety of his conduct remained the same. The arguments of Amine,\nwho, now that she was supported by the opinion of the priests, had\nbecome opposed to Philip's departure; even her caresses, with which\nthose arguments were mingled, were effective but for the moment. No\nsooner was Philip left to himself, no sooner was the question, for\na time, dismissed, than he felt an inward accusation that he was\nneglecting a sacred duty. Amine perceived how often the cloud was\nupon his brow; she knew too well the cause, and constantly did she\nrecommence her arguments and caresses, until Philip forgot that there\nwas aught but Amine in the world.\n\nOne morning, as they were seated upon a green bank picking the flowers\nthat blossomed round them, and tossing them away in pure listlessness,\nAmine took the opportunity that she had often waited for, to enter\nupon a subject hitherto unmentioned.\n\n\"Philip,\" said she, \"do you believe in dreams? think you that we may\nhave supernatural communications by such means?\"\n\n\"Of course we may,\" replied Philip; \"we have proof abundant of it in\nthe holy writings.\"\n\n\"Why, then, do you not satisfy your scruples by a dream?\"\n\n\"My dearest Amine, dreams come unbidden; we cannot command or prevent\nthem--\"\n\n\"We can command them, Philip; say that you would dream upon the\nsubject nearest to your heart, and you _shall_!\"\n\n\"I shall?\"\n\n\"Yes! I have that power, Philip, although I have not spoken of it.\nI had it from my mother, with much more that of late I have never\nthought of. You know, Philip, I never say that which is not. I tell\nyou, that, if you choose, you shall dream upon it.\"\n\n\"And to what good, Amine? If you have power to make me dream, that\npower must be from somewhere.\"\n\n\"It is, of course: there are agencies you little think of, which, in\nmy country, are still called into use. I have a charm, Philip, which\nnever fails.\"\n\n\"A charm, Amine! do you, then, deal in sorcery? for such powers cannot\nbe from Heaven.\"\n\n\"I cannot tell. I only know the power is given.\"\n\n\"It must be from the devil, Amine.\"\n\n\"And why so, Philip? May I not use the argument of your own priests,\nwho say, 'that the power of the devil is only permitted to be used\nby Divine intelligence, and that it cannot be used without that\npermission?' Allow it then to be sorcery, or what you please, unless\nby Heaven permitted, it would fail. But I cannot see why we should\nsuppose that it is from an evil source. We ask for a warning in a\ndream to guide our conduct in doubtful circumstances. Surely the evil\none would rather lead us wrong than right!\"\n\n\"Amine, we may be warned in a dream, as the patriarchs were of old;\nbut to use mystic or unholy charms to procure a vision, is making a\ncompact with the devil.\"\n\n\"Which compact the devil could not fulfil if not permitted by a higher\npower. Philip, your reasoning is false. We are told that, by certain\nmeans, duly observed, we may procure the dreams we wish. Our\nobservance of these means is certainly the least we can attend to, to\nprove our sincerity. Forgive me, Philip, but are not observances as\nnecessary in your religion--which I have embraced? Are we not told\nthat the omission of the mere ceremony of water to the infant will\nturn all future chance of happiness to misery eternal?\"\n\nPhilip answered not for some time. \"I am afraid, Amine,\" said he, at\nlast, in a low tone; \"I--\"\n\n\"I fear nothing, Philip, when my intentions are good,\" replied Amine.\n\"I follow certain means to obtain an end. What is that end? It is\nto find out (if possible) what may be the will of Heaven in this\nperplexing case. If it should be through the agency of the devil--what\nthen? He becomes my servant, and not my master; he is permitted by\nHeaven to act against himself;\" and Amine's eyes darted fire, as she\nthus boldly expressed herself.\n\n\"Did your mother often exercise her art?\" inquired Philip, after a\npause.\n\n\"Not to my knowledge; but it was said that she was most expert. She\ndied young (as you know), or I should have known much more. Think\nyou, Philip, that this world is solely peopled by such dross as\nwe are?--things of clay--perishable and corruptible? Lords over\nbeasts--and ourselves but little better. Have you not, from your\nown sacred writings, repeated acknowledgments and proofs of higher\nintelligences mixing up with mankind, and acting here below? Why\nshould what was then, not be now! and what more harm is there to apply\nfor their aid now, than a few thousand years ago? Why should you\nsuppose that they were permitted on the earth then--and not permitted\nnow? What has become of them? Have they perished? have they been\nordered back--to where--to heaven? If to heaven--the world and mankind\nhave been left to the mercy of the devil and his agents. Do you\nsuppose that we, poor mortals, have been thus abandoned? I tell you\nplainly, I think not. We no longer have the communications with\nthose intelligences that we once had, because, as we become more\nenlightened, we become more proud, and seek them not; but that they\nstill exist--a host of good against a host of evil, invisibly opposing\neach other--is my conviction. But, tell me, Philip, do you in your\nconscience believe that all that has been revealed to you is a mere\ndream of the imagination?\"\n\n\"I do not believe so, Amine: you know well I wish I could.\"\n\n\"Then is my reasoning proved: for if such communications can be made\nto you, why cannot others? You cannot tell by what agency; your\npriests say it is that of the evil one; you think it is from on high.\nBy the same rule, who is to decide from whence the dream shall come?\"\n\n\"'Tis true, Amine; but are you certain of your power?\"\n\n\"Certain of this: that if it pleases superior intelligence to\ncommunicate with you, _that_ communication may be relied upon. Either\nyou will not dream, but pass away the hours in deep sleep, or what you\ndream will be connected with the question at issue.\"\n\n\"Then, Amine, I have made up my mind--I will dream: for at present\nmy mind is racked by contending and perplexing doubts. I would know\nwhether I am right or wrong. This night your art shall be employed.\"\n\n\"Not this night, nor yet to-morrow night, Philip. Think you one moment\nthat, in proposing this, I serve you against my own wishes? I feel as\nif the dream will decide against me, and that you will be commanded\nto return to your duty; for I tell you honestly, I think not with the\npriests; but I am your wife, Philip, and it is my duty that you should\nnot be deceived. Having the means, as I suppose, to decide your\nconduct, I offer them. Promise me that, if I do this, you will grant\nme a favour which I shall ask as my reward.\"\n\n\"It is promised, Amine, without its being known,\" replied Philip,\nrising from the turf; \"and now let us go home.\"\n\nWe observed that Philip, previous to his sailing in the _Batavia_, had\ninvested a large proportion of his funds in Dutch East India stock:\nthe interest of the money was more than sufficient for the wants of\nAmine, and, on his return, he found that the funds left in her charge\nhad accumulated. After paying to Father Seysen the sums for the\nmasses, and for the relief of the poor, there was a considerable\nresidue, and Philip had employed this in the purchase of more shares\nin the India stock.\n\nThe subject of their conversation was not renewed. Philip was rather\naverse to Amine practising those mystical arts, which, if known to the\npriests, would have obtained for her, in all probability, the anathema\nof the Church. He could not but admire the boldness and power of\nAmine's reasonings, but still he was averse to reduce them into\npractice. The third day had passed away, and no more had been said\nupon the subject.\n\nPhilip retired to bed, and was soon fast asleep; but Amine slept not.\nSo soon as she was convinced that Philip would not be awakened, she\nslipped from the bed and dressed herself. She left the room, and in a\nquarter of an hour returned, bringing in her hand a small brazier of\nlighted charcoal, and two small pieces of parchment, rolled up and\nfixed by a knot to the centre of a narrow fillet. They exactly\nresembled the philacteries that were once worn by the Jewish nation,\nand were similarly applied. One of them she gently bound upon the\nforehead of her husband, and the other upon his left arm. She threw\nperfumes into the brazier, and as the form of her husband was becoming\nindistinct from the smoke which filled the room, she muttered a few\nsentences, waved over him a small sprig of some shrub which she held\nin her white hand, and then closing the curtains, and removing the\nbrazier she sat down by the side of the bed.\n\n\"If there be harm,\" thought Amine, \"at least the deed is not his--'tis\nmine; they cannot say that he has practised arts that are unlawful\nand forbidden by his priests. On my head be it!\" And there was a\ncontemptuous curl on Amine's beautiful arched lip, which did not say\nmuch for her devotion to her new creed.\n\nMorning dawned, and Philip still slumbered. \"'Tis enough,\" said Amine,\nwho had been watching the rising of the sun, as she beheld his upper\nlimb appear above the horizon. Again she waved her arm over Philip,\nholding the sprig in her hand; and cried, \"Philip, awake!\"\n\nPhilip started up, opened his eyes, and shut them again to avoid the\nglare of the broad daylight, rested upon his elbow, and appeared to be\ncollecting his thoughts.\n\n\"Where am I?\" exclaimed he. \"In my own bed? Yes!\" He passed his hand\nacross his forehead, and felt the scroll. \"What is this?\" continued\nhe, pulling it off, and examining it. \"And Amine, where is she? Good\nHeavens, what a dream! Another?\" cried he, perceiving the scroll tied\nto his arm. \"I see it now. Amine, this is your doing.\" And Philip\nthrew himself down, and buried his face in the pillow.\n\nAmine, in the meantime, had slipped into bed, and had taken her place\nby Philip's side. \"Sleep, Philip, dear! sleep!\" said she, putting her\narms round him; \"we will talk when we wake again.\"\n\n\"Are you there, Amine?\" replied Philip, confused. \"I thought I was\nalone; I have dreamed--\" And Philip again was fast asleep before\nhe could complete his sentence. Amine, too, tired with watching,\nslumbered and was happy.\n\nFather Mathias had to wait a long while for his breakfast that\nmorning; it was not till two hours later than usual that Philip and\nAmine made their appearance.\n\n\"Welcome, my children,\" said he; \"you are late.\"\n\n\"We are, Father,\" replied Amine; \"for Philip slept, and I watched till\nbreak of day.\"\n\n\"He hath not been ill, I trust,\" replied the priest.\n\n\"No, not ill; but I could not sleep,\" replied Amine.\n\n\"Then didst thou do well to pass the night--as I doubt not thou hast\ndone, my child--in holy watchings.\"\n\nPhilip shuddered; he knew that the watching, had its cause been known,\nwould have been, in the priest's opinion, anything but holy. Amine\nquickly replied--\n\n\"I have, indeed, communed with higher powers, as far as my poor\nintellect hath been able.\"\n\n\"The blessing of our holy Church upon thee, my child!\" said the old\nman, putting his hand upon her head; \"and on thee too, Philip.\"\n\nPhilip, confused, sat down to the table; Amine was collected as ever.\nShe spoke little, it is true, and appeared to commune with her own\nthoughts.\n\nAs soon as the repast was finished, the old priest took up his\nbreviary, and Amine beckoning to Philip, they went out together. They\nwalked in silence until they arrived at the green spot where Amine had\nfirst proposed to him that she should use her mystic power. She sat\ndown, and Philip, fully aware of her purpose, took his seat by her in\nsilence.\n\n\"Philip,\" said Amine, taking his hand, and looking earnestly in his\nface, \"last night you dreamed.\"\n\n\"I did, indeed, Amine,\" replied Philip, gravely.\n\n\"Tell me your dream; for it will be for me to expound it.\"\n\n\"I fear it needs but little exposition, Amine. All I would know is,\nfrom what intelligence the dream has been received?\"\n\n\"Tell me your dream,\" replied Amine, calmly.\n\n\"I thought,\" replied Philip, mournfully, \"that I was sailing as\ncaptain of a vessel round the Cape: the sea was calm and the breeze\nlight; I was abaft; the sun went down, and the stars were more than\nusually brilliant; the weather was warm, and I lay down on my cloak,\nwith my face to the heavens, watching the gems twinkling in the sky\nand the occasionally falling meteors. I thought that I fell asleep,\nand awoke with a sensation as if sinking down. I looked around me; the\nmasts, the rigging, the hull of the vessel--_all_ had disappeared, and\nI was floating by myself upon a large, beautifully shaped shell on the\nwide waste of waters. I was alarmed, and afraid to move, lest I should\noverturn my frail bark and perish. At last, I perceived the fore-part\nof the shell pressed down, as if a weight were hanging to it; and\nsoon afterwards a small white hand, which grasped it. I remained\nmotionless, and would have called out that my little bark would sink,\nbut I could not. Gradually a figure raised itself from the waters, and\nleaned with both arms over the fore-part of the shell, where I first\nhad seen but the hand. It was a female, in form beautiful to excess;\nthe skin was white as driven snow; her long loose hair covered her,\nand the ends floated in the water; her arms were rounded and like\nivory: she said, in a soft sweet voice--\n\n\"'Philip Vanderdecken, what do you fear? Have you not a charmed life?'\n\n\"'I know not,' replied I, 'whether my life be charmed or not; but this\nI know, that it is in danger.'\n\n\"'In danger!' replied she; 'it might have been in danger when you were\ntrusting to the frail works of men, which the waves love to rend to\nfragments--your _good_ ships, as you call them, which but float about\nupon sufferance; but where can be the danger when in a mermaid's\nshell, which the mountain wave respects, and upon which the cresting\nsurge dare not throw its spray? Philip Vanderdecken, you have come to\nseek your father?'\n\n\"'I have,' replied I; 'is it not the will of Heaven?'\n\n\"'It is your destiny--and destiny rules all above and below. Shall we\nseek him together? This shell is mine; you know not how to navigate\nit; shall I assist you?'\n\n\"'Will it bear us both?'\n\n\"'You will see,\" replied she, laughing, as she sank down from the\nfore-part of the shell, and immediately afterwards appeared at the\nside, which was not more than three inches above the water. To my\nalarm, she raised herself up, and sat upon the edge, but her weight\nappeared to have no effect. As soon as she was seated in this way--for\nher feet still remained in the water--the shell moved rapidly along,\nand each moment increased its speed, with no other propelling power\nthan that of her volition.\n\n\"'Do you fear now, Philip Vanderdecken?'\n\n\"'No!' replied I.\n\n\"She passed her hands across her forehead, threw aside the tresses\nwhich had partly concealed her face, and said--\n\n\"'Then look at me.'\n\n\"I looked, Amine, and I beheld you!\"\n\n\"Me!\" observed Amine, with a smile upon her lips.\n\n\"Yes, Amine, it was you. I called you by your name, and threw my arms\nround you. I felt that I could remain with you and sail about the\nworld for ever.\"\n\n\"Proceed, Philip,\" said Amine, calmly.\n\n\"I thought we ran thousands and thousands of miles--we passed by\nbeautiful islands, set like gems on the ocean bed; at one time\nbounding against the rippling current, at others close to the\nshore--skimming on the murmuring wave which rippled on the sand,\nwhilst the cocoa-tree on the beach waved to the cooling breeze.\"\n\n\"'It is not in smooth seas that your father must be sought,' said she,\n'we must try elsewhere.'\n\n\"By degrees the waves rose, until at last they were raging in their\nfury, and the shell was tossed by the tumultuous waters; but still not\na drop entered, and we sailed in security over billows which would\nhave swallowed up the proudest vessel.\n\n\"'Do you fear now, Philip?' said you to me.\n\n\"'No,' replied I; 'with you, Amine, I fear nothing.'\n\n\"'We are now off the Cape again,' said she; 'and here you may find\nyour father. Let us look well round us, for if we meet a ship it must\nbe _his_. None but the Phantom Ship could swim in a gale like this.'\n\n\"Away we flew over the mountainous waves--skimming from crest to crest\nbetween them, our little bark sometimes wholly out of the water;\nnow east, now west, north, south, in every quarter of the compass,\nchanging our course each minute. We passed over hundreds of miles: at\nlast we saw a vessel, tossed by the furious gale.\n\n\"'There,' cried she, pointing with her finger, 'there is your father's\nvessel, Philip.'\n\n\"Rapidly did we approach--they saw us from on board, and brought\nthe vessel to the wind. We were alongside--the gangway was clearing\naway--for though no boat could have boarded, our shell was safe. I\nlooked up. I saw my father, Amine! Yes, saw him, and heard him as he\ngave his orders. I pulled the relic from my bosom, and held it out\nto him. He smiled, as he stood on the gunnel, holding on by the main\nshrouds. I was just rising to mount on board, for they had handed to\nme the man-ropes, when there was a loud yell, and a man jumped from\nthe gangway into the shell. You shrieked, slipped from the side, and\ndisappeared under the wave, and in a moment the shell, guided by the\nman who had taken your place, flew away from the vessel with the\nrapidity of thought. I felt a deadly chill pervade my frame. I turned\nround to look at my new companion--it was the Pilot Schriften!--the\none-eyed wretch who was drowned when we were wrecked in Table Bay!\n\n\"'No! no! not yet!' cried he.\n\n\"In an agony of despair and rage I hurled him off his seat on the\nshell, and he floated on the wild waters.\n\n\"'Philip Vanderdecken,' said he, as he swam, 'we shall meet again!'\n\n\"I turned away my head in disgust, when a wave filled my bark, and\ndown it sank. I was struggling under the water, sinking still deeper\nand deeper, but without pain, when I awoke.\n\n\"Now, Amine,\" said Philip, after a pause, \"what think you of my\ndream?\"\n\n\"Does it not point out that I am your friend, Philip, and that the\nPilot Schriften is your enemy?\"\n\n\"I grant it; but he is dead.\"\n\n\"Is that so certain?\"\n\n\"He hardly could have escaped without my knowledge.\"\n\n\"That is true, but the dream would imply otherwise. Philip, it is\nmy opinion that the only way in which this dream is to be expounded\nis--that you remain on shore for the present. The advice is that of\nthe priests. In either case you require some further intimation. In\nyour dream, _I_ was your safe guide--be guided now by me again.\"\n\n\"Be it so, Amine. If your strange art be in opposition to our holy\nfaith, you expound the dream in conformity with the advice of its\nministers.\"\n\n\"I do. And now, Philip, let us dismiss the subject from our thoughts.\nShould the time come, your Amine will not persuade you from your duty;\nbut recollect, you have promised to grant _one_ favour when I ask it.\"\n\n\"I have: say, then, Amine, what may be your wish?\"\n\n\"O! nothing at present. I have no wish on earth but what is gratified.\nHave I not you, dear Philip?\" replied Amine, fondly throwing herself\non her husband's shoulder.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XV\n\nIt was about three months after this conversation that Amine and\nPhilip were again seated upon the mossy bank which we have mentioned,\nand which had become their favourite resort. Father Mathias had\ncontracted a great intimacy with Father Seysen, and the two priests\nwere almost as inseparable as were Philip and Amine. Having determined\nto wait a summons previous to Philip's again entering upon his strange\nand fearful task; and, happy in the possession of each other, the\nsubject was seldom revived. Philip, who had, on his return, expressed\nhis wish to the Directors of the Company for immediate employment,\nand, if possible, to have the command of a vessel, had, since that\nperiod, taken no further steps, nor had any communication with\nAmsterdam.\n\n\"I am fond of this bank, Philip,\" said Amine; \"I appear to have formed\nan intimacy with it. It was here, if you recollect, that we debated\nthe subject of the lawfulness of inducing dreams; and it was here,\ndear Philip, that you told me your dream, and that I expounded it.\"\n\n\"You did so, Amine; but if you ask the opinion of Father Seysen, you\nwill find that he would give rather a strong decision against you--he\nwould call it heretical and damnable.\"\n\n\"Let him, if he pleases. I have no objection to tell him.\"\n\n\"I pray not, Amine; let the secret remain with ourselves only.\"\n\n\"Think you Father Mathias would blame me?\"\n\n\"I certainly do.\"\n\n\"Well, I do not; there is a kindness and liberality about the old man\nthat I admire. I should like to argue the question with him.\"\n\nAs Amine spoke, Philip felt something touch his shoulder, and a sudden\nchill ran through his frame. In a moment his ideas reverted to the\nprobable cause: he turned round his head, and, to his amazement,\nbeheld the (supposed to be drowned) mate of the _Ter Schilling_, the\none-eyed Schriften, who stood behind him, with a letter in his hand.\nThe sudden appearance of this malignant wretch induced Philip to\nexclaim, \"Merciful heaven! is it possible?\"\n\nAmine, who had turned her head round at the exclamation of Philip,\ncovered up her face, and burst into tears. It was not fear that caused\nthis unusual emotion on her part, but the conviction that her husband\nwas never to be at rest but in the grave.\n\n\"Philip Vanderdecken,\" said Schriften, \"he! he! I've a letter for\nyou--it is from the Company.\"\n\nPhilip took the letter, but, previous to opening it, he fixed his eyes\nupon Schriften. \"I thought,\" said he, \"that you were drowned when the\nship was wrecked in False Bay. How did you escape?\"\n\n\"How did I escape?\" replied Schriften. \"Allow me to ask how did you\nescape?\"\n\n\"I was thrown up by the waves,\" replied Philip; \"but--\"\n\n\"But,\" interrupted Schriften, \"he! he! the waves ought _not_ to have\nthrown me up.\"\n\n\"And why not, pray? I did not say that.\"\n\n\"No! but I presume you wish it had been so; but, on the contrary,\nI escaped in the same way that you did--I was thrown up by the\nwaves--he! he! but I can't wait here. I have done my bidding.\"\n\n\"Stop,\" replied Philip; answer me one question. \"Do you sail in the\nsame vessel with me this time?\"\n\n\"I'd rather be excused,\" replied Schriften; \"I am not looking for the\nPhantom Ship, Mynheer Vanderdecken;\" and, with this reply, the little\nman turned round and went away at a rapid pace.\n\n\"Is not this a summons, Amine?\" said Philip, after a pause, still\nholding the letter in his hand, with the seal unbroken.\n\n\"I will not deny it, dearest Philip. It is most surely so; the hateful\nmessenger appears to have risen from the grave that he might deliver\nit. Forgive me, Philip; but I was taken by surprise. I will not again\nannoy you with a woman's weakness.\"\n\n\"My poor Amine,\" replied Philip, mournfully. \"Alas! why did I not\nperform my pilgrimage alone? It was selfish of me to link you with\nso much wretchedness, and join you with me in bearing the fardel of\nnever-ending anxiety and suspense.\"\n\n\"And who should bear it with you, my dearest Philip, if it is not the\nwife of your bosom? You little know my heart if you think I shrink\nfrom the duty. No, Philip, it is a pleasure, even in its most acute\npangs; for I consider that I am, by partaking with, relieving you of a\nportion of your sorrow, and I feel proud that I am the wife of one who\nhas been selected to be so peculiarly tried. But, dearest, no more of\nthis. You must read the letter.\"\n\nPhilip did not answer. He broke the seal, and found that the letter\nintimated to him that he was appointed as first mate to the _Vrow\nKaterina_, a vessel which sailed with the next fleet; and requesting\nhe would join as quickly as possible, as she would soon be ready to\nreceive her cargo. The letter which was from the secretary, further\ninformed him that, after this voyage, he might be certain of having\nthe command of a vessel as captain, upon conditions which would be\nexplained when he called upon the Board.\n\n\"I thought, Philip, that you had requested the command of a vessel for\nthis voyage,\" observed Amine, mournfully.\n\n\"I did,\" replied Philip; \"but not having followed up my application,\nit appears not to have been attended to. It has been my own fault.\"\n\n\"And now it is too late?\"\n\n\"Yes, dearest, most assuredly so: but it matters not; I would as\nwillingly, perhaps rather, sail this voyage as first mate.\"\n\n\"Philip, I may as well speak now. That I am disappointed, I must\nconfess; I fully expected that you would have had the command of a\nvessel, and you may remember that I exacted a promise from you, on\nthis very bank upon which we now sit, at the time that you told me\nyour dream. That promise I shall still exact, and I now tell you what\nI had intended to ask. It was, my dear Philip, permission to sail\nwith you. With you, I care for nothing. I can be happy under every\nprivation or danger; but to be left alone for so long, brooding over\nmy painful thoughts, devoured by suspense, impatient, restless, and\nincapable of applying to any one thing--that, dear Philip, is the\nheight of misery, and that is what I feel when you are absent.\nRecollect, I have your promise, Philip. As captain, you have the means\nof receiving your wife on board. I am bitterly disappointed in being\nleft this time; do, therefore, to a certain degree, console me by\npromising that I shall sail with you next voyage, if Heaven permit\nyour return.\"\n\n\"I promise it, Amine, since you are so earnest. I can refuse you\nnothing; but I have a foreboding that yours and my happiness will be\nwrecked for ever. I am not a visionary, but it does appear to me that,\nstrangely mixed up as I am, at once with this world and the next, some\nlittle portion of futurity is opened to me. I have given my promise,\nAmine, but from it I would fain be released.\"\n\n\"And if ill _do_ come, Philip, it is our destiny. Who can avert fate?\"\n\n\"Amine, we are free agents, and to a certain extent are permitted to\ndirect our own destinies.\"\n\n\"Ay, so would Father Seysen fain have made me believe; but what he\nsaid in support of his assertion was to me incomprehensible. And yet\nhe said that it was a part of the Catholic faith. It may be so--I am\nunable to understand many other points. I wish your faith were made\nmore simple. As yet the good man--for good he really is--has only led\nme into doubt.\"\n\n\"Passing through doubt, you will arrive at conviction, Amine.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so,\" replied Amine; \"but it appears to me that I am as yet\nbut on the outset of my journey. But come, Philip, let us return. You\nmust to Amsterdam, and I will go with you. After your labours of the\nday, at least until you sail, your Amine's smiles must still enliven\nyou. Is it not so?\"\n\n\"Yes, dearest, I would have proposed it. I wonder much how Schriften\ncould come here. I did not see his body it is certain, but his escape\nis to me miraculous. Why did he not appear when saved? where could he\nhave been? What think you, Amine?\"\n\n\"What I have long thought, Philip. He is a ghoul with an evil eye,\npermitted for some cause to walk the earth in human form; and, is,\ncertainly, in some way, connected with your strange destiny. If it\nrequires anything to convince me of the truth of all that has passed,\nit is his appearance--the wretched Afrit! Oh, that I had my mother's\npowers!--but I forget; it displeases you, Philip, that I ever talk of\nsuch things, and I am silent.\"\n\nPhilip replied not; and absorbed in their own meditations they walked\nback in silence to the cottage. Although Philip had made up his own\nmind, he immediately sent the Portuguese priest to summon Father\nSeysen, that he might communicate with them and take their opinion as\nto the summons he had received. Having entered into a fresh detail of\nthe supposed death of Schriften, and his reappearance as a messenger,\nhe then left the two priests to consult together, and went upstairs to\nAmine. It was more than two hours before Philip was called down, and\nFather Seysen appeared to be in a state of great perplexity.\n\n\"My son,\" said he, \"we are much perplexed. We had hoped that our ideas\nupon this strange communication were correct, and that, allowing all\nthat you have obtained from your mother and have seen yourself to have\nbeen no deception, still that it was the work of the evil one; and, if\nso, our prayers and masses would have destroyed this power. We advised\nyou to wait another summons, and you have received it. The letter\nitself is of course nothing, but the reappearance of the bearer of the\nletter is the question to be considered. Tell me, Philip, what is your\nopinion on this point? It is possible he might have been saved--why\nnot as well as yourself?\"\n\n\"I acknowledge the possibility, Father,\" replied Philip; \"he may have\nbeen cast on shore and have wandered in another direction. It is\npossible, although anything but probable; but since you ask me\nmy opinion, I must say candidly that I consider he is no earthly\nmessenger--nay, I am sure of it. That he is mysteriously connected\nwith my destiny is certain. But who he is, and what he is, of course I\ncannot tell.\"\n\n\"Then, my son, we have come to the determination, in this instance,\nnot to advise. You must act now upon your own responsibility and your\nown judgment. In what way soever you may decide we shall not blame\nyou. Our prayers shall be that Heaven may still have you in its holy\nkeeping.\"\n\n\"My decision, holy Father, is to obey the summons.\"\n\n\"Be it so, my son; something may occur which may assist to work\nout the mystery,--a mystery which I acknowledge to be beyond my\ncomprehension, and of too painful a nature for me to dwell upon.\"\n\nPhilip said no more, for he perceived that the priest was not at all\ninclined to converse. Father Mathias took this opportunity of thanking\nPhilip for his hospitality and kindness, and stated his intention of\nreturning to Lisbon by the first opportunity that might offer.\n\nIn a few days Amine and Philip took leave of the priests, and quitted\nfor Amsterdam--Father Seysen taking charge of the cottage until\nAmine's return. On his arrival, Philip called upon the Directors of\nthe Company, who promised him a ship on his return from the voyage he\nwas about to enter upon, making a condition that he should become part\nowner of the vessel. To this Philip consented, and then went down to\nvisit the _Vrow Katerina_, the ship to which he had been appointed as\nfirst mate. She was still unrigged, and the fleet was not expected\nto sail for two months. Only part of the crew were on board, and the\ncaptain, who lived at Dort, had not yet arrived.\n\nSo far as Philip could judge, the _Vrow Katerina_ was a very inferior\nvessel; she was larger than many of the others, but old, and badly\nconstructed; nevertheless, as she had been several voyages to the\nIndies, and had returned in safety, it was to be presumed that she\nwould not have been taken up by the Company if they had not been\nsatisfied as to her seaworthiness. Having given a few directions to\nthe men who were on board, Philip returned to the hostelry where he\nhad secured apartments for himself and Amine.\n\nThe next day, as Philip was superintending the fitting of the rigging,\nthe captain of the _Vrow Katerina_ arrived, and, stepping on board of\nher by the plank which communicated with the quay, the first thing\nthat he did was to run to the mainmast and embrace it with both arms,\nalthough there was no small portion of tallow on it to smear the cloth\nof his coat. \"Oh; my dear Vrow, my Katerina!\" cried he, as if he were\nspeaking to a female. \"How do you do? I'm glad to see you again; you\nhave been quite well, I hope? You do not like being laid up in this\nway. Never mind, my dear creature! you shall soon be handsome again.\"\n\nThe name of this personage who thus made love to his vessel, was\nWilhelm Barentz. He was a young man, apparently not thirty years of\nage, of diminutive stature and delicate proportions. His face was\nhandsome, but womanish. His movements were rapid and restless, and\nthere was that appearance in his eye which would have warranted the\nsupposition that he was a little flighty, even if his conduct had not\nfully proved the fact.\n\nNo sooner were the ecstacies of the captain over than Philip\nintroduced himself to him, and informed him of his appointment. \"Oh!\nyou are the first mate of the _Vrow Katerina_. Sir, you are a very\nfortunate man. Next to being captain of her, first mate is the most\nenviable situation in the world.\"\n\n\"Certainly not on account of her beauty,\" observed Philip; \"she may\nhave many other good qualities.\"\n\n\"Not on account of her beauty! Why, sir, I say (as my father has said\nbefore me, and it was his Vrow before it was mine) that she is the\nhandsomest vessel in the world. At present you cannot judge; and\nbesides being the handsomest vessel, she has every good quality under\nthe sun.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear it, sir,\" replied Philip; \"it proves that one\nshould never judge by appearances. But is she not very old?\"\n\n\"Old! not more than twenty-eight years--just in her prime. Stop, my\ndear sir, till you see her dancing on the waters, and then you will do\nnothing all day but discourse with me upon her excellence, and I have\nno doubt that we shall have a very happy time together.\"\n\n\"Provided the subject be not exhausted,\" replied Philip.\n\n\"That it never will be, on my part: and, allow me to observe, Mr\nVanderdecken, that any officer who finds fault with the _Vrow\nKaterina_ quarrels with me. I am her knight, and I have already fought\nthree men in her defence,--I trust, I shall not have to fight a\nfourth.\"\n\nPhilip smiled: he thought that she was not worth fighting for; but\nhe acted upon the suggestion, and, from that time forward, he never\nventured to express an opinion against the beautiful _Vrow Katerina_.\n\nThe crew were soon complete, the vessel rigged, her sails bent,\nand she was anchored in the stream, surrounded by the other ships\ncomposing the fleet about to be despatched. The cargo was then\nreceived on board, and, as soon as her hold was full, there came, to\nPhilip's great vexation, an order to receive on board 150 soldiers and\nother passengers, many of whom were accompanied by their wives and\nfamilies. Philip worked hard, for the captain did nothing but praise\nthe vessel, and, at last, they had embarked everything, and the fleet\nwas ready to sail.\n\nIt was now time to part with Amine, who had remained at the hostelry,\nand to whom Philip had dedicated every spare moment that he could\nobtain. The fleet was expected to sail in two days, and it was\ndecided, that on the morrow they should part. Amine was cool and\ncollected. She felt convinced that she should see her husband again,\nand with that feeling, she embraced him as they separated on the\nbeach, and he stepped into the boat in which he was to be pulled on\nboard.\n\n\"Yes,\" thought Amine, as she watched the form of her husband, as the\ndistance between them increased--\"yes, I know that we shall meet\nagain. It is not this voyage which is to be fatal to you or me; but I\nhave a dark foreboding that the next, in which I shall join you, will\nseparate us for ever--in which way, I know not--but it is destined.\nThe priests talk of free-will. Is it free-will which takes him away\nfrom me? Would he not rather remain on shore with me? Yes. But he is\nnot permitted, for he must fulfil his destiny. Free-will! Why, if it\nwere not destiny it were tyranny. I feel, and have felt, as if these\npriests are my enemies; but why I know not: they are both good men,\nand the creed they teach is good. Good-will and charity, love to all,\nforgiveness of injuries, not judging others. All this is good; and yet\nmy heart whispers to me that--but the boat is alongside, and Philip\nis climbing up the vessel. Farewell, farewell, my dearest husband. I\nwould I were a man! No, no! 'tis better as it is.\"\n\nAmine watched till she could no longer perceive Philip, and then\nwalked slowly to the hostelry. The next day, when she arose, she found\nthat the fleet had sailed at daylight, and the channel, which had been\nso crowded with vessels, was now untenanted.\n\n\"He is gone,\" muttered Amine; \"now for many months of patient, calm\nenduring,--I cannot say of living, for I exist but in his presence.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVI\n\n\nWe must leave Amine to her solitude, and follow the fortunes of\nPhilip. The fleet had sailed with a flowing sheet, and bore gallantly\ndown the Zuyder Zee; but they had not been under way an hour before\nthe _Vrow Katerina_ was left a mile or two astern. Mynheer Barentz\nfound fault with the setting and trimming of the sails, and with the\nman at the helm, who was repeatedly changed; in short, with everything\nbut his dear _Vrow Katerina_: but all would not do; she still dropped\nastern, and proved to be the worst-sailing vessel in the fleet.\n\n\"Mynheer Vanderdecken,\" said he, at last, \"the _Vrow_, as my father\nused to say, is not so very _fast before_ the wind. Vessels that are\ngood on a wind seldom are: but this I will say, that, in every other\npoint of sailing, there is no other vessel in the fleet equal to the\n_Vrow Katerina_.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" observed Philip, who perceived how anxious his captain was\non the subject, \"we are heavily laden, and have so many troops on\ndeck.\"\n\nThe fleet cleared the sands and were then close-hauled, when the _Vrow\nKaterina_ proved to sail even more slowly than before.\n\n\"When we are so _very_ close-hauled,\" observed Mynheer Barentz, \"the\n_Vrow_ does not do so well; but a point free, and then you will see\nhow she will show her stern to the whole fleet. She is a fine vessel,\nMynheer Vanderdecken, is she not?\"\n\n\"A very fine, roomy vessel,\" replied Philip, which was all that, in\nconscience, he could say.\n\nThe fleet sailed on, sometimes on a wind, sometimes free, but let the\npoint of sailing be what it might, the _Vrow Katerina_ was invariably\nastern, and the fleet had to heave-to at sunset to enable her to keep\ncompany; still, the captain continued to declare that the point of\nsailing on which they happened to be, was the only point in which the\n_Vrow Katerina_ was deficient. Unfortunately, the vessel had other\npoints quite as bad as her sailing; she was crank, leaky, and did not\nanswer the helm well: but Mynheer Barentz was not to be convinced. He\nadored his ship, and, like all men desperately in love, he could\nsee no fault in his mistress. But others were not so blind, and the\nadmiral, finding the voyage so much delayed by the bad sailing of one\nvessel, determined to leave her to find her way by herself so soon\nas they had passed the Cape. He was, however, spared the cruelty of\ndeserting her, for a heavy gale came on which dispersed the whole\nfleet, and on the second day the good ship _Vrow Katerina_ found\nherself alone, labouring heavily in the trough of the sea, leaking so\nmuch as to require hands constantly at the pumps, and drifting before\nthe gale as fast to leeward almost as she usually sailed. For a\nweek the gale continued, and each day did her situation become more\nalarming. Crowded with troops, encumbered with heavy stores, she\ngroaned and laboured, while whole seas washed over her, and the men\ncould hardly stand at the pumps. Philip was active, and exerted\nhimself to the utmost, encouraging the worn-out men, securing where\naught had given way, and little interfered with by the captain, who\nwas himself no sailor.\n\n\"Well,\" observed the captain to Philip, as they held on by the\nbelaying-pins, \"you'll acknowledge that she is a fine weatherly vessel\nin a gale--is she not? Softly, my beauty, softly,\" continued he,\nspeaking to the vessel, as she plunged heavily into the waves, and\nevery timber groaned. \"Softly, my dear, softly! How those poor\ndevils in the other ships must be knocking about now. Heh! Mynheer\nVanderdecken, we have the start of them this time: they must be a\nterrible long way down to leeward. Don't you think so?\"\n\n\"I really cannot pretend to say,\" replied Philip, smiling.\n\n\"Why, there's not one of them in sight. Yes, by Heavens, there is!\nLook on our lee beam. I see one now. Well, she must be a capital\nsailor at all events: look there, a point abaft the beam. Mercy on me!\nhow stiff she must be to carry such a press of canvas!\"\n\nPhilip had already seen her. It was a large ship on a wind, and on the\nsame tack as they were. In a gale in which no vessel could carry the\ntopsails, the _Vrow Katerina_ being under close-reefed foresails and\nstaysails, the ship seen to leeward was standing under a press of\nsail--top-gallant-sail, royals, flying-jib, and every stitch of canvas\nwhich could be set in a light breeze. The waves were running mountains\nhigh, bearing each minute the _Vrow Katerina_ down to the gunwale: and\nthe ship seen appeared not to be affected by the tumultuous waters,\nbut sailed steadily and smoothly on an even keel. At once Philip knew\nit must be the Phantom Ship, in which his father's doom was being\nfulfilled.\n\n\"Very odd, is it not?\" observed Mynheer Barentz.\n\nPhilip felt such an oppression on his chest that he could not reply.\nAs he held on with one hand, he covered up his eyes with the other.\n\nBut the seamen had now seen the vessel, and the legend was too well\nknown. Many of the troops had climbed on deck when the report was\ncirculated, and all eyes were now fixed upon the supernatural vessel;\nwhen a heavy squall burst over the _Vrow Katerina_, accompanied with\npeals of thunder and heavy rain, rendering it so thick that nothing\ncould be seen. In a quarter of an hour it cleared away, and, when they\nlooked to leeward, the stranger was no longer in sight.\n\n\"Merciful Heaven! she must have been upset, and has gone down in the\nsquall,\" said Mynheer Barentz. \"I thought as much, carrying such a\npress of sail. There never was a ship that could carry more than the\n_Vrow Katerina_. It was madness on the part of the captain of that\nvessel; but I suppose he wished to keep up with us. Heh, Mynheer\nVanderdecken?\"\n\nPhilip did not reply to these remarks, which fully proved the madness\nof his captain. He felt that his ship was doomed, and when he thought\nof the numbers on board who might be sacrificed, he shuddered. After a\npause, he said--\n\n\"Mynheer Barentz, this gale is likely to continue, and the best ship\nthat ever was built cannot, in my opinion, stand such weather. I\nshould advise that we bear up, and run back to Table Bay to refit.\nDepend upon it, we shall find the whole fleet there before us.\"\n\n\"Never fear for the good ship, _Vrow Katerina_,\" replied the captain;\n\"see what weather she makes of it.\"\n\n\"Cursed bad,\" observed one of the seamen, for the seamen had gathered\nnear to Philip to hear what his advice might be. \"If I had known that\nshe was such an old, crazy beast, I never would have trusted myself on\nboard. Mynheer Vanderdecken is right; we must back to Table Bay ere\nworse befall us. That ship to leeward has given us warning--she is not\nseen for nothing,--ask Mr Vanderdecken, captain; he knows that well,\nfor he _is_ a sailor.\"\n\nThis appeal to Philip made him start; it was, however, made without\nany knowledge of Philip's interest in the Phantom Ship.\n\n\"I must say,\" replied Philip, \"that, whenever I have fallen in with\nthat vessel, mischief has ever followed.\"\n\n\"Vessel! why, what was there in that vessel to frighten you? She\ncarried too much sail, and she has gone down.\"\n\n\"She never goes down,\" replied one of the seamen.\n\n\"No! no!\" exclaimed many voices; \"but we shall, if we do not run\nback.\"\n\n\"Pooh! nonsense! Mynheer Vanderdecken, what say you?\"\n\n\"I have already stated my opinion,\" replied Philip, who was anxious,\nif possible, to see the ship once more in port, \"that the best thing\nwe can do, is to bear up for Table Bay.\"\n\n\"And, captain,\" continued the old seaman who had just spoken, \"we are\nall determined that it shall be so, whether you like it or not; so\nup with the helm, my hearty, and Mynheer Vanderdecken will trim the\nsails.\"\n\n\"Why! what is this?\" cried Captain Barentz. \"A mutiny on board of the\n_Vrow Katerina_? Impossible! The _Vrow Katerina_ the best ship, the\nfastest in the whole fleet!\"\n\n\"The dullest old rotten tub,\" cried one of the seamen.\n\n\"What!\" cried the captain, \"what do I hear? Mynheer Vanderdecken,\nconfine that lying rascal for mutiny.\"\n\n\"Pooh! nonsense! he's mad,\" replied the old seaman. \"Never mind him;\ncome, Mynheer Vanderdecken, we will obey you; but the helm must be up\nimmediately.\"\n\nThe captain stormed, but Philip, by acknowledging the superiority\nof his vessel, at the same time that he blamed the seamen for their\npanic, pointed out to him the necessity of compliance, and Mynheer\nBarentz at last consented. The helm was put up, the sails trimmed,\nand the _Vrow Katerina_ rolled heavily before the gale. Towards the\nevening the weather moderated, and the sky cleared up; both sea and\nwind subsided fast; the leaking decreased, and Philip was in hopes\nthat in a day or two they would arrive safely in the Bay.\n\nAs they steered their course, so did the wind gradually decrease,\nuntil, at last, it fell calm; nothing remained of the tempest but a\nlong heavy swell which set to the westward, and before which the _Vrow\nKaterina_ was gradually drifting. This was a respite to the worn-out\nseamen, and also to the troops and passengers, who had been cooped\nbelow or drenched on the main-deck.\n\nThe upper deck was crowded; mothers basked in the warm sun with their\nchildren in their arms; the rigging was filled with the wet clothes,\nwhich were hung up to dry on every part of the shrouds; and the seamen\nwere busily employed in repairing the injuries of the gale. By their\nreckoning, they were not more than fifty miles from Table Bay, and\neach moment they expected to see the land to the southward of it. All\nwas again mirth, and everyone on board, except Philip, considered that\ndanger was no more to be apprehended.\n\nThe second mate, whose name was Krantz, was an active, good seaman,\nand a great favourite with Philip, who knew that he could trust to\nhim, and it was on the afternoon of this day that he and Philip were\nwalking together on the deck.\n\n\"What think you, Vanderdecken, of the strange vessel we saw?\"\n\n\"I have seen her before, Krantz; and--\"\n\n\"And what?\"\n\n\"Whatever vessel I have been in when I have seen her, that vessel has\nnever returned into port--others tell the same tale.\"\n\n\"Is she, then, the ghost of a vessel?\"\n\n\"I am told so; and there are various stories afloat concerning her:\nbut of this, I assure you--that I am fully persuaded than some\naccident will happen before we reach port, although everything, at\nthis moment, appears so calm, and our port is so near at hand.\"\n\n\"You are superstitious,\" replied Krantz; \"and yet I must say that, to\nme, the appearance was not like a reality. No vessel could carry such\nsail in the gale; but yet, there are madmen afloat who will sometimes\nattempt the most absurd things. If it was a vessel, she must have gone\ndown, for when it cleared up she was not to be seen. I am not very\ncredulous, and nothing but the occurrence of the consequences\nwhich you anticipate will make me believe that there was anything\nsupernatural in the affair.\"\n\n\"Well! I shall not be sorry if the event proves me wrong,\" replied\nPhilip; \"but I have my forebodings--we are not in port yet.\"\n\n\"No! but we are but a trifling distance from it, and there is every\nprospect of a continuance of fine weather.\"\n\n\"There is no saying from what quarter the danger may come,\" replied\nPhilip; \"we have other things to fear than the violence of the gale.\"\n\n\"True,\" replied Krantz; \"but, nevertheless, don't let us croak.\nNotwithstanding all you say, I prophesy that in two days, at the\nfarthest, we are safely anchored in Table Bay.\"\n\nThe conversation here dropped, and Philip was glad to be left alone. A\nmelancholy had seized him--a depression of spirits even greater than\nhe had ever felt before. He leant over the gangway and watched the\nheaving of the sea.\n\n\"Merciful Heaven!\" ejaculated he, \"be pleased to spare this vessel;\nlet not the wail of women, the shrieks of the poor children, now\nembarked, be heard; the numerous body of men, trusting to her\nplanks,--let them not be sacrificed for my father's crimes.\" And\nPhilip mused. \"The ways of Heaven are indeed mysterious,\" thought\nhe.--\"Why should others suffer because my father has sinned? And yet,\nis it not so everywhere? How many thousands fall on the field of\nbattle in a war occasioned by the ambition of a king, or the influence\nof a woman! How many millions have been destroyed for holding a\ndifferent creed of faith! _He_ works in His own way, leaving us to\nwonder and to doubt.\"\n\nThe sun had set before Philip had quitted the gangway and gone down\nbelow. Commending himself and those embarked with him to the care of\nProvidence, he at last fell asleep; but, before the bell was struck\neight times to announce midnight, he was awakened by a rude shove of\nthe shoulder, and perceived Krantz, who had the first watch, standing\nby him.\n\n\"By the Heaven above us! Vanderdecken, you have prophesied right!\nUp--quick! _The ship's on fire_!\"\n\n\"On fire!\" exclaimed Vanderdecken, jumping out of his berth--\"where?\"\n\n\"The main-hold.\"\n\n\"I will up immediately, Krantz. In the meantime, keep the hatches on\nand rig the pumps.\"\n\nIn less than a minute Philip was on deck, where he found Captain\nBarentz, who had also been informed of the case by the second\nmate.--In a few words all was explained by Krantz: there was a strong\nsmell of fire proceeding from the main-hold; and, on removing one of\nthe hatches, which he had done without calling for any assistance,\nfrom a knowledge of the panic it would create, he found that the hold\nwas full of smoke; he had put it on again immediately, and had only\nmade it known to Philip and the captain.\n\n\"Thanks for your presence of mind,\" replied Philip; \"we have now time\nto reflect quietly on what is to be done. If the troops and the poor\nwomen and children knew their danger, their alarm would have much\nimpeded us: but how could she have taken fire in the main-hold?\"\n\n\"I never heard of the _Vrow Katerina_ taking fire before,\" observed\nthe captain; \"I think it is impossible. It must be some mistake--she\nis--\"\n\n\"I now recollect that we have, in our cargo, several cases of vitriol\nin bottles,\" interrupted Philip. \"In the gale, they must have been\ndisturbed and broken. I kept them above all, in case of accident: this\nrolling, gunwale under, for so long a time must have occasioned one of\nthem to fetch way.\"\n\n\"That's it, depend upon it,\" observed Krantz.\n\n\"I did object to receive them, stating that they ought to go out in\nsome vessel which was not so encumbered with troops, so that they\nmight remain on the main-deck; but they replied, that the invoices\nwere made out and could not be altered. But now to act. My idea is to\nkeep the hatches on, so as to smother it if possible.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Krantz; and, at the same time, cut a hole in the deck\njust large enough to admit the hose, and pump as much water as we can\ndown into the hold.\"\n\n\"You are right, Krantz; send for the carpenter, and set him to work. I\nwill turn the hands up and speak to the men. I smell the fire now very\nstrong; there is no time to lose.--If we can only keep the troops and\nthe women quiet we may do something.\"\n\nThe hands were turned up, and soon made their appearance on deck,\nwondering why they were summoned. The men had not perceived the state\nof the vessel, for, the hatches having been kept on, the little smoke\nthat issued ascended the hatchway and did not fill the lower deck.\n\n\"My lads,\" said Philip, \"I am sorry to say that we have reason to\nsuspect that there is some danger of fire in the main-hold.\"\n\n\"I smell it!\" cried one of the seamen.\n\n\"So do I,\" cried several others, with every show of alarm, and moving\naway as if to go below.\n\n\"Silence, and remain where you are, my men. Listen to what I say: if\nyou frighten the troops and passengers we shall do nothing; we must\ntrust to ourselves; there is no time to be lost.--Mr Krantz and the\ncarpenter are doing all that can be done at present; and now, my men,\ndo me the favour to sit down on the deck, every one of you, while I\ntell you what we must do.\"\n\nThis order of Philip's was obeyed, and the effect was excellent: it\ngave the men time to compose themselves after the first shock; for,\nperhaps, of all shocks to the human frame, there is none which creates\na greater panic than the first intimation of fire on board of a\nvessel--a situation, indeed, pitiable, when it is considered that you\nhave to choose between the two elements seeking your destruction.\nPhilip did not speak for a minute or two. He then pointed out to the\nmen the danger of their situation, what were the measures which he\nand Krantz had decided upon taking, and how necessary it was that all\nshould be cool and collected. He also reminded them that they had but\nlittle powder in the magazine, which was far from the site of the\nfire, and could easily be removed and thrown overboard; and that, if\nthe fire could not be extinguished, they had a quantity of spars on\ndeck to form a raft, which, with the boats, would receive all on\nboard, and that they were but a short distance from land.\n\nPhilip's address had the most beneficial effects; the men rose up when\nhe ordered them; one portion went down to the magazine, and handed up\nthe powder, which was passed along and thrown overboard; another went\nto the pumps; and Krantz, coming up, reported the hole to have been\ncut in the planking of the deck above the main-hold: the hoses were\nfixed, and a quantity of water soon poured down, but it was impossible\nthat the danger could be kept secret. The troops were sleeping on\nthe deck, and the very employment of the seamen pointed out what had\noccurred, even if the smoke, which now increased very much, and filled\nthe lower deck, had not betrayed it. In a few minutes the alarm of\n_Fire_! was heard throughout the vessel, and men, women, and children\nwere seen, some hurrying on their clothes, some running frightened\nabout the decks, some shrieking, some praying, and the confusion and\nterror were hardly to be described.\n\nThe judicious conduct of Philip was then made evident: had the sailors\nbeen awakened by the appalling cry, they would have been equally\nincapable of acting, as were the troops and passengers. All\nsubordination would have ceased: some would have seized the boats,\nand left the majority to perish: others would have hastened to the\nspirit-room, and, by their drunkenness, added to the confusion and\nhorror of the scene: nothing would have been effected, and almost all\nwould, in all probability, have perished miserably. But this had been\nprevented by the presence of mind shown by Philip and the second mate,\nfor the captain was a cypher:--not wanting in courage certainly, but\nwithout conduct or a knowledge of his profession. The seamen continued\nsteady to their duty, pushing the soldiers out of the way as they\nperformed their allotted tasks: and Philip perceiving this, went\ndown below, leaving Krantz in charge; and by reasoning with the most\ncollected, by degrees he brought the majority of the troops to a state\nof comparative coolness.\n\nThe powder had been thrown overboard, and another hole having been cut\nin the deck on the other side, the other pump was rigged, and double\nthe quantity of water poured into the hold; but it was evident to\nPhilip that the combustion increased. The smoke and steam now burst\nthrough the interstices of the hatchways and the holes cut in the\ndeck, with a violence that proved the extent of the fire which raged\nbelow, and Philip thought it advisable to remove all the women and\nchildren to the poop and quarter-deck of the ship, desiring the\nhusbands of the women to stay with them. It was a melancholy sight,\nand the tears stood in Philip's eyes as he looked upon the group of\nfemales--some weeping and straining their children to their bosoms;\nsome more quiet and more collected than the men: the elder children\nmute or crying because their mothers cried, and the younger ones,\nunconscious of danger, playing with the first object which attracted\ntheir attention, or smiling at their parents. The officers commanding\nthe troops were two ensigns newly entered, and very young men,\nignorant of their duty and without any authority--for men in cases\nof extreme danger will not obey those who are more ignorant than\nthemselves--and, at Philip's request, they remained with and\nsuperintended the women and children.\n\nSo soon as Philip had given his orders that the women and children\nshould be properly clothed (which many of them were not), he went\nagain forward to superintend the labour of the seamen, who already\nbegan to show symptoms of fatigue, from the excess of their exertions;\nbut many of the soldiers now offered to work at the pumps, and their\nservices were willingly accepted. Their efforts were in vain. In about\nhalf an hour more the hatches were blown up with a loud noise, and a\ncolumn of intense and searching flame darted up perpendicularly from\nthe hold, high as the lower mast-head. Then was heard the loud shriek\nof the women, who pressed their children in agony to their breasts,\nas the seamen and soldiers who had been working the pumps, in their\nprecipitate retreat from the scorching flames, rushed aft, and fell\namong the huddled crowd.\n\n\"Be steady, my lads--steady, my good fellows,\" exclaimed Philip;\n\"there is no danger yet. Recollect, we have our boats and raft, and\nalthough we cannot subdue the fire, and save the vessel, still we\nmay, if you are cool and collected, not only save ourselves, but\neveryone--even the poor infants, who now appeal to you as men to\nexert yourselves in their behalf. Come, come, my lads, let us do our\nduty--we have the means of escape in our power if we lose no time.\nCarpenter, get your axes, and cut away the boom-lashings. Now, my men,\nlet us get our boats out, and make a raft for these poor women and\nchildren; we are not ten miles from the land. Krantz, see to the boats\nwith the starboard watch; larboard watch with me, to launch over the\nbooms. Gunners, take any of the cordage you can, ready for lashing.\nCome, my lads, there is no want of light--we can work without\nlanterns.\"\n\nThe men obeyed, as Philip, to encourage them, had almost jocularly\nremarked (for a joke is often well-timed, when apparently on the\nthreshold of eternity), there was no want of light. The column of fire\nnow ascended above the main-top--licking with its forky tongue the\ntop-mast rigging--and embracing the mainmast in its folds: and the\nloud roar with which it ascended proved the violence and rapidity of\nthe combustion below, and how little time there was to be lost. The\nlower and main decks were now so filled with smoke that no one could\nremain there: some few poor fellows, sick in their cots, had long been\nsmothered, for they had been forgotten. The swell had much subsided,\nand there was not a breath of wind: the smoke which rose from the\nhatchways ascended straight up in the air, which, as the vessel had\nlost all steerage way, was fortunate. The boats were soon in the\nwater, and trusty men placed in them: the spars were launched over,\narranged by the men in the boats, and lashed together. All the\ngratings were then collected and firmly fixed upon the spars for the\npeople to sit upon; and Philip's heart was glad at the prospect which\nhe now had of saving the numbers which were embarked.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVII\n\n\nBut their difficulties were not surmounted--the fire now had\ncommunicated to the main-deck, and burst out of the port-holes\namidships--and the raft which had been forming alongside was obliged\nto be drifted astern, where it was more exposed to the swell. This\nretarded their labour, and, in the meantime, the fire was making rapid\nprogress; the mainmast, which had long been burning, fell over the\nside with the lurching of the vessel, and the flames out of the\nmain-deck ports soon showed their points above the bulwarks,\nwhile volumes of smoke were poured in upon the upper deck,\nalmost suffocating the numbers which were crowded there; for all\ncommunication with the fore-part of the ship had been, for some time,\ncut off by the flames, and everyone had retreated aft. The women and\nchildren were now carried on to the poop; not only to remove them\nfarther from the suffocating smoke, but that they might be lowered\ndown to the raft from the stern.\n\nIt was about four o'clock in the morning when all was ready, and by\nthe exertions of Philip and the seamen, notwithstanding the swell,\nthe women and children were safely placed on the raft, where it was\nconsidered that they would be less in the way, as the men could\nrelieve each other in pulling when they were tired.\n\nAfter the women and children had been lowered down, the troops were\nnext ordered to descend by the ladders; some few were lost in the\nattempt, falling under the boat's bottom and not reappearing; but\ntwo-thirds of the men were safely put in the berths they were ordered\nto take by Krantz, who had gone down to superintend this important\narrangement. Such had been the vigilance of Philip, who had requested\nCaptain Barentz to stand over the spirit-room hatch, with pistols,\nuntil the smoke on the main-deck rendered the precaution unnecessary,\nthat not a single person was intoxicated, and to this might be\nascribed the order and regularity which had prevailed during this\ntrying scene. But before one-third of the soldiers had descended by\nthe stern ladder, the fire burst out of the stern windows with a\nviolence that nothing could withstand; spouts of vivid flame extended\nseveral feet from the vessel, roaring with the force of a blow-pipe;\nat the same time, the flames burst through all the after-ports of the\nmain-deck, and those remaining on board found themselves encircled\nwith fire, and suffocated with smoke and heat. The stern ladders were\nconsumed in a minute and dropped into the sea; the boats which had\nbeen receiving the men were obliged, also, to back astern from the\nintense heat of the flames; even those on the raft shrieked as they\nfound themselves scorched by the ignited fragments which fell on them\nas they were enveloped in an opaque cloud of smoke, which hid from\nthem those who still remained on the deck of the vessel. Philip\nattempted to speak to those on board, but he was not heard. A scene\nof confusion took place which ended in great loss of life. The only\nobject appeared to be who should first escape; though, except by\njumping overboard, there was no escape. Had they waited, and (as\nPhilip would have pointed out to them) have one by one thrown\nthemselves into the sea, the men in the boats were fully prepared\nto pick them up; or had they climbed out to the end of the lateen\nmizen-yard which was lowered down, they might have descended safely by\na rope, but the scorching of the flames which surrounded them and the\nsuffocation from the smoke was overpowering, and most of the soldiers\nsprang over the taffrail at once, or as nearly so as possible. The\nconsequence was that there were thirty or forty in the water at the\nsame time, and the scene was as heart-rending as it was appalling; the\nsailors in the boats dragging them in as fast as they could--the women\non the raft, throwing to them loose garments to haul them in; at one\ntime a wife shrieking as she saw her husband struggling and sinking\ninto eternity;--at another, curses and execrations from the swimmer\nwho was grappled with by the drowning man, and dragged with him under\nthe surface. Of eighty men who were left of the troops on board at the\ntime of the bursting out of the flames from the stern windows, but\ntwenty-five were saved. There were but few seamen left on board with\nPhilip, the major part having been employed in making the raft or\nmanning the three boats; those who were on board remained by his side,\nregulating their motions by his. After allowing full time for the\nsoldiers to be picked up, Philip ordered the men to climb out to the\nend of the lateen yard which hung on the taffrail, and either to lower\nthemselves down on the raft if it was under, or to give notice to the\nboats to receive them. The raft had been dropped farther astern by the\nseamen, that those on board of it might not suffer from the smoke and\nheat; and the sailors, one after another, lowered themselves down\nand were received by the boats. Philip desired Captain Barentz to go\nbefore him, but the captain refused. He was too much choked with smoke\nto say why, but no doubt but that it would have been something in\npraise of the _Vrow Katerina_. Philip then climbed out; he was\nfollowed by the captain, and they were both received into one of the\nboats.\n\nThe rope which had hitherto held the raft to the ship, was now cast\noff, and it was taken in by the boats; and in a short time the _Vrow\nKaterina_ was borne to leeward of them; and Philip and Krantz now made\narrangements for the better disposal of the people. The sailors were\nalmost all put into boats, that they might relieve one another in\npulling; the remainder were placed on the raft, along with the\nsoldiers, the women, and the children. Notwithstanding that the boats\nwere all as much loaded as they could well bear, the numbers on the\nraft were so great that it sunk nearly a foot under water when the\nswell of the sea poured upon it; but stanchions and ropes to support\nthose on board had been fixed, and the men remained at the sides,\nwhile the women and children were crowded together in the middle.\n\nAs soon as these arrangements were made, the boats took the raft in\ntow, and just as the dawn of day appeared, pulled in the direction of\nthe land.\n\nThe _Vrow Katerina_ was, by this time, one volume of flame; she had\ndrifted about half a mile to leeward, and Captain Barentz, who was\nwatching her as he sat in the boat with Philip, exclaimed--\"Well,\nthere goes a lovely ship, a ship that could do everything but\nspeak--I'm sure that not a ship in the fleet would have made such a\nbonfire as she has--does she not burn beautifully--nobly? My poor\n_Vrow Katerina_! perfect to the last, we never shall see such a ship\nas you again! Well, I'm glad my father did not live to see this sight,\nfor it would have broken his heart, poor man.\"\n\nPhilip made no reply, he felt a respect even for Captain Barentz's\nmisplaced regard for the vessel. They made but little way, for the\nswell was rather against them, and the raft was deep in the water. The\nday dawned, and the appearance of the weather was not favourable; it\npromised the return of the gale. Already a breeze ruffled the surface\nof the water, and the swell appeared to increase rather than go down.\nThe sky was overcast and the horizon thick. Philip looked out for the\nland but could not perceive it, for there was a haze on the horizon,\nso that he could not see more than five miles. He felt that to gain\nthe shore before the coming night was necessary for the preservation\nof so many individuals, of whom more than sixty were women and\nchildren, who, without any nourishment, were sitting on a frail raft,\nimmersed in the water. No land in sight--a gale coming on, and in\nall probability, a heavy sea and dark night. The chance was indeed\ndesperate, and Philip was miserable--most miserable--when he reflected\nthat so many innocent beings might, before the next morning,\nbe consigned to a watery tomb,--and why?--yes, there was the\nfeeling--that although Philip could reason against, he never could\nconquer; for his own life he cared nothing--even the idea of his\nbeloved Amine was nothing in the balance at these moments. The only\npoint which sustained him, was the knowledge that he had his duty to\nperform, and, in the full exercise of his duty, he recovered himself.\n\n\"Land ahead!\" was now cried out by Krantz, who was in the headmost\nboat, and the news was received with a shout of joy from the raft and\nthe boats. The anticipation and the hope the news gave was like manna\nin the wilderness; and the poor women on the raft, drenched sometimes\nabove the waist by the swell of the sea, clasped the children in their\narms still closer, and cried--\"My darling, you shall be saved.\"\n\nPhilip stood upon the stern-sheets to survey the land, and he had the\nsatisfaction of finding that it was not five miles distant, and a ray\nof hope warmed his heart. The breeze now had gradually increased, and\nrippled the water. The quarter from which the wind came was neither\nfavourable nor adverse, being on the beam. Had they had sails for the\nboats, it would have been otherwise, but they had been stowed away and\ncould not be procured. The sight of land naturally rejoiced them all,\nand the seamen in the boats cheered, and double-banked the oars to\nincrease their way; but the towing of a large raft sunk under water\nwas no easy task; and they did not, with all their exertions, advance\nmore than half a mile an hour.\n\nUntil noon they continued their exertions, not without success;\nthey were not three miles from the land; but, as the sun passed the\nmeridian, a change took place; the breeze blew strong; the swell of\nthe sea rose rapidly; and the raft was often so deeply immersed in the\nwaves as to alarm them for the safety of those upon her. Their way\nwas proportionally retarded, and by three o'clock they had not gained\nhalf-a-mile from where they had been at noon. The men not having had\nrefreshment of any kind during the labour and excitement of so many\nhours, began to flag in their exertions. The wish for water was\nexpressed by all--from the child who appealed to its mother, to the\nseaman who strained at the oar. Philip did all he could to encourage\nthe men; but finding themselves so near to the land, and so overcome\nwith fatigue, and that the raft in tow would not allow them to\napproach their haven, they murmured, and talked of the necessity of\ncasting loose the raft and looking out for themselves. A feeling of\nself prevailed, and they were mutinous: but Philip expostulated with\nthem, and out of respect for him, they continued their exertions for\nanother hour, when a circumstance occurred which decided the question,\nupon which they had recommenced a debate.\n\nThe increased swell and the fresh breeze had so beat about and tossed\nthe raft, that it was with difficulty, for some time, that its\noccupants could hold themselves on it. A loud shout, mingled with\nscreams, attracted the attention of those in the boats, and Philip,\nlooking back, perceived that the lashings of the raft had yielded to\nthe force of the waves, and that it had separated amidships. The\nscene was agonising; husbands were separated from their wives and\nchildren--each floating away from each other--for the part of the raft\nwhich was still towed by the boats had already left the other far\nastern. The women rose up and screamed, and held up their children;\nsome, more frantic, dashed into the water between them, and attempted\nto gain the floating wreck upon which their husbands stood, and sank\nbefore they could be assisted. But the horror increased--one lashing\nhaving given way, all the rest soon followed; and, before the boats\ncould turn and give assistance the sea was strewed with the spars\nwhich composed the raft, with men, women, and children clinging to\nthem. Loud were the yells of despair, and the shrieks of the women,\nas they embraced their offspring, and in attempting to save them were\nlost themselves. The spars of the raft still close together, were\nhurled one upon the other by the swell, and many found death by\nbeing jammed between them. Although all the boats hastened to their\nassistance, there was so much difficulty and danger in forcing them\nbetween the spars, that but few were saved, and even those few were\nmore than the boats could well take in. The seamen and a few soldiers\nwere picked up, but all the females and the children had sank beneath\nthe waves.\n\nThe effect of this catastrophe may be imagined, but hardly described.\nThe seamen who had debated as to casting them adrift to perish, wept\nas they pulled towards the shore. Philip was overcome, he covered his\nface, and remained, for some time, without giving directions, and\nheedless of what passed.\n\nIt was now five o'clock in the evening; the boats had cast off the\ntow-lines, and vied with each other in their exertions. Before the sun\nhad set they all had arrived at the beach, and were safely landed in\nthe little sand bay into which they had steered; for the wind was off\nthe shore, and there was no surf. The boats were hauled up, and the\nexhausted men lay down on the sands, till warm with the heat of the\nsun, and forgetting that they had neither eaten nor drank for so long\na time, they were soon fast asleep. Captain Barentz, Philip, and\nKrantz, as soon as they had seen the boats secured, held a short\nconsultation, and were then glad to follow the example of the seamen;\nharassed and worn out with the fatigue of the last twenty-four hours,\ntheir senses were soon drowned in oblivion.\n\nFor many hours they all slept soundly, dreamt of water, and awoke to\nthe sad reality that they were tormented with thirst, and were on a\nsandy beach with the salt waves mocking them; but they reflected how\nmany of their late companions had been swallowed up, and felt thankful\nthat they had been spared. It was early dawn when they all rose from\nthe forms which they had impressed on the yielding sand; and, by the\ndirections of Philip, they separated in every direction, to look for\nthe means of quenching their agony of thirst. As they proceeded over\nthe sand-hills, they found growing in the sand a low spongy-leaf\nsort of shrub, something like what in our greenhouses is termed the\nice-plant; the thick leaves of which were covered with large drops\nof dew. They sank down on their knees, and proceeded from one to the\nother licking off the moisture which was abundant, and soon felt\na temporary relief. They continued their search till noon without\nsuccess, and hunger was now added to their thirst; they then\nreturned to the beach to ascertain if their companions had been more\nsuccessful. They had also quenched their thirst with the dew of\nheaven, but had found no water or means of subsistence; but some of\nthem had eaten the leaves of the plant which had contained the dew in\nthe morning, and had found them, although acid, full of watery sap and\ngrateful to the palate. The plant in question is the one provided by\nbounteous Providence for the support of the camel and other beasts\nin the arid desert, only to be found there, and devoured by all\nruminating animals with avidity. By the advice of Philip they\ncollected a quantity of this plant and put it into the boats, and then\nlaunched.\n\nThey were not more than fifty miles from Table Bay, and although they\nhad no sails, the wind was in their favour. Philip pointed out to them\nhow useless it was to remain, when before morning they would, in all\nprobability, arrive at where they would obtain all they required. The\nadvice was approved of and acted upon; the boats were shoved off and\nthe oars resumed. So tired and exhausted were the men, that their oars\ndipped mechanically into the water, for there was no strength left to\nbe applied; it was not until the next morning at daylight, that they\nhad arrived opposite False Bay, and they had still many miles to pull.\nThe wind in their favour had done almost all--the men could do little\nor nothing.\n\nEncouraged, however, by the sight of land which they knew, they\nrallied; and at about noon they pulled exhausted to the beach at the\nbottom of Table Bay, near to which were the houses, and the fort\nprotecting the settlers who had for some few years resided there. They\nlanded close to where a broad rivulet at that season (but a torrent\nin the winter) poured its stream into the Bay. At the sight of fresh\nwater, some of the men dropped their oars, threw themselves into the\nsea when out of their depth--others when the water was above their\nwaists--yet they did not arrive so soon as those who waited till the\nboat struck the beach, and jumped out upon dry land. And then they\nthrew themselves into the rivulet, which coursed over the shingle,\nabout five or six inches in depth, allowing the refreshing stream to\npour into their mouths till they could receive no more, immersing\ntheir hot hands, and rolling in it with delight.\n\nDespots and fanatics have exerted their ingenuity to invent torments\nfor their victims--how useless!--the rack, the boot, fire,--all that\nthey have imagined are not to be compared to the torture of extreme\nthirst. In the extremity of agony the sufferers cry for water and\nit is not refused: they might have spared themselves their refined\ningenuity of torment and the disgusting exhibition of it, had they\nonly confined the prisoner in his cell, and refused him _water_.\n\nAs soon as they had satisfied the most pressing of all wants, they\nrose dripping from the stream, and walked up to the houses of the\nfactory; the inhabitants of which, perceiving that boats had landed,\nwhen there was no vessel in the Bay, naturally concluded that some\ndisaster had happened, and were walking down to meet them.--Their\ntragical history was soon told. The thirty-six men that stood before\nthem were all that were left of nearly three hundred souls embarked,\nand they had been more than two days without food. At this intimation\nno further questions were asked by the considerate settlers, until the\nhunger of the sufferers had been appeased, when the narrative of their\nsufferings was fully detailed by Philip and Krantz.\n\n\"I have an idea that I have seen you before,\" observed one of the\nsettlers; \"did you come on shore when the fleet anchored?\"\n\n\"I did not,\" replied Philip; \"but I have been here.\"\n\n\"I recollect, now,\" replied the man; \"you were the only survivor of\nthe _Ter Schilling_, which was lost in False Bay.\"\n\n\"Not the only survivor,\" replied Philip; \"I thought so myself, but I\nafterwards met the pilot, a one-eyed man, of the name of Schriften,\nwho was my shipmate--he must have arrived here after me. You saw him,\nof course?\"\n\n\"No, I did not; no one belonging to the _Ter Schilling_ ever came here\nafter you, for I have been a settler here ever since, and it is not\nlikely that I should forget such a circumstance.\"\n\n\"He must, then, have returned to Holland by some other means.\"\n\n\"I know not how.--Our ships never go near the coast after they leave\nthe Bay; it is too dangerous.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, I saw him,\" replied Philip, musing.\n\n\"If you saw him, that is sufficient: perhaps some vessel had been\nblown down to the eastern side, and picked him up; but the natives in\nthat part are not likely to have spared the life of a European. The\nCaffres are a cruel people.\"\n\nThe information that Schriften had not been seen at the Cape, was a\nsubject of meditation to Philip. He had always an idea, as the reader\nknows, that there was something supernatural about the man, and this\nopinion was corroborated by the report of the settler.\n\nWe must pass over the space of two months, during which the wrecked\nseamen were treated with kindness by the settlers, and, at the\nexpiration of which, a small brig arrived at the Bay, and took in\nrefreshments: she was homeward bound, with a full cargo, and being\nchartered by the Company, could not refuse to receive on board the\ncrew of the _Vrow Katerina_. Philip, Krantz, and the seamen embarked,\nbut Captain Barentz remained behind to settle at the Cape.\n\n\"Should I go home,\" said he to Philip, who argued with him, \"I have\nnothing in this world to return for. I have no wife--no children--I\nhad but one dear object, my _Vrow Katerina_, who was my wife, my\nchild, my everything--she is gone, and I never shall find another\nvessel like her; and if I could, I should not love it as I did her.\nNo, my affections are buried with her; are entombed in the deep sea.\nHow beautifully she burnt! she went out of the world like a phoenix,\nas she was. No! no! I will be faithful to her--I will send for what\nlittle money I have, and live as near to her tomb as I can--I never\nshall forget her as long as I live. I shall mourn over her, and 'Vrow\nKaterina,' when I die, will be found engraven on my heart.\"\n\nPhilip could not help wishing that his affections had been fixed upon\na more deserving object, as then, probably, the tragical loss had\nnot taken place; but he changed the subject, feeling that, being no\nsailor, Captain Barentz was much better on shore, than in the command\nof a vessel. They shook hands and parted--Philip promising to execute\nBarentz's commission, which was to turn his money into articles most\nuseful to a settler, and have them sent out by the first fleet which\nshould sail from the Zuyder Zee. But this commission it was not\nPhilip's good fortune to execute. The brig, named the _Wilhelmina_,\nsailed, and soon arrived at St Helena. After watering she proceeded on\nher voyage. They had made the Western Isles, and Philip was consoling\nhimself with the anticipation of soon joining his Amine, when to the\nnorthward of the Islands, they met with a furious gale, before which\nthey were obliged to scud for many days, with the vessel's head to the\nsouth-east; and as the wind abated and they were able to haul to it,\nthey fell in with a Dutch fleet, of five vessels, commanded by an\nAdmiral, which had left Amsterdam more than two months, and had been\nbuffeted about, by contrary gales, for the major part of that period.\nCold, fatigue, and bad provisions had brought on the scurvy, and the\nships were so weakly manned that they could hardly navigate them. When\nthe captain of the _Wilhelmina_ reported to the Admiral that he had\npart of the crew of the _Vrow Katerina_ on board, he was ordered\nto send them immediately to assist in navigating his crippled\nfleet--remonstrance was useless--Philip had but time to write to\nAmine, acquainting her with his misfortunes and disappointment; and,\nconfiding the letter to his wife, as well as his narrative of the loss\nof the _Vrow Katerina_ for the directors, to the charge of the captain\nof the _Wilhelmina_, he hastened to pack up his effects, and repaired\non board of the Admiral's ship, with Krantz and the crew. To them were\nadded six of the men belonging to the _Wilhelmina_, which the Admiral\ninsisted on retaining; and the brig, having received the Admiral's\ndespatches, was then permitted to continue her voyage.\n\nPerhaps there is nothing more trying to the seaman's feelings, than\nbeing unexpectedly forced to recommence another series of trials, at\nthe very time when they anticipate repose from the former; yet, how\noften does this happen! Philip was melancholy. \"It is my destiny,\"\nthought he, using the words of Amine, \"and why should I not submit?\"\nKrantz was furious, and the seamen discontented and mutinous--but\nit was useless. Might is right on the vast ocean, where there is no\nappeal--no trial or injunction to be obtained.\n\nBut hard as their case appeared to them, the Admiral was fully\njustified in his proceeding. His ships were almost unmanageable with\nthe few hands who could still perform their duty; and this small\nincrease of physical power might be the means of saving hundreds who\nlay helpless in their hammocks. In his own vessel, the _Lion_, which\nwas manned with two hundred and fifty men, when she sailed from\nAmsterdam, there were not more than seventy capable of doing duty; and\nthe other ships had suffered in proportion.\n\nThe first captain of the _Lion_ was dead, the second captain in his\nhammock, and the Admiral had no one to assist him but the mates of the\nvessel, some of whom crawled up to their duty more dead than alive.\nThe ship of the second in command, the _Dort_, was even in a more\ndeplorable plight. The Commodore was dead; the first captain was still\ndoing his duty; but he had but one more officer capable of remaining\non deck.\n\nThe Admiral sent for Philip into his cabin, and having heard his\nnarrative of the loss of the _Vrow Katerina_, he ordered him to go on\nboard of the Commodore's ship as captain, giving the rank of Commodore\nto the captain at present on board of her; Krantz was retained on\nboard his own vessel, as second captain; for, by Philip's narrative,\nthe Admiral perceived at once that they were both good officers and\nbrave men.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVIII\n\n\nThe fleet under Admiral Rymelandt's command was ordered to proceed to\nthe East Indies by the western route, through the Straits of Magellan\ninto the Pacific Ocean--it being still imagined, notwithstanding\nprevious failures, that this route offered facilities which might\nshorten the passage of the Spice Islands.\n\nThe vessels composing the fleet were the _Lion_ of forty-four guns,\nbearing the Admiral's flag; the _Dort_ of thirty-six guns, with the\nCommodore's pendant--to which Philip was appointed; the _Zuyder Zee_\nof twenty; the _Young Frau_ of twelve, and a ketch of four guns,\ncalled the _Schevelling_.\n\nThe crew of the _Vrow Katerina_ were divided between the two larger\nvessels; the others, being smaller, were easier worked with fewer\nhands. Every arrangement having been made, the boats were hoisted\nup, and the ships made sail. For ten days they were baffled by light\nwinds, and the victims to the scurvy increased considerably on board\nof Philip's vessel. Many died and were thrown overboard, and others\nwere carried down to their hammocks.\n\nThe newly-appointed Commodore, whose name was Avenhorn, went on board\nof the Admiral, to report the state of the vessel, and to suggest, as\nPhilip had proposed to him, that they should make the coast of South\nAmerica, and endeavour, by bribery or by force, to obtain supplies\neither from the Spanish inhabitants or the natives. But to this the\nAdmiral would not listen. He was an imperious, bold, and obstinate\nman, not to be persuaded or convinced, and with little feeling for\nthe sufferings of others. Tenacious of being advised, he immediately\nrejected a proposition which, had it originated with himself, would\nprobably have been immediately acted upon; and the Commodore returned\non board his vessel, not only disappointed, but irritated by the\nlanguage used towards him.\n\n\"What are we to do, Captain Vanderdecken? you know too well our\nsituation--it is impossible we can continue long at sea; if we do, the\nvessel will be drifting at the mercy of the waves, while the crew die\na wretched death in their hammocks. At present, we have forty men\nleft; in ten days more we shall probably have but twenty; for as the\nlabour becomes more severe, so do they drop down the faster. Is it not\nbetter to risk our lives in combat with the Spaniards, than die here\nlike rotten sheep?\"\n\n\"I perfectly agree with you, Commodore,\" replied Philip; \"but still we\nmust obey orders. The Admiral is an inflexible man.\"\n\n\"And a cruel one. I have a great mind to part company in the night,\nand, if he finds fault, I will justify myself to the directors on my\nreturn.\"\n\n\"Do nothing rashly--perhaps, when day by day he finds his own ship's\ncompany more weakened, he will see the necessity of following your\nadvice.\"\n\nA week had passed away after this conversation, and the fleet had made\nlittle progress. In each ship the ravages of the fatal disease became\nmore serious, and, as the Commodore had predicted, he had but twenty\nmen really able to do duty. Nor had the Admiral's ship and the other\nvessels suffered less. The Commodore again went on board to reiterate\nhis proposition.\n\nAdmiral Rymelandt was not only a stern, but a vindictive man. He\nwas aware of the propriety of the suggestion made by his second in\ncommand, but, having refused it, he would not acquiesce; and he felt\nrevengeful against the Commodore, whose counsel he must now either\nadopt, or by refusing it be prevented from taking the steps so\nnecessary for the preservation of his crew, and the success of his\nvoyage. Too proud to acknowledge himself in error, again did he\ndecidedly refuse, and the Commodore went back to his own ship. The\nfleet was then within three days of the coast, steering to the\nsouthward for the Straits of Magellan, and that night, after Philip\nhad retired to his cot, the Commodore went on deck and ordered the\ncourse of the vessel to be altered some points more to the westward.\nThe night was very dark, and the _Lion_ was the only ship which\ncarried a poop-lantern, so that the parting company of the _Dort_ was\nnot perceived by the Admiral and the other ships of the fleet. When\nPhilip went on deck next morning, he found that their consorts were\nnot in sight. He looked at the compass, and, perceiving that the\ncourse was altered, inquired at what hour and by whose directions.\nFinding that it was by his superior officer, he of course said\nnothing. When the Commodore came on deck, he stated to Philip that he\nfelt himself warranted in not complying with the Admiral's orders, as\nit would have been sacrificing the whole ship's company. This was,\nindeed, true.\n\nIn two days they made the land, and, running into the shore, perceived\na large town and Spaniards on the beach. They anchored at the mouth of\nthe river, and hoisted English colours, when a boat came on board to\nask them who they were and what they required? The Commodore replied\nthat the vessel was English, for he knew that the hatred of the\nSpanish to the Dutch was so great that, if known to belong to that\nnation, he would have had no chance of procuring any supplies, except\nby force. He stated that he had fallen in with a Spanish vessel, a\ncomplete wreck, from the whole of the crew being afflicted with the\nscurvy; that he had taken the men out, who were now in their\nhammocks below, as he considered it cruel to leave so many of his\nfellow-creatures to perish, and that he had come out of his course to\nland them at the first Spanish fort he could reach. He requested that\nthey would immediately send on board vegetables and fresh provisions\nfor the sick men, whom it would be death to remove, until after a few\ndays, when they would be a little restored; and added, that in return\nfor their assisting the Spaniards, he trusted the Governor would also\nsend supplies for his own people.\n\nThis well made-up story was confirmed by the officer sent on board by\nthe Spanish Governor. Being requested to go down below and see the\npatients, the sight of so many poor fellows in the last stage of that\nhorrid disease--their teeth fallen out, gums ulcerated, bodies full\nof tumours and sores--was quite sufficient, and, hurrying up from the\nlower deck, as he would have done from a charnel-house, the officer\nhastened on shore and made his report.\n\nIn two hours a large boat was sent off with fresh beef and vegetables\nsufficient for three days' supply for the ship's company, and these\nwere immediately distributed among the men. A letter of thanks was\nreturned by the Commodore, stating that his health was so indifferent\nas to prevent his coming on shore in person to thank the Governor, and\nforwarding a pretended list of the Spaniards on board, in which he\nmentioned some officers and people of distinction, whom he imagined\nmight be connected with the family of the Governor, whose name and\ntitles he had received from the messenger sent on board; for the Dutch\nknew full well the majority of the noble Spanish families--indeed,\nalliances had continually taken place between them, previous to their\nassertion of their independence. The Commodore concluded his letter by\nexpressing a hope that, in a day or two, he should be able to pay his\nrespects and make arrangements for the landing of the sick, as he was\nanxious to proceed on his voyage of discovery.\n\nOn the third day, a fresh supply of provisions was sent on board, and,\nso soon as they were received, the Commodore, in an English uniform,\nwent on shore and called upon the Governor, gave a long detail of the\nsufferings of the people he had rescued, and agreed that they should\nbe sent on shore in two days, and they would, by that time, be well\nenough to be moved. After many compliments, he went on board, the\nGovernor having stated his intention to return his visit on the\nfollowing day, if the weather were not too rough. Fortunately, the\nweather was rough for the next two days, and it was not until the\nthird that the Governor made his appearance. This was precisely what\nthe Commodore wished.\n\nThere is no disease, perhaps, so dreadful or so rapid in its effects\nupon the human frame, and at the same time so instantaneously checked,\nas the scurvy, if the remedy can be procured. A few days were\nsufficient to restore those, who were not able to turn in their\nhammocks, to their former vigour. In the course of the six days nearly\nall the crew of the _Dort_ were convalescent and able to go on deck;\nbut still they were not cured. The Commodore waited for the arrival of\nthe Governor, received him with all due honours, and then, so soon\nas he was in the cabin, told him very politely that he and all\nhis officers with him were prisoners. That the vessel was a Dutch\nman-of-war, and that it was his own people, and not Spaniards, who had\nbeen dying of the scurvy. He consoled him, however, by pointing out\nthat he had thought it preferable to obtain provisions by this _ruse_,\nthan to sacrifice lives on both sides by taking them by force, and\nthat his Excellency's captivity would endure no longer than until he\nhad received on board a sufficient number of live bullocks and fresh\nvegetables to insure the recovery of the ship's company; and, in the\nmeantime, not the least insult would be offered to him. Whereupon the\nSpanish Governor first looked at the Commodore and then at the file of\narmed men at the cabin door, and then to his distance from the town;\nand then called to mind the possibility of his being taken out to sea.\nWeighing all these points in his mind, and the very moderate ransom\ndemanded (for bullocks were not worth a dollar apiece in that\ncountry), he resolved, as he could not help himself, to comply with\nthe Commodore's terms. He called for pen and ink, and wrote an order\nto send on board immediately all that was demanded. Before sunset the\nbullocks and vegetables were brought off, and, so soon as they were\nalongside, the Commodore, with many bows and many thanks, escorted the\nGovernor to the gangway, complimenting him with a salvo of great guns,\nas he had done before, on his arrival. The people on shore thought\nthat his Excellency had paid a long visit, but, as he did not like to\nacknowledge that he had been deceived, nothing was said about it at\nleast, in his hearing, although the facts were soon well known. As\nsoon as the boats were cleared, the Commodore weighed anchor and made\nsail, well satisfied with having preserved his ship's company; and, as\nthe Falkland Islands, in case of parting company, had been named as\nthe rendezvous, he steered for them. In a fortnight he arrived, and\nfound that his Admiral was not yet there. His crew were now all\nrecovered, and his fresh beef was not yet expended, when he perceived\nthe Admiral and the three other vessels in the offing.\n\nIt appeared that so soon as the _Dort_ had parted company, the Admiral\nhad immediately acted upon the advice that the Commodore had given\nhim, and had run for the coast. Not being so fortunate in a _ruse_\nas his second in command, he had landed an armed force from the four\nvessels, and had succeeded in obtaining several head of cattle, at the\nexpense of an equal number of men killed and wounded. But at the same\ntime they had collected a large quantity of vegetables of one sort or\nanother, which they had carried on board and distributed with great\nsuccess to the sick, who were gradually recovering.\n\nImmediately that the Admiral had anchored, he made the signal for\nthe Commodore to repair on board, and taxed him with disobedience of\norders in having left the fleet. The Commodore did not deny that he\nhad so done, but excused himself upon the plea of necessity, offering\nto lay the whole matter before the Court of Directors so soon as they\nreturned; but the Admiral was vested with most extensive powers, not\nonly of the trial, but the _condemnation_ and punishment of any person\nguilty of mutiny and insubordination in his fleet. In reply, he told\nthe Commodore that he was a prisoner, and, to prove it, he confined\nhim in irons under the half-deck.\n\nA signal was then made for all the captains: they went on board, and\nof course Philip was of the number. On their arrival the Admiral held\na summary court-martial, proving to them by his instructions that he\nwas so warranted to do. The result of the court-martial could be but\none,--condemnation for a breach of discipline, to which Philip was\nobliged reluctantly to sign his name. The Admiral then gave Philip the\nappointment of second in command, and the Commodore's pendant, much to\nthe annoyance of the captains commanding the other vessels,--but in\nthis the Admiral proved his judgment, as there was no one of them so\nfit for the task as Philip. Having so done, he dismissed them. Philip\nwould have spoken to the late Commodore, but the sentry opposed it,\nas against his orders; and with a friendly nod, Philip was obliged to\nleave him without the desired communication.\n\nThe fleet remained three weeks at the Falkland Islands, to recruit the\nships' companies. Although there was no fresh beef, there was plenty\nof scurvy-grass and penguins. These birds were in myriads on some\nparts of the island, which, from the propinquity of their nests, built\nof mud, went by the name of _towns_. There they sat, close together\n(the whole area which they covered being bare of grass), hatching\ntheir eggs and rearing their young. The men had but to select as many\neggs and birds as they pleased, and so numerous were they, that, when\nthey had supplied themselves, there was no apparent diminution of the\nnumbers. This food, although in a short time not very palatable to the\nseamen, had the effect of restoring them to health, and, before the\nfleet sailed, there was not a man who was afflicted with the scurvy.\nIn the meantime the Commodore remained in irons, and many were the\nconjectures concerning his ultimate fate. The power of life and death\nwas known to be in the Admiral's hands, but no one thought that such\npower would be exerted upon a delinquent of so high a grade. The other\ncaptains kept aloof from Philip, and he knew little of what was the\ngeneral idea. Occasionally when on board of the Admiral's ship, he\nventured to bring up the question, but was immediately silenced; and\nfeeling that he might injure the late Commodore (for whom he had a\nregard), he would risk nothing by importunity; and the fleet sailed\nfor the Straits of Magellan, without anybody being aware of what might\nbe the result of the court-martial.\n\nIt was about a fortnight after they had left the Falkland Islands,\nthat they entered the Straits. At first they had a leading wind which\ncarried them half through, but this did not last, and they then had to\ncontend not only against the wind, but against the current, and they\ndaily lost ground. The crews of the ships also began to sicken from\nfatigue and cold. Whether the Admiral had before made up his mind, or\nwhether, irritated by his fruitless endeavours to continue his voyage,\nit is impossible to say; but, after three weeks' useless struggle\nagainst the wind and currents, he hove-to and ordered all the captains\non board, when he proposed that the prisoner should receive his\npunishment--and that punishment was--_to be deserted_--that is, to be\nsent on shore with a day's food, where there was no means of obtaining\nsupport, so as to die miserably of hunger. This was a punishment\nfrequently resorted to by the Dutch at that period, as will be seen by\nreading an account of their voyages: but, at the same time, seldom, if\never, awarded to one of so high a rank as that of Commodore.\n\nPhilip immediately protested against it, and so did Krantz, although\nthey were both aware, that by so doing they would make the Admiral\ntheir enemy; but the other captains, who viewed both of them with a\njealous eye, and considered them as interlopers and interfering with\ntheir advancement, sided with the Admiral. Notwithstanding this\nmajority, Philip thought it his duty to expostulate.\n\n\"You know well, Admiral,\" said he, \"that I joined in his condemnation\nfor a breach of discipline: but, at the same time, there was much in\nextenuation. He committed a breach of discipline to save his ship's\ncompany, but not an error in judgment, as you yourself proved, by\ntaking the same measure to save your own men. Do not, therefore, visit\nan offence of so doubtful a nature with such cruelty. Let the Company\ndecide the point when you send him home, which you can do so soon\nas you arrive in India. He is sufficiently punished by losing his\ncommand: to do what you propose will be ascribed to feelings of\nrevenge more than to those of justice. What success can we deserve if\nwe commit an act of such cruelty; and how can we expect a merciful\nProvidence to protect us from the winds and waves when we are thus\nbarbarous towards each other?\"\n\nPhilip's arguments were of no avail. The Admiral ordered him to return\non board his ship, and had he been able to find an excuse, he would\nhave deprived him of his command. This he could not well do; but\nPhilip was aware that the Admiral was now his inveterate enemy. The\nCommodore was taken out of irons and brought into the cabin, and his\nsentence was made known to him.\n\n\"Be it so, Admiral,\" replied Avenhorn; \"for, to attempt to turn you\nfrom your purpose, I know would be unavailing. I am not punished for\ndisobedience of orders, but for having, by my disobedience, pointed\nout to you your duty--a duty which you were forced to perform\nafterwards by necessity. Then be it so; let me perish on these black\nrocks, as I shall, and my bones be whitened by the chilly blasts which\nhowl over their desolation. But mark me, cruel and vindictive man! I\nshall not be the only one whose bones will bleach there. I prophesy\nthat many others will share my fate, and even you, Admiral, _may_ be\nof the number,--if I mistake not, we shall lie side by side.\"\n\nThe Admiral made no reply, but gave a sign for the prisoner to be\nremoved. He then had a conference with the captains of the three\nsmaller vessels; and, as they had been all along retarded by the\nheavier sailing of his own ship and the _Dort_ commanded by Philip, he\ndecided that they should part company, and proceed on as fast as they\ncould to the Indies--sending on board of the two larger vessels all\nthe provisions they could spare, as they already began to run short.\n\nPhilip had left the cabin with Krantz after the prisoner had been\nremoved. He then wrote a few lines upon a slip of paper--\"Do not leave\nthe beach when you are put on shore, until the vessels are out of\nsight;\" and, requesting Krantz to find an opportunity to deliver this\nto the Commodore, he returned on board of his own ship.\n\nWhen the crew of the _Dort_ heard of the punishment about to be\ninflicted upon their old Commander, they were much excited. They felt\nthat he had sacrificed himself to save them, and they murmured much at\nthe cruelty of the Admiral.\n\nAbout an hour after Philip's return to his ship, the prisoner was sent\non shore and landed on the desolate and rocky coast, with a supply of\nprovisions for two days. Not a single article of extra clothing, or\nthe means of striking a light was permitted him. When the boat's keel\ngrazed the beach, he was ordered out. The boat shoved off, and the men\nwere not permitted even to bid him farewell.\n\nThe fleet, as Philip expected, remained hove-to, shifting the\nprovisions, and it was not till after dark that everything was\narranged. This opportunity was not lost. Philip was aware that it\nwould be considered a breach of discipline, but to that he was\nindifferent; neither did he think it likely that it would come to the\nears of the Admiral, as the crew of the _Dort_ were partial both to\nthe Commodore and to him. He had desired a seaman whom he could trust,\nto put into one of the boats a couple of muskets and a quantity of\nammunition, several blankets, and various other articles, besides\nprovisions for two or three months for one person, and, as soon as it\nwas dark, the men pulled on shore with the boat, found the Commodore\non the beach waiting for them, and supplied him with all these\nnecessaries. They then rejoined their ship, without the Admiral's\nhaving the least suspicion of what had been done, and shortly after\nthe fleet made sail on a wind, with their heads off shore. The next\nmorning, the three smaller vessels parted company, and by sunset had\ngained many miles to windward, after which they were not again seen.\n\nThe Admiral had sent for Philip to give him his instructions, which\nwere very severe, and evidently framed so as to be able to afford him\nhereafter some excuse for depriving him of his command. Among others,\nhis orders were, as the _Dort_ drew much less water than the Admiral's\nship, to sail ahead of him during the night, that, if they approached\ntoo near the land as they beat across the Channel, timely notice might\nbe given to the Admiral, if in too shallow water. This responsibility\nwas the occasion of Philip's being always on deck when they approached\nthe land of either side of the Straits. It was the second night after\nthe fleet had separated that Philip had been summoned on deck as they\nwere nearing the land of Terra del Fuego; he was watching the man in\nthe chains heaving the lead, when the officer of the watch reported\nto him that the Admiral's ship was ahead of them instead of astern.\nPhilip made enquiry as to when he passed, but could not discover; he\nwent forward, and saw the Admiral's ship with her poop-light, which,\nwhen the Admiral was astern, was not visible. \"What can be the\nAdmiral's reason for this?\" thought Philip; \"has he run ahead on\npurpose to make a charge against me of neglect of duty? it must be so.\nWell, let him do as he pleases; he must wait now till we arrive\nin India, for I shall not allow him to _desert_ me; and, with the\nCompany, I have as much, and I rather think, as a large proprietor,\nmore interest than he has. Well, as he has thought proper to go ahead,\nI have nothing to do but follow. 'You may come out of the chains\nthere.'\"\n\nPhilip went forward: they were now, as he imagined, very near to the\nland, but the night was dark and they could not distinguish it. For\nhalf an hour they continued their course, much to Philip's surprise,\nfor he now thought he could make out the loom of the land, dark as it\nwas. His eyes were constantly fixed upon the ship ahead, expecting\nevery minute that she would go about; but no, she continued her\ncourse, and Philip followed with his own vessel.\n\n\"We are very close to the land, sir,\" observed Vander Hagen, the\nlieutenant, who was the officer of the watch.\n\n\"So it appears to me: but the Admiral is closer, and draws much more\nwater than we do,\" replied Philip.\n\n\"I think I see the rocks on the beam to leeward, sir.\"\n\n\"I believe you are right,\" replied Philip: \"I cannot understand this.\nReady about, and get a gun ready--they must suppose us to be ahead of\nthem, depend upon it.\"\n\nHardly had Philip given the order, when the vessel struck heavily on\nthe rocks. Philip hastened aft; he found that the rudder had been\nunshipped, and the vessel was immovably fixed. His thoughts then\nreverted to the Admiral. \"Was he on shore?\" He ran forward, and the\nAdmiral was still sailing on, with his poop-light, about two cables'\nlength ahead of him.\n\n\"Fire the gun, there,\" cried Philip, perplexed beyond measure.\n\nThe gun was fired, and immediately followed up by the flash and report\nof another gun close astern of them. Philip looked with astonishment\nover the quarter and perceived the Admiral's ship close astern to him,\nand evidently on shore as well as his own.\n\n\"Merciful Heaven!\" exclaimed Philip, rushing forward, \"what can this\nbe?\" He beheld the other vessel with her light ahead, still sailing on\nand leaving them. The day was now dawning, and there was sufficient\nlight to make out the land. The _Dort_ was on shore not fifty yards\nfrom the beach, and surrounded by the high and barren rocks; yet the\nvessel ahead was apparently sailing on over the land. The seamen\ncrowded on the forecastle watching this strange phenomenon; at last it\nvanished from their sight.\n\n\"That's the _Flying Dutchman_, by all that's holy!\" cried one of the\nseamen, jumping off the gun.\n\nHardly had the man uttered these words when the vessel disappeared.\n\nPhilip felt convinced that it was so, and he walked away aft in a very\nperturbed state. It must have been his father's fatal ship which had\ndecoyed them to probable destruction. He hardly knew how to act. The\nAdmiral's wrath he did not wish, just at that moment, to encounter. He\nsent for the officer of the watch, and, having desired him to select\na crew for the boat, out of those men who had been on deck, and could\nsubstantiate his assertions, ordered him to go on board of the Admiral\nand state what had happened.\n\nAs soon as the boat had shoved off, Philip turned his attention to\nthe state of his own vessel. The daylight had increased, and Philip\nperceived that they were surrounded by rocks, and had run on shore\nbetween two reefs, which extended half a mile from the mainland. He\nsounded round his vessel, and discovered that she was fixed from\nforward to aft, and that, without lightening her, there was no chance\nof getting her off. He then turned to where the Admiral's ship lay\naground, and found that, to all appearance, she was in even a worse\nplight, as the rocks to leeward of her were above the water, and she\nwas much more exposed, should bad weather come on. Never, perhaps, was\nthere a scene more cheerless and appalling: a dark wintry sky--a sky\nloaded with heavy clouds--the wind cold and piercing--the whole\nline of the coast one mass of barren rocks, without the slightest\nappearance of vegetation; the inland part of the country presented\nan equally sombre appearance, and the higher points were capped with\nsnow, although it was not yet the winter season. Sweeping the coast\nwith his eye, Philip perceived, not four miles to leeward of them (so\nlittle progress had they made), the spot where they had _deserted_ the\nCommodore.\n\n\"Surely this has been a judgment on him for his cruelty,\" thought\nPhilip, \"and the prophecy of poor Avenhorn will come true--more bones\nthan his will bleach on those rocks.\" Philip turned round again to\nwhere the Admiral's ship was on shore, and started back, as he beheld\na sight even more dreadful than all that he had viewed--the body of\nVander Hagen, the officer sent on board of the Admiral, hanging at the\nmain-yard-arm. \"My God! is it possible?\" exclaimed Philip, stamping\nwith sorrow and indignation.\n\nHis boat was returning on board, and Philip awaited it with\nimpatience. The men hastened up the side, and breathlessly informed\nPhilip that the Admiral, as soon as he had heard the Lieutenant's\nreport, and his acknowledgment that he was officer of the watch, had\nordered him to be hung, and that he had sent them back with a summons\nfor him to repair on board immediately, and that they had seen another\nrope preparing at the other yard-arm.\n\n\"But not for you, sir,\" cried the men; \"that shall never be--you shall\nnot go on board--and we will defend you with our lives.\"\n\nThe whole ship's company joined in this resolution, and expressed\ntheir determination to resist the Admiral. Philip thanked them\nkindly--stated his intention of not going on board, and requested\nthat they would remain quiet, until it was ascertained what steps the\nAdmiral might take. He then went down to his cabin, to reflect upon\nwhat plan he should pursue. As he looked out of the stern-windows, and\nperceived the body of the young man still swinging in the wind, he\nalmost wished that he was in his place, for then there would be an end\nto his wayward fate: but he thought of Amine, and felt that, for her,\nhe wished to live. That the Phantom Ship should have decoyed him to\ndestruction was also a source of much painful feeling, and Philip\nmeditated, with his hands pressed to his temples. \"It is my destiny,\"\nthought he at last, \"and the will of Heaven must be done: we could not\nhave been so deceived if Heaven had not permitted it.\" And then his\nthoughts reverted to his present situation.\n\nThat the Admiral had exceeded his powers in taking the life of the\nofficer was undeniable, as, although his instructions gave him power\nof life and death, still it was only to be decided by the sentence of\nthe court-martial held by the captains commanding the vessels of the\nfleet; he therefore felt himself justified in resistance. But Philip\nwas troubled with the idea that such resistance might lead to much\nbloodshed; and he was still debating how to act, when they reported to\nhim that there was a boat coming from the Admiral's ship. Philip went\nupon deck to receive the officer, who stated that it was the Admiral's\norder that he should immediately come on board, and that he must\nconsider himself now under arrest, and deliver up his sword.\n\n\"No! no!\" exclaimed the ship's company of the _Dort_. He shall not go\non board. We will stand by our Captain to the last.\"\n\n\"Silence, men! silence!\" cried Philip. \"You must be aware, sir,\" said\nhe to the officer, \"that in the cruel punishment of that innocent\nyoung man, the Admiral has exceeded his powers: and, much as I\nregret to see any symptoms of mutiny and insubordination, it must be\nremembered that, if those in command disobey the orders they have\nreceived, by exceeding them, they not only set the example, but give\nan excuse for those who otherwise would be bound to obey them, to do\nthe same. Tell the Admiral that his murder of that innocent man has\ndetermined me no longer to consider myself under his authority, and\nthat I will hold myself, as well as him, answerable to the Company\nwhom we serve, for our conduct. I do not intend to go on board and\nput myself in his power, that he might gratify his resentment by my\nignominious death. It is a duty that I owe these men under my command\nto preserve my life, that I may, if possible, preserve theirs in this\nstrait; and you may also add, that a little reflection must point out\nto him that this is no time for us to war with, but to assist each\nother with all our energies. We are here, ship-wrecked on a barren\ncoast, with provisions insufficient for any lengthened stay, no\nprospect of succour, and little of escape. As the Commodore truly\nprophesied, many more are likely to perish as well as him--and even\nthe Admiral himself may be of the number. I shall wait his answer;\nif he choose to lay aside all animosity, and refer our conduct to\na higher tribunal, I am willing to join with him in rendering that\nassistance to each other which our situation requires--if not, you\nmust perceive, and of course will tell him, that I have those with me\nwho will defend me against any attempt at force. You have my answer,\nsir, and may go on board.\"\n\nThe officer went to the gangway, but found that none of his crew,\nexcept the bowman, were in the boat; they had gone up to gain from the\nmen of the _Dort_ the true history of what they had but imperfectly\nheard: and, before they were summoned to return, had received full\nintelligence. They coincided with the seamen of the _Dort_, that the\nappearance of the Phantom Ship, which had occasioned their present\ndisaster, was a judgment upon the Admiral, for his conduct in having\nso cruelly _deserted_ the poor Commodore.\n\nUpon the return of the officer with Philip's answer, the rage of the\nAdmiral was beyond all bounds. He ordered the guns aft, which would\nbear upon the _Dort_, to be double-shotted, and fired into her; but\nKrantz pointed out to him that they could not bring more guns to bear\nupon the _Dort_, in their present situation, than the _Dort_\ncould bring to bear upon them; that their superior force was thus\nneutralised, and that no advantage could result from taking such a\nstep. The Admiral immediately put Krantz under arrest, and proceeded\nto put into execution his insane intentions. In this he was, however,\nprevented by the seamen of the _Lion_, who neither wished to fire upon\ntheir consort, nor to be fired at in return. The report of the boat's\ncrew had been circulated through the ship, and the men felt too much\nill-will against the Admiral, and perceived at the same time the\nextreme difficulty of their situation, to wish to make it worse. They\ndid not proceed to open mutiny, but they went down below, and when\nthe officers ordered them up, they refused to go upon deck; and the\nofficers, who were equally disgusted with the Admiral's conduct,\nmerely informed him of the state of the ship's company, without\nnaming individuals, so as to excite his resentment against any one\nin particular. Such was the state of affairs when the sun went down.\nNothing had been done on board the Admiral's ship, for Krantz was\nunder arrest, and the Admiral had retired in a state of fury to his\ncabin.\n\nIn the meantime Philip and the ship's company had not been idle--they\nhad laid an anchor out astern, and hove taut: they had started all\nthe water, and were pumping it out, when a boat pulled alongside, and\nKrantz made his appearance on deck.\n\n\"Captain Vanderdecken, I have come to put myself under your orders, if\nyou will receive me--if not, render me your protection; for, as\nsure as fate, I should have been hanged to-morrow morning, if I had\nremained in my own ship. The men in the boat have come with the same\nintention--that of joining you, if you will permit them.\"\n\nAlthough Philip would have wished it had been otherwise, he could not\nwell refuse to receive Krantz, under the circumstances of the case. He\nwas very partial to him, and to save his life, which certainly was in\ndanger, he would have done much more. He desired that the boat's crew\nshould return; but when Krantz had stated to him what had occurred on\nboard the _Lion_, and the crew earnestly begged him not to send them\nback to almost certain death, which their having effected the escape\nof Krantz would have assured, Philip reluctantly allowed them to\nremain.\n\nThe night was tempestuous, but the wind being now off shore, the water\nwas not rough. The crew of the _Dort_, under the directions of Philip\nand Krantz, succeeded in lightening the vessel so much during the\nnight that the next morning they were able to haul her off, and found\nthat her bottom had received no serious injury. It was fortunate for\nthem that they had not discontinued their exertions, for the wind\nshifted a few hours before sunrise, and by the time that they had\nshipped their rudder, it came on to blow fresh down the Straits, the\nwind being accompanied with a heavy swell.\n\nThe Admiral's ship still lay aground, and apparently no exertions were\nused to get her off. Philip was much puzzled how to act: leave the\ncrew of the _Lion_ he could not; nor indeed could he refuse, or did he\nwish to refuse the Admiral, if he proposed coming on board; but he now\nmade up his mind that it should only be as a passenger, and that he\nwould himself retain the command. At present he contented himself with\ndropping his anchor outside, clear of the reef, where he was sheltered\nby a bluff cape, under which the water was smooth, about a mile\ndistant from where the Admiral's ship lay on shore; and he employed\nhis crew in replenishing his water-casks from a rivulet close to where\nthe ship was anchored. He waited to see if the other vessel got off,\nbeing convinced that if she did not some communication must soon take\nplace. As soon as the water was complete, he sent one of the boats to\nthe place where the Commodore had been landed, having resolved to take\nhim on board, if they could find him; but the boat returned without\nhaving seen anything of him, although the men had clambered over the\nhills to a considerable distance.\n\nOn the second morning after Philip had hauled his vessel off, they\nobserved that the boats of the Admiral's ship were passing and\nrepassing from the shore, landing her stores and provisions; and the\nnext day, from the tents pitched on shore, it was evident that she was\nabandoned, although the boats were still employed in taking articles\nout of her. That night it blew fresh, and the sea was heavy; the next\nmorning her masts were gone, and she turned on her broadside; she was\nevidently a wreck, and Philip now consulted with Krantz how to act. To\nleave the crew of the _Lion_ on shore was impossible: they must all\nperish when the winter set in upon such a desolate coast. On the\nwhole, it was considered advisable that the first communication should\ncome from the other party, and Philip resolved to remain quietly at\nanchor.\n\nIt was very plain that there was no longer any subordination among the\ncrew of the _Lion_, who were to be seen, in the day-time, climbing\nover the rocks in every direction, and at night, when their large\nfires were lighted, carousing and drinking. This waste of provisions\nwas a subject of much vexation to Philip. He had not more than\nsufficient for his own crew, and he took it for granted that, so soon\nas what they had taken on shore should be expended, the crew of the\n_Lion_ would ask to be received on board of the _Dort_.\n\nFor more than a week did affairs continue in this state, when, one\nmorning, a boat was seen pulling towards the ship, and, in the\nstern-sheets Philip recognised the officer who had been sent on board\nto put him under arrest. When the officer came on deck, he took off\nhis hat to Philip.\n\n\"You do, then, acknowledge me as in command,\" observed Philip.\n\n\"Yes, sir, most certainly; you were second in command, but now you are\nfirst--for the Admiral is dead.\"\n\n\"Dead!\" exclaimed Philip; \"and how?\"\n\n\"He was found dead on the beach, under a high cliff, and the body\nof the Commodore was in his arms; indeed, they were both grappled\ntogether. It is supposed, that in his walk up to the top of the hill,\nwhich he used to take every day, to see if any vessels might be in\nthe Straits, he fell in with the Commodore--that they had come to\ncontention, and had both fallen over the precipice together. No one\nsaw the meeting, but they must have fallen over the rocks, as the\nbodies are dreadfully mangled.\"\n\nOn inquiry, Philip ascertained that all chance of saving the _Lion_\nhad been lost after the second night, when she had beat in her\nlarboard streak, and had six feet of water in the hold--that the crew\nhad been very insubordinate, and had consumed almost all the spirits;\nand that not only all the sick had already perished, but also\nmany others who had either fallen over the rocks when they were\nintoxicated, or had been found dead in the morning, from their\nexposure during the night.\n\n\"Then the poor Commodore's prophecy has been fulfilled!\" observed\nPhilip to Krantz. \"Many others, and even the Admiral himself, have\nperished with him--peace be with them! And now let us get away from\nthis horrible place as soon as possible.\"\n\nPhilip then gave orders to the officer to collect his men, and the\nprovisions that remained, for immediate embarkation. Krantz followed\nsoon after with all the boats, and before night everything was on\nboard. The bodies of the Admiral and Commodore were buried where they\nlay, and the next morning the _Dort_ was under weigh, and, with a\nslanting wind, was laying a fair course through the Straits.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIX\n\n\nIt appeared as if their misfortunes were to cease, after the tragical\ndeath of the two commanders. In a few days, the _Dort_ had passed\nthrough the Straits of Magellan, and was sailing in the Pacific Ocean,\nwith a blue sky and quiet sea. The ship's company recovered their\nhealth and spirits, and the vessel being now well manned, the duty was\ncarried on with cheerfulness.\n\nIn about a fortnight, they had gained well up on the Spanish coast,\nbut although they had seen many of the inhabitants on the beach, they\nhad not fallen in with any vessels belonging to the Spaniards. Aware\nthat if he met with a Spanish ship of superior force it would attack\nhim, Philip had made every preparation, and had trained his men to the\nguns. He had now, with the joint crews of the vessels, a well-manned\nship, and the anticipation of prize-money had made his men very eager\nto fall in with some Spaniard, which they knew that Philip would\ncapture if he could. Light winds and calms detained them for a month\non the coast, when Philip determined upon running for the Isle St\nMarie, where, though he knew it was in possession of the Spaniards, he\nyet hoped to be able to procure refreshments for the ship's company,\neither by fair means or by force. The _Dort_ was, by their reckoning,\nabout thirty miles from the island, and having run in until after\ndark, they had hove-to till the next morning. Krantz was on deck;\nhe leant over the side, and as the sails flapped to the masts, he\nattempted to define the line of the horizon. It was very dark, but as\nhe watched, he thought that he perceived a light for a moment, and\nwhich then disappeared. Fixing his eyes on the spot, he soon made out\na vessel, hove-to, and not two cables' length distant. He hastened\ndown to apprise Philip, and procure a glass. By the time Philip was\non deck, the vessel had been distinctly made out to be a three-masted\nxebeque, very low in the water. After a short consultation, it was\nagreed that the boats on the quarter should be lowered down, and\nmanned and armed without noise, and that they should steal gently\nalongside and surprise her. The men were called up, silence enjoined,\nand in a few minutes the boats' crew had possession of the vessel;\nhaving boarded her and secured the hatches before the alarm could be\ngiven by the few who were on deck. More men were then taken on board\nby Krantz, who, as agreed upon, lay to under the lee of the _Dort_\nuntil the daylight made its appearance. The hatches were then taken\noff, and the prisoners sent on board of the _Dort_. There were sixty\npeople on board, a large number for a vessel of that description.\n\nOn being interrogated, two of the prisoners, who were well-dressed and\ngentlemanlike persons, stepped forward and stated that the vessel was\nfrom St Mary's, bound to Lima, with a cargo of flour and passengers;\nthat the crew and captain consisted of twenty-five men, and all the\nrest who were on board, had taken that opportunity of going to Lima.\nThat they themselves were among the passengers, and trusted that the\nvessel and cargo would be immediately released, as the two nations\nwere not at war.\n\n\"Not at war at home, I grant,\" replied Philip, \"but in these seas, the\nconstant aggressions of your armed ships compel me to retaliate, and\nI shall therefore make a prize of your vessel and cargo. At the same\ntime, as I have no wish to molest private individuals, I will land all\nthe passengers and crew at St Mary's, to which place I am bound in\norder to obtain refreshments, which now I shall expect will be given\ncheerfully as your ransom, so as to relieve me from resorting to\nforce.\" The prisoners protested strongly against this, but without\navail. They then requested leave to ransom the vessel and cargo,\noffering a larger sum than they both appeared to be worth; but Philip,\nbeing short of provisions, refused to part with the cargo, and the\nSpaniards appeared much disappointed at the unsuccessful issue of\ntheir request. Finding that nothing would induce him to part with the\nprovisions, they then begged hard to ransom the vessel; and to this,\nafter a consultation with Krantz, Philip gave his assent. The two\nvessels then made sail, and steered on for the island, then about four\nleagues distant. Although Philip had not wished to retain the vessel,\nyet, as they stood in together, her superior speed became so manifest\nthat he almost repented that he had agreed to ransom her.\n\nAt noon, the _Dort_ was anchored in the roads, out of gunshot, and a\nportion of the passengers allowed to go on shore and make arrangements\nfor the ransom of the remainder, while the prize was hauled alongside,\nand her cargo hoisted into the ship. Towards evening, three large\nboats with live stock and vegetables and the sum agreed upon for the\nransom of the xebeque, came alongside; and as soon as one of the boats\nwas cleared, the prisoners were permitted to go on shore in it, with\nthe exception of the Spanish pilot, who, at the suggestion of Krantz,\nwas retained, with a promise of being released directly the _Dort_ was\nclear of the Spanish seas. A negro slave was also, at his own\nrequest, allowed to remain on board, much to the annoyance of the two\npassengers before mentioned, who claimed the man as their property,\nand insisted that it was an infraction of the agreement which had been\nentered into. \"You prove my right by your own words,\" replied Philip;\n\"I agreed to deliver up all the passengers, but no _property_; the\nslave will remain on board.\"\n\nFinding their endeavours ineffectual, the Spaniards took a haughty\nleave. The _Dort_ remained at anchor that night to examine her\nrigging, and the next morning they discovered that the xebeque had\ndisappeared, having sailed unperceived by them during the night.\n\nAs soon as the anchor was up and sail made on the ship, Philip went\ndown to his cabin with Krantz, to consult as to their best course.\nThey were followed by the negro slave, who, shutting the door and\nlooking watchfully round, said that he wished to speak with them. His\ninformation was most important, but given rather too late. The vessel\nwhich had been ransomed was a government advice-boat, the fastest\nsailer the Spaniards possessed. The two pretended passengers were\nofficers of the Spanish navy, and the others were the crew of the\nvessel. She had been sent down to collect the bullion and take it\nto Lima, and at the same time to watch for the arrival of the Dutch\nfleet, intelligence of whose sailing had been some time before\nreceived overland. When the Dutch fleet made its appearance, she\nwas to return to Lima with the news, and a Spanish force would be\ndespatched against it. They further learnt that some of the supposed\ncasks of flour contained 2000 gold doubloons each, others bars of\nsilver; this precaution having been taken in case of capture. That the\nvessel had now sailed for Lima there was no doubt. The reason why\nthe Spaniards were so anxious not to leave the negro on board of the\n_Dort_, was, that they knew that he would disclose what he now had\ndone. As for the pilot, he was a man whom the Spaniards knew they\ncould trust, and for that reason they had better be careful of him, or\nhe would lead the _Dort_ into some difficulty.\n\nPhilip now repented that he had ransomed the vessel, as he would, in\nall probability, have to meet and cope with a superior force, before\nhe could make his way clear out of these seas; but there was no help\nfor it. He consulted with Krantz, and it was agreed that they should\nsend for the ship's company and make them acquainted with these facts;\narguing that a knowledge of the valuable capture which they had made,\nwould induce the men to fight well, and stimulate them with the hopes\nof further success. The ship's company heard the intelligence with\ndelight, professed themselves ready to meet double their force, and\nthen, by the directions of Philip, the casks were brought up on the\nquarter-deck, opened, and the bullion taken out. The whole, when\ncollected, amounted to about half a million of dollars, as near as\nthey could estimate it, and a distribution of the coined money was\nmade from the capstan the very next day; the bars of metal being\nreserved until they could be sold, and their value ascertained.\n\nFor six weeks Philip worked his vessel up the coast, without\nfalling in with any vessel under sail. Notice had been given by the\nadvice-boat, as it appeared, and every craft, large and small, was at\nanchor under the batteries. They had nearly run up the whole coast,\nand Philip had determined that the next day he would stretch across to\nBatavia, when a ship was seen in-shore under a press of sail, running\ntowards Lima. Chase was immediately given, but the water shoaled,\nand the pilot was asked if they could stand on. He replied in the\naffirmative, stating that they were now in the shallowest water, and\nthat it was deeper within. The leadsman was ordered into the chains,\nbut at the first heave the lead-line broke; another was sent for, and\nthe _Dort_ still carried on under a heavy press of sail. Just then,\nthe negro slave went up to Philip, and told him that he had seen the\npilot with his knife in the chains, and that he thought he must have\ncut the lead-line so far through as to occasion it being carried away,\nand told Philip not to trust him. The helm was immediately put down;\nbut as the ship went round she touched on the bank, dragged, and was\nagain clear.--\"Scoundrel!\" cried Philip. \"So you cut the lead-line?\nThe negro saw you, and has saved us.\"\n\nThe Spaniard leaped down from off the gun, and, before he could be\nprevented, had buried his knife in the heart of the negro. \"Maldetto,\ntake that for your pains!\" cried he, in a fury, grinding his teeth and\nflourishing his knife.\n\nThe negro fell dead. The pilot was seized and disarmed by the crew\nof the _Dort_, who were partial to the negro, as it was from his\ninformation that they had become rich.\n\n\"Let them do with him as they please,\" said Krantz to Philip.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Philip; \"summary justice.\"\n\nThe crew debated a few minutes, and then lashed the pilot to the\nnegro, and carried him off to the taffrail. There was a heavy plunge,\nand he disappeared under the eddying waters in the wake of the vessel.\n\nPhilip now determined to shape his course for Batavia. He was within a\nfew days' sail of Lima, and had every reason to believe that vessels\nhad been sent out to intercept him. With a favourable wind he now\nstood away from the coast, and for three days made a rapid passage.\nOn the fourth, at daylight, two vessels appeared to windward, bearing\ndown upon him. That they were large armed vessels was evident; and the\ndisplay of Spanish ensigns and pennants, as they rounded to, about a\nmile to windward, soon showed that they were enemies. They proved\nto be a frigate of a larger size than the _Dort_, and a corvette of\ntwenty-two guns.\n\nThe crew of the _Dort_ showed no alarm at this disparity of force:\nthey clinked their doubloons in their pockets; vowed not to return\nthem to their lawful owners, if they could help it; and flew with\nalacrity to their guns. The Dutch ensign was displayed in defiance,\nand the two Spanish vessels, again putting their heads towards the\n_Dort_, that they might lessen their distance, received some raking\nshot, which somewhat discomposed them; but they rounded to at a\ncable's length, and commenced the action with great spirit, the\nfrigate lying on the beam, and the corvette on the bow of Philip's\nvessel. After half an hour's determined exchange of broadsides, the\nforemast of the Spanish frigate fell, carrying away with it the\nmaintop-mast; and this accident impeded her firing. The _Dort_\nimmediately made sail, stood on to the corvette, which she crippled\nwith three or four broadsides, then tacked, and fetched alongside of\nthe frigate, whose lee-guns were still impeded with the wreck of the\nforemast. The two vessels now lay head and stern, within ten feet of\neach other, and the action recommenced to the disadvantage of the\nSpaniard. In a quarter of an hour the canvas, hanging overside, caught\nfire from the discharge of the guns, and very soon communicated to the\nship, the _Dort_ still pouring in a most destructive broadside, which\ncould not be effectually returned. After every attempt to extinguish\nthe flames, the captain of the Spanish vessel resolved that both\nvessels should share the same fate. He put his helm up, and, running\nher on to the _Dort_, grappled with her, and attempted to secure\nthe two vessels together. Then raged the conflict; the Spaniards\nattempting to pass their grappling-chains so as to prevent the escape\nof their enemy, and the Dutch endeavouring to frustrate their attempt.\nThe chains and sides of both vessels were crowded with men fighting\ndesperately; those struck down falling between the two vessels, which\nthe wreck of the foremast still prevented from coming into actual\ncollision. During this conflict, Philip and Krantz were not idle.\nBy squaring the after-yards, and putting all sail on forward they\ncontrived that the _Dort_ should pay off before the wind with her\nantagonist, and by this manoeuvre they cleared themselves of the smoke\nwhich so incommoded them; and, having good way on the two vessels,\nthey then rounded to so as to get on the other tack, and bring the\nSpaniard to leeward. This gave them a manifest advantage, and soon\nterminated the conflict. The smoke and flames were beat back on the\nSpanish vessel--the fire which had communicated to the _Dort_ was\nextinguished--the Spaniards were no longer able to prosecute their\nendeavours to fasten the two vessels together, and retreated to within\nthe bulwarks of their own vessel; and, after great exertions, the\n_Dort_ was disengaged, and forged ahead of her opponent, who was soon\nenveloped in a sheet of flame. The corvette remained a few cables'\nlength to windward, occasionally firing a gun. Philip poured in a\nbroadside, and she hauled down her colours. The action might now be\nconsidered at an end, and the object was to save the crew of the\nburning frigate. The boats of the _Dort_ were hoisted out, but only\ntwo of them could swim. One of them was immediately despatched to the\ncorvette, with orders for her to send all her boats to the assistance\nof the frigate, which was done, and the major part of the surviving\ncrew were saved. For two hours the guns of the frigate, as they were\nheated by the flames, discharged themselves; and then, the fire having\ncommunicated to the magazine, she blew up, and the remainder of her\nhull sank slowly and disappeared. Among the prisoners in the uniform\nof the Spanish service Philip perceived the two pretended passengers,\nthis proving the correctness of the negro's statement. The two\nmen-of-war had been sent out of Lima on purpose to intercept him,\nanticipating, with such a preponderating force, an easy victory. After\nsome consultation with Krantz, Philip agreed that, as the corvette was\nin such a crippled state, and the nations were not actually at war,\nit would be advisable to release her with all the prisoners. This was\ndone, and the _Dort_ again made sail for Batavia, and anchored in\nthe roads three weeks after the combat had taken place. He found the\nremainder of the fleet, which had been despatched before them, and had\narrived there some weeks, had taken in their cargoes, and were\nready to sail for Holland. Philip wrote his despatches, in which he\ncommunicated to the directors the events of the voyage; and then went\non shore, to reside at the house of the merchant who had formerly\nreceived him, until the _Dort_ could be freighted for her voyage home.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XX\n\n\nWe must return to Amine, who is seated on the mossy bank where she and\nPhilip conversed when they were interrupted by Schriften the pilot.\nShe is in deep thought, with her eyes cast down, as if trying to\nrecall the past. \"Alas! for my mother's power,\" exclaimed she; \"but it\nis gone--gone for ever! This torment and suspense I cannot bear--those\nfoolish priests too!\" And Amine rose from the bank and walked towards\nher cottage.\n\nFather Mathias had not returned to Lisbon. At first he had not found\nan opportunity, and afterwards, his debt of gratitude towards Philip\ninduced him to remain by Amine, who appeared each day to hold more in\naversion the tenets of the Christian faith. Many and many were the\nconsultations with Father Seysen, many were the exhortations of both\nthe good old men to Amine, who, at times, would listen without reply,\nand at others, argue boldly against them. It appeared to them that she\nrejected their religion with an obstinacy as unpardonable as it was\nincomprehensible. But to her the case was more simple: she refused to\nbelieve, she said, that which she could not understand. She went so\nfar as to acknowledge the beauty of the principles, the purity of the\ndoctrine; but when the good priests would enter into the articles of\ntheir faith, Amine would either shake her head or attempt to turn\nthe conversation. This only increased the anxiety of the good Father\nMathias to convert and save the soul of one so young and beautiful;\nand he now no longer thought of returning to Lisbon, but devoted his\nwhole time to the instruction of Amine, who, wearied by his incessant\nimportunities, almost loathed his presence.\n\nUpon reflection, it will not appear surprising that Amine rejected a\ncreed so dissonant to her wishes and intentions. The human mind is of\nthat proud nature, that it requires all its humility to be called into\naction before it will bow, even to the Deity.\n\nAmine knew that her mother had possessed superior knowledge, and an\nintimacy with unearthly intelligences. She had seen her practise her\nart with success, although so young at the time that she could not now\ncall to mind the mystic preparations by which her mother had succeeded\nin her wishes; and it was now that her thoughts were wholly bent upon\nrecovering what she had forgotten, that Father Mathias was exhorting\nher to a creed which positively forbade even the attempt. The peculiar\nand awful mission of her husband strengthened her opinion in the\nlawfulness of calling in the aid of supernatural agencies; and the\narguments brought forward by these worthy, but not over-talented,\nprofessors of the Christian creed, had but little effect upon a mind\nso strong and so decided as that of Amine--a mind which, bent as it\nwas upon one object, rejected with scorn tenets, in proof of which\nthey could offer no visible manifestation, and which would have bound\nher blindly to believe what appeared to her contrary to common sense.\nThat her mother's art could bring evidence of _its_ truth she had\nalready shown, and satisfied herself in the effect of the dream\nwhich she had proved upon Philip;--but what proof could they bring\nforward?--Records--_which they would not permit her to read_!\n\n\"Oh! that I had my mother's art,\" repeated Amine once more, as she\nentered the cottage; \"then would I know where my Philip was at this\nmoment. Oh! for the black mirror in which I used to peer at her\ncommand, and tell her what passed in array before me. How well do I\nremember that time--the time of my father's absence, when I looked\ninto the liquid on the palm of my hand, and told her of the Bedouin\ncamp--of the skirmish--the horse without a rider--and the turban on\nthe sand!\" And again Amine fell into deep thought. \"Yes,\" cried she,\nafter a time, \"thou canst assist me, mother! Give me in a dream thy\nknowledge; thy daughter begs it as a boon. Let me think again. The\nword--what was the word? what was the name of the spirit--Turshoon?\nYes, methinks it was Turshoon. Mother! mother! help your daughter.\"\n\n\"Dost thou call upon the Blessed Virgin, my child?\" said Father\nMathias, who had entered the room as she pronounced the last words.\n\"If so, thou dost well, for she may appear to thee in thy dreams, and\nstrengthen thee in the true faith.\"\n\n\"I called upon my own mother, who is in the land of spirits, good\nfather,\" replied Amine.\n\n\"Yes; but, as an infidel; not, I fear, in the land of the blessed\nspirits, my child.\"\n\n\"She hardly will be punished for following the creed of her fathers,\nliving where she did, where no other creed was known?\" replied Amine,\nindignantly. \"If the good on earth are blessed in the next world--if\nshe had, as you assert she had, a soul to be saved--an immortal\nspirit--He who made that spirit will not destroy it because she\nworshipped as her fathers did.--Her life was good: why should she\nbe punished for ignorance of that creed which she never had an\nopportunity of rejecting?\"\n\n\"Who shall dispute the will of Heaven, my child? Be thankful that you\nare permitted to be instructed, and to be received into the bosom of\nthe holy church.\"\n\n\"I am thankful for many things, father; but I am weary, and must wish\nyou a good-night.\"\n\nAmine retired to her room--but not to sleep. Once more did she attempt\nthe ceremonies used by her mother, changing them each time, as\ndoubtful of her success. Again the censer was lighted--the charm\nessayed; again the room was filled with smoke as she threw in the\nvarious herbs which she had knowledge of, for all the papers thrown\naside at her father's death had been carefully collected, and on many\nwere directions found as to the use of those herbs. \"The word! the\nword! I have the first--the second word! Help me, mother!\" cried\nAmine, as she sat by the side of the bed, in the room, which was now\nso full of smoke that nothing could be distinguished. \"It is of no\nuse,\" thought she at last, letting her hands fall at her side; \"I have\nforgotten the art. Mother! mother! help me in my dreams this night.\"\n\nThe smoke gradually cleared away, and, when Amine lifted up her eyes,\nshe perceived a figure standing before her. At first she thought she\nhad been successful in her charm; but, as the figure became more\ndistinct, she perceived that it was Father Mathias, who was looking at\nher with a severe frown and contracted brow, his arms folded before\nhim.\n\n\"Unholy child! what dost thou?\"\n\nAmine had roused the suspicions of the priests, not only by her\nconversation, but by several attempts which she had before made to\nrecover her lost art; and on one occasion, in which she had defended\nit, both Father Mathias and Father Seysen had poured out the bitterest\nanathemas upon her, or anyone who had resort to such practices. The\nsmell of the fragrant herbs thrown into the censer, and the smoke,\nwhich afterwards had escaped through the door and ascended the stairs,\nhad awakened the suspicions of Father Mathias, and he had crept up\nsilently, and entered the room without her perceiving it. Amine at\nonce perceived her danger. Had she been single, she would have dared\nthe priest; but, for Philip's sake, she determined to mislead him.\n\n\"I do no wrong, father,\" replied she, calmly; \"but it appears to me\nnot seemly that you should enter the chamber of a young woman during\nher husband's absence. I might have been in my bed. It is a strange\nintrusion.\"\n\n\"Thou canst not mean this, woman! My age--my profession--are a\nsufficient warranty,\" replied Father Mathias, somewhat confused at\nthis unexpected attack.\n\n\"Not always, Father, if what I have been told of monks and priests\nbe true,\" replied Amine. \"I ask again, why comest thou here into an\nunprotected woman's chamber?\"\n\n\"Because I felt convinced that she was practising unholy arts.\"\n\n\"Unholy arts!--what mean you? Is the leech's skill unholy? is it\nunholy to administer relief to those who suffer?--to charm the\nfever and the ague which rack the limbs of those who live in this\nunwholesome climate?\"\n\n\"All charms are most unholy.\"\n\n\"When I said charms, Father, I meant not what you mean; I simply would\nhave said a remedy. If a knowledge of certain wonderful herbs,\nwhich, properly combined will form a specific to ease the suffering\nwretch--an art well known unto my mother, and which I now would fain\nrecall--if that knowledge, or a wish to regain that knowledge, be\nunholy, then are you correct.\"\n\n\"I heard thee call upon thy mother for her help.\"\n\n\"I did, for she well knew the ingredients; but I, I fear have not the\nknowledge that she had. Is that sinful, good Father?\"\n\n\"'Tis, then, a remedy that you would find?\" replied the priest; \"I\nthought that thou didst practise that which is most unlawful.\"\n\n\"Can the burning of a few weeds be then unlawful? What did you expect\nto find? Look you, Father, at these ashes--they may, with oil, be\nrubbed into the pores and give relief--but can they do more? What do\nyou expect from them--a ghost?--a spirit?--like the prophet raised for\nthe King of Israel?\" And Amine laughed aloud.\n\n\"I am perplexed, but not convinced,\" replied the priest.\n\n\"I, too, am perplexed and not convinced,\" responded Amine, scornfully.\n\"I cannot satisfy myself that a man of your discretion could really\nsuppose that there was mischief in burning weeds; nor am I convinced\nthat such was the occasion of your visit at this hour of the night to\na lone woman's chamber. There may be natural charms more powerful than\nthose you call supernatural. I pray you, Father, leave this chamber.\nIt is not seemly. Should you again presume, you leave the house. I\nthought better of you. In future, I will not be left at any time\nalone.\"\n\nThis attack of Amine's upon the reputation of the old priest was too\nsevere. Father Mathias immediately quitted the room, saying, as he\nwent out, \"May God forgive you for your false suspicions and great\ninjustice! I came here for the cause I have stated, and no more.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" soliloquised Amine, as the door closed, \"I know you did; but I\nmust rid myself of your unwelcome company. I will have no spy upon my\nactions--no meddler to thwart me in my will. In your zeal you have\ncommitted yourself, and I will take the advantage you have given me.\nIs not the privacy of a woman's chamber to be held sacred by you\nsacred men? In return for assistance in distress--for food and\nshelter--you would become a spy. How grateful, and how worthy of the\ncreed which you profess!\" Amine opened her door as soon as she had\nremoved the censer, and summoned one of the women of the house to\nstay that night in her room, stating that the priest had entered her\nchamber, and she did not like the intrusion.\n\n\"Holy father! is it possible?\" replied the woman.\n\nAmine made no reply, but went to bed; but Father Mathias heard all\nthat passed as he paced the room below. The next day he called upon\nFather Seysen, and communicated to him what had occurred, and the\nfalse suspicions of Amine.\n\n\"You have acted hastily,\" replied Father Seysen, \"to visit a woman's\nchamber at such an hour of the night.\"\n\n\"I had my suspicions, good Father Seysen.\"\n\n\"And she will have hers. She is young and beautiful.\"\n\n\"Now, by the Blessed Virgin--\"\n\n\"I absolve you, good Mathias,\" replied Father Seysen; \"but still, if\nknown, it would occasion much scandal to our church.\"\n\nAnd known it soon was; for the woman who had been summoned by Amine\ndid not fail to mention the circumstance; and Father Mathias found\nhimself everywhere so coldly received, and, besides, so ill at ease\nwith himself, that he very soon afterwards quitted the country, and\nreturned to Lisbon; angry with himself for his imprudence, but still\nmore angry with Amine for her unjust suspicions.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXI\n\n\nThe cargo of the _Dort_ was soon ready, and Philip sailed and arrived\nat Amsterdam without any further adventure. That he reached his\ncottage, and was received with delight by Amine, need hardly be said.\nShe had been expecting him; for the two ships of the squadron, which\nhad sailed on his arrival at Batavia, and which had charge of his\ndespatches, had, of course, carried letters to her from Philip, the\nfirst letters she had ever received from him during his voyages. Six\nweeks after the letters Philip himself made his appearance, and Amine\nwas happy. The directors were, of course, highly satisfied with\nPhilip's conduct, and he was appointed to the command of a large armed\nship, which was to proceed to India in the spring, and one-third of\nwhich, according to agreement, was purchased by Philip out of the\nfunds which he had in the hands of the Company. He had now five months\nof quiet and repose to pass away, previous to his once more trusting\nto the elements; and this time, as it was agreed, he had to make\narrangements on board for the reception of Amine.\n\nAmine narrated to Philip what had occurred between her and the priest\nMathias, and by what means she had rid herself of his unwished-for\nsurveillance.\n\n\"And were you practising your mother's arts, Amine?\"\n\n\"Nay, not practising them, for I could not recall them, but I was\ntrying to recover them.\"\n\n\"Why so, Amine? this must not be. It is, as the good father said,\n'unholy.' Promise me you will abandon them, now and for ever.\"\n\n\"If that act be unholy, Philip, so is your mission. You would deal\nand co-operate with the spirits of another world--I would do no more.\nAbandon your terrific mission--abandon your seeking after disembodied\nspirits--stay at home with your Amine, and she will cheerfully comply\nwith your request.\"\n\n\"Mine is an awful summons from the Most High.\"\n\n\"Then the Most High permits your communion with those who are not of\nthis world?\"\n\n\"He does; you know even the priests do not gainsay it, although they\nshudder at the very thought.\"\n\n\"If then He permits to one, He will to another; nay, aught that I can\ndo is but with His permission.\"\n\n\"Yes, Amine, so does He permit evil to stalk on the earth, but He\ncountenances it not.\"\n\n\"He countenances your seeking after your doomed father, your attempts\nto meet him; nay, more, He commands it. If you are thus permitted, why\nmay not I be? I am your wife, a portion of yourself; and when I am\nleft over a desolate hearth, while you pursue your course of danger,\nmay not I appeal also to the immaterial world to give me that\nintelligence which will soothe my sorrow, lighten my burden, and\nwhich, at the same time, can hurt no living creature? Did I attempt to\npractise these arts for evil purposes, it were just to deny them me,\nand wrong to continue them; but I would but follow in the steps of my\nhusband, and seek as he seeks, with a good intent.\"\n\n\"But it is contrary to our faith.\"\n\n\"Have the priests declared your mission contrary to their faith? or,\nif they have, have they not been convinced to the contrary, and been\nawed to silence? But why argue, my dear Philip? Shall I not now be\nwith you? and while with you I will attempt no more. You have my\npromise; but if separated, I will not say, but I shall then require of\nthe invisible a knowledge of my husband's motions, when in search of\nthe invisible also.\"\n\nThe winter passed rapidly away, for it was passed by Philip in quiet\nand happiness; the spring came on, the vessel was to be fitted out,\nand Philip and Amine repaired to Amsterdam.\n\nThe _Utrecht_ was the name of the vessel to which he had been\nappointed, a ship of 400 tons, newly launched, and pierced for\ntwenty-four guns. Two more months passed away, during which Philip\nsuperintended the fitting and loading of the vessel, assisted by his\nfavourite Krantz, who served in her as first mate. Every convenience\nand comfort that Philip could think of was prepared for Amine; and\nin the month of May he started, with orders to stop at Gambroon and\nCeylon, run down the Straits of Sumatra, and from thence to force his\nway into the China seas, the Company having every reason to expect\nfrom the Portuguese the most determined opposition to the attempt. His\nship's company was numerous, and he had a small detachment of soldiers\non board to assist the supercargo, who carried out many thousand\ndollars to make purchases at ports in China, where their goods might\nnot be appreciated. Every care had been taken in the equipment of the\nvessel, which was perhaps the finest, the best manned, and freighted\nwith the most valuable cargo, which had been sent out by the India\nCompany.\n\nThe _Utrecht_ sailed with a flowing sheet, and was soon clear of the\nEnglish Channel; the voyage promised to be auspicious, favouring gales\nbore them without accident to within a few hundred miles of the Cape\nof Good Hope, when, for the first time, they were becalmed. Amine was\ndelighted: in the evenings she would pace the deck with Philip; then\nall was silent, except the splash of the wave as it washed against\nthe side of the vessel--all was in repose and beauty, as the bright\nsouthern constellations sparkled over their heads.\n\n\"Whose destinies can be in these stars, which appear not to those who\ninhabit the northern regions?\" said Amine, as she cast her eyes above,\nand watched them in their brightness; \"and what does that falling\nmeteor portend? what causes its rapid descent from heaven?\"\n\n\"Do you, then, put faith in stars, Amine?\"\n\n\"In Araby we do; and why not? They were not spread over the sky to\ngive light--for what then?\"\n\n\"To beautify the world. They have their uses, too.\"\n\n\"Then you agree with me--they have their uses, and the destinies of\nmen are there concealed. My mother was one of those who could read\nthem well. Alas! for me they are a sealed book.\"\n\n\"Is it not better so, Amine?\"\n\n\"Better!--say better to grovel on this earth with our selfish,\nhumbled race, wandering in mystery, and awe, and doubt, when we can\ncommunicate with the intelligences above! Does not the soul leap at\nher admission to confer with superior powers? Does not the proud heart\nbound at the feeling that its owner is one of those more gifted than\nthe usual race of mortals? Is it not a noble ambition?\"\n\n\"A dangerous one--most dangerous.\"\n\n\"And therefore most noble. They seem as if they would speak to me:\nlook at yon bright star--it beckons to me.\"\n\nFor some time Amine's eyes were raised aloft; she spoke not, and\nPhilip remained at her side. She walked to the gangway of the vessel,\nand looked down upon the placid wave, pierced by the moonbeams far\nbelow the surface.\n\n\"And does your imagination, Amine, conjure up a race of beings gifted\nto live beneath that deep blue wave, who sport amid the coral rocks,\nand braid their hair with pearls?\" said Philip, smiling.\n\n\"I know not, but it appears to me that it would be sweet to live\nthere. You may call to mind your dream, Philip; I was then, according\nto your description, one of those same beings.\"\n\n\"You were,\" replied Philip, thoughtfully.\n\n\"And yet I feel as if water would reject me, even if the vessel were\nto sink. In what manner this mortal frame of mine may be resolved\ninto its elements, I know not; but this I do feel, that it never will\nbecome the sport of, or be tossed by, the mocking waves. But come in,\nPhilip, dearest; it is late, and the decks are wet with dew.\"\n\nWhen the day dawned, the look-out man at the mast-head reported that\nhe perceived something floating on the still surface of the water, on\nthe beam of the vessel. Krantz went up with his glass to examine, and\nmade it out to be a small boat, probably cut adrift from some vessel.\nAs there was no appearance of wind, Philip permitted a boat to be sent\nto examine it, and after a long pull, the seamen returned on board,\ntowing the small boat astern.\n\n\"There is a body of a man in it, sir,\" said the second mate to Krantz,\nas he gained the gangway; \"but whether he is quite dead, or not, I\ncannot tell.\"\n\nKrantz reported this to Philip, who was, at that time, sitting at\nbreakfast with Amine in the cabin, and then proceeded to the gangway,\nto where the body of the man had been already handed up by the seamen.\nThe surgeon, who had been summoned, declared that life was not yet\nextinct, and was ordering him to be taken below for recovery, when, to\ntheir astonishment, the man turned as he lay, sat up, and ultimately\nrose upon his feet and staggered to a gun, when, after a time, he\nappeared to be fully recovered. In reply to questions put to him, he\nsaid that he was in a vessel which had been upset in a squall, that he\nhad time to cut away the small boat astern, and that all the rest of\nthe crew had perished. He had hardly made this answer, when Philip\nwith Amine came out of the cabin, and walked up to where the seamen\nwere crowded round the man; the seamen retreated so as to make an\nopening, when Philip and Amine, to their astonishment and horror,\nrecognised their old acquaintance, the one-eyed pilot Schriften.\n\n\"He! he! Captain Vanderdecken, I believe--glad to see you in command,\nand you too, fair lady.\"\n\nPhilip turned away with a chill at his heart; Amine's eye flashed as\nshe surveyed the wasted form of the wretched creature. After a few\nseconds, she turned round and followed Philip into the cabin, where\nshe found him with his face buried in his hands.\n\n\"Courage, Philip, courage!\" said Amine; \"it was indeed a heavy shock,\nand I fear me forbodes evil--but what then; it is our destiny.\"\n\n\"It is--it ought perhaps to be mine,\" replied Philip, raising his\nhead; \"but you, Amine, why should you be a partner--\"\n\n\"I am your partner, Philip, in life and in death. I would not die\nfirst, Philip, because it would grieve you; but your death will be the\nsignal for mine, and I will join you quickly.\"\n\n\"Surely, Amine, you would not hasten your own?\"\n\n\"Yes! and require but one moment for this little steel to do its\nduty.\"\n\n\"Nay! Amine, that is not lawful--our religion forbids it.\"\n\n\"It may do so, but I cannot tell why. I came into this world without\nmy own consent--surely I may leave it without asking the leave of\npriests! But let that pass for the present: what will you do with that\nSchriften?\"\n\n\"Put him on shore at the Cape; I cannot bear the odious wretch's\npresence. Did you not feel the chill, as before, when you approached\nhim?\"\n\n\"I did--I knew that he was there before I saw him; but still, I know\nnot why, I feel as if I would not send him away.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I believe it is because I am inclined to brave destiny, not to quail\nat it. The wretch can do no harm.\"\n\n\"Yes, he can--much: he can render the ship's company mutinous and\ndisaffected;--besides, he attempted to deprive me of my relic.\"\n\n\"I almost wish he had done so; then must you have discontinued this\nwild search.\"\n\n\"Nay, Amine, say not so; it is my duty, and I have taken my solemn\noath--\"\n\n\"But this Schriften--you cannot well put him ashore at the Cape; being\na Company's officer, you might send him home if you found a ship there\nhomeward-bound; still, were I you, I would let destiny work. He is\nwoven in with ours, that is certain. Courage, Philip, and let him\nremain.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are right, Amine; I may retard, but cannot escape,\nwhatever may be my intended fate.\"\n\n\"Let him remain, then, and let him do his worst. Treat him with\nkindness--who knows what we may gain from him?\"\n\n\"True, true, Amine; he has been my enemy without cause. Who can\ntell?--perhaps he may become my friend.\"\n\n\"And if not, you will have done your duty. Send for him now.\"\n\n\"No, not now--to-morrow; in the meantime, I will order him every\ncomfort.\"\n\n\"We are talking as if he were one of us, which I feel that he is not,\"\nreplied Amine; \"but still, mundane or not, we cannot but offer mundane\nkindness, and what this world, or rather what this ship affords. I\nlong now to talk with him, to see if I can produce any effect upon his\nice-like frame. Shall I make love to the ghoul?\" and Amine burst into\na bitter laugh.\n\nHere the conversation dropped, but its substance was not disregarded.\nThe next morning, the surgeon having reported that Schriften was\napparently quite recovered, he was summoned into the cabin. His frame\nwas wasted away to a skeleton, but his motions and his language were\nas sharp and petulant as ever.\n\n\"I have sent for you, Schriften, to know if there is anything that I\ncan do to make you more comfortable. Is there anything that you want?\"\n\n\"Want?\" replied Schriften, eyeing first Philip and then Amine.--\"He!\nhe! I think I want filling out a little.\"\n\n\"That you will, I trust, in good time; my steward has my orders to\ntake care of you.\"\n\n\"Poor man,\" said Amine, with a look of pity, \"how much he must have\nsuffered! Is not this the man who brought you the letter from the\nCompany, Philip?\"\n\n\"He! he! yes! Not very welcome, was it, lady?\"\n\n\"No, my good fellow, it's never a welcome message to a wife, that\nsends her husband away from her. But that was not your fault.\"\n\n\"If a husband will go to sea and leave a handsome wife, when he has,\nas they say, plenty of money to live upon on shore, he! he!\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, you may well say that,\" replied Amine.\n\n\"Better give it up. All folly, all madness--eh, captain?\"\n\n\"I must finish this voyage, at all events,\" replied Philip to Amine,\n\"whatever I may do afterwards. I have suffered much, and so have you,\nSchriften. You have been twice wrecked; now tell me what do you wish\nto do? Go home in the first ship, or go ashore at the Cape--or--\"\n\n\"Or do anything, so I get out of this ship--he! he!\"\n\n\"Not so. If you prefer sailing with me, as I know you are a good\nseaman, you shall have your rating and pay of pilot--that is, if you\nchoose to follow my fortunes.\"\n\n\"Follow?--Must follow. Yes! I'll sail with you, Mynheer Vanderdecken,\nI wish to be always near you--he! he!\"\n\n\"Be it so, then: as soon as you are strong again, you will go to your\nduty; till then, I will see that you want for nothing.\"\n\n\"Nor I, my good fellow. Come to me if you do, and I will be your\nhelp,\" said Amine. \"You have suffered much, but we will do what we can\nto make you forget it.\"\n\n\"Very good! very kind!\" replied Schriften, surveying the lovely face\nand figure of Amine. After a time, shrugging up his shoulders, he\nadded--\"A pity! Yes it is!--Must be, though.\"\n\n\"Farewell,\" continued Amine, holding out her hand to Schriften.\n\nThe man took it, and a cold shudder went to her heart; but she,\nexpecting such a result, would not appear to feel it. Schriften held\nher hand for a second or two in his own, looking at it earnestly, and\nthen at Amine's face.--\"So fair, so good! Mynheer Vanderdecken, I\nthank you. Lady, may Heaven preserve you!\"--Then, squeezing the hand\nof Amine which he had not released, Schriften hastened out of the\ncabin.\n\nSo great was the sudden icy shock which passed through Amine's frame\nwhen Schriften pressed her hand, that when with difficulty she gained\nthe sofa she fell upon it. After remaining with her hand pressed\nagainst her heart for some time, during which Philip bent over her,\nshe said in a breathless voice, \"That creature must be supernatural,\nI am sure of it, I am now convinced.--Well,\" continued she, after a\npause of some little while, \"all the better, if we can make him a\nfriend; and if I can I will.\"\n\n\"But think you, Amine, that those who are not of this world have\nfeelings of kindness, gratitude, and ill-will, as we have? Can they be\nmade subservient?\"\n\n\"Most surely so. If they have ill-will, as we know they have, they\nmust also be endowed with the better feelings. Why are there good and\nevil intelligences? They may have disencumbered themselves of their\nmortal clay, but the soul must be the same. A soul without feeling\nwere no soul at all. The soul is active in this world and must be so\nin the next. If angels can pity, they must feel like us. If demons can\nvex, they must feel like us. Our feelings change, then why not theirs?\nWithout feelings, there were no heaven, no hell. Here our souls are\nconfined, cribbed, and overladen, borne down by the heavy flesh by\nwhich they are, for the time, polluted; but the soul that has winged\nits flight from clay is, I think, not one jot more pure, more bright,\nor more perfect than those within ourselves. Can they be made\nsubservient, say you! Yes! they can; they can be forced, when mortals\npossess the means and power. The evil-inclined may be forced to good,\nas well as to evil. It is not the good and perfect spirits that we\nsubject by art, but those that are inclined to wrong. It is over them\nthat mortals have the power. Our arts have no power over the perfect\nspirits, but over those which are ever working evil, and which are\nbound to obey and do good, if those who master them require it.\"\n\n\"You still resort to forbidden arts, Amine. Is that right?\"\n\n\"Right! If we have power given to us, it is right to use it.\"\n\n\"Yes, most certainly, for good--but not for evil.\"\n\n\"Mortals in power, possessing nothing but what is mundane, are\nanswerable for the use of that power; so those gifted by superior\nmeans, are answerable as they employ those means. Does the God above\nmake a flower to grow, intending that it should not be gathered? No!\nneither does He allow supernatural aid to be given, if He did not\nintend that mortals should avail themselves of it.\"\n\nAs Amine's eyes beamed upon Philip's, he could not for the moment\nsubdue the idea rising in his mind, that she was not like other\nmortals, and he calmly observed, \"Am I sure, Amine, that I am wedded\nto one mortal as myself?\"\n\n\"Yes! yes! Philip, compose yourself, I am but mortal; would to Heaven\nI were not. Would to Heaven I were one of those who could hover over\nyou, watch you in all your perils, save and protect you in this your\nmad career; but I am but a poor weak woman, whose heart beats fondly,\ndevotedly for you--who, for you, would dare all and everything--who,\nchanged in her nature, has become courageous and daring from her love;\nand who rejects all creeds which would prevent her from calling upon\nheaven, or earth, or hell, to assist her in retaining with her her\nsoul's existence?\"\n\n\"Nay! nay! Amine, say not you reject the creed. Does not this,\"--and\nPhilip pulled from his bosom the holy relic, \"does not this, and the\nmessage sent by it, prove our creed is true?\"\n\n\"I have thought much of it, Philip. At first it startled me almost\ninto a belief, but even your own priests helped to undeceive me. They\nwould not answer you; they would have left you to guide yourself; the\nmessage and the holy word, and the wonderful signs given were not in\nunison with their creed, and they halted. May I not halt, if they\ndid? The relic may be as mystic, as powerful as you describe; but\nthe agencies may be false and wicked, the power given to it may have\nfallen into wrong hands--the power remains the same, but it is applied\nto uses not intended.\"\n\n\"The power, Amine, can only be exercised by those who are friends to\nHim who died upon it.\"\n\n\"Then is it no power at all; or if a power, not half so great as that\nof the arch-fiend; for his can work for good and evil both. But on\nthis point, dear Philip, we do not well agree, nor can we convince\neach other. You have been taught in one way, I another. That which\nour childhood has imbibed, which has grown up with our growth, and\nstrengthened with our years, is not to be eradicated. I have seen my\nmother work great charms, and succeed. You have knelt to priests: I\nblame not you!--blame not then your Amine. We both mean well--I trust,\ndo well.\"\n\n\"If a life of innocence and purity were all that were required, my\nAmine would be sure of future bliss.\"\n\n\"I think it is; and thinking so, it is my creed. There are many\ncreeds: who shall say which is the true one? And what matters it? they\nall have the same end in view--a future Heaven.\"\n\n\"True, Amine, true,\" replied Philip, pacing the cabin thoughtfully;\n\"and yet our priests say otherwise.\"\n\n\"What is the basis of their creed, Philip?\"\n\n\"Charity, and good-will.\"\n\n\"Does charity condemn to eternal misery those who have never heard\nthis creed, who have lived and died worshipping the Great Being after\ntheir best endeavours, and little knowledge?\"\n\n\"No, surely.\"\n\nAmine made no further observations; and Philip, after pacing for a few\nminutes in deep thought, walked out of the cabin.\n\nThe _Utrecht_ arrived at the Cape, watered, and proceeded on her\nvoyage and, after two months of difficult navigation, cast anchor off\nGambroon. During this time, Amine had been unceasing in her attempts\nto gain the good-will of Schriften. She had often conversed with him\non deck, and had done him every kindness, and had overcome that fear\nwhich his near approach had generally occasioned. Schriften gradually\nappeared mindful of this kindness, and at last to be pleased with\nAmine's company. To Philip he was at times civil and courteous, but\nnot always; but to Amine he was always deferent. His language was\nmystical, she could not prevent his chuckling laugh, his occasional\n\"He! he!\" from breaking forth. But when they anchored at Gambroon, he\nwas on such terms with her, that he would occasionally come into the\ncabin; and, although he would not sit down, would talk to Amine for\na few minutes, and then depart. While the vessel lay at anchor at\nGambroon, Schriften one evening walked up to Amine, who was sitting on\nthe poop. \"Lady,\" said he, after a pause, \"yon ship sails for your own\ncountry in a few days.\"\n\n\"So I am told,\" replied Amine.\n\n\"Will you take the advice of one who wishes you well? Return in that\nvessel, go back to your own cottage, and stay there till your husband\ncomes to you once more.\"\n\n\"Why is this advice given?\"\n\n\"Because I forbode danger, nay, perhaps death, a cruel death, to one I\nwould not harm.\"\n\n\"To me!\" replied Amine, fixing her eyes upon Schriften, and meeting\nhis piercing gaze.\n\n\"Yes, to you. Some people can see into futurity farther than others.\"\n\n\"Not if they are mortal,\" replied Amine.\n\n\"Yes, if they are mortal. But mortal or not, I do see that which I\nwould avert. Tempt not destiny farther.\"\n\n\"Who can avert it? If I take your counsel, still was it my destiny to\ntake your counsel. If I take it not, still it was my destiny.\"\n\n\"Well, then, avoid what threatens you.\"\n\n\"I fear not, yet do I thank you. Tell me, Schriften, hast thou not\nthy fate someway interwoven with that of my husband? I feel that thou\nhast.\"\n\n\"Why think you so, lady?\"\n\n\"For many reasons: twice you have summoned him, twice have you been\nwrecked, and miraculously reappeared and recovered. You know, too, of\nhis mission, that is evident.\"\n\n\"But proves nothing.\"\n\n\"Yes! it proves much; for it proves that you knew what was supposed to\nbe known but to him alone.\"\n\n\"It was known to you, and holy men debated on it,\" replied Schriften\nwith a sneer.\n\n\"How knew you that, again?\"\n\n\"He! he!\" replied Schriften; \"forgive me, lady, I meant not to affront\nyou.\"\n\n\"You cannot deny that you are connected mysteriously and\nincomprehensibly with this mission of my husband's. Tell me, is it as\nhe believes, true and holy?\"\n\n\"If he thinks that it is true and holy, it becomes so.\"\n\n\"Why then do you appear his enemy?\"\n\n\"I am not _his_ enemy, fair lady.\"\n\n\"You are not his enemy--why then did you once attempt to deprive him\nof the mystic relic by which the mission is to be accomplished?\"\n\n\"I would prevent his further search, for reasons which must not be\ntold. Does that prove that I am his enemy? Would it not be better that\nhe should remain on shore with competence and you, than be crossing\nthe wild seas on this mad search? Without the relic it is not to be\naccomplished. It were a kindness, then, to take it from him.\"\n\nAmine answered not, for she was lost in thought.\n\n\"Lady,\" continued Schriften, after a time; \"I wish you well. For your\nhusband I care not, yet do I wish him no harm. Now hear me; if you\nwish for your future life to be one of ease and peace--if you wish to\nremain long in this world with the husband of your choice--of your\nfirst and warmest love--if you wish that he should die in his bed at a\ngood old age, and that you should close his eyes with children's tears\nlamenting, and their smiles reserved to cheer their mother--all this I\nsee and can promise is in futurity, if you will take that relic from\nhis bosom and give it up to me. But if you would that he should\nsuffer more than man has ever suffered, pass his whole life in doubt,\nanxiety, and pain, until the deep wave receive his corpse, then let\nhim keep it--If you would that your own days be shortened, and yet\nthose remaining be long in human sufferings, if you would be separated\nfrom him and die a cruel death, then let him keep it. I can read\nfuturity, and such must be the destiny of both. Lady, consider well, I\nmust leave you now. To-morrow I will have your answer.\"\n\nSchriften walked away and left Amine to her own reflections. For a\nlong while she repeated to herself the conversation and denunciations\nof the man, whom she was now convinced was not of this world, and was\nin some way or another deeply connected with her husband's fate.\n\"To me he wishes well, no harm to my husband, and would prevent his\nsearch. Why would he?--that he will not tell. He has tempted me,\ntempted me most strangely. How easy 'twere to take the relic whilst\nPhilip sleeps upon my bosom--but how treacherous! And yet a life of\ncompetence and ease, a smiling family, a good old age; what offers to\na fond and doting wife! And if not, toil, anxiety, and a watery grave;\nand for me! Pshaw! that's nothing. And yet to die separated from\nPhilip, is that nothing? Oh, no, the thought is dreadful.--I do\nbelieve him. Yes, he has foretold the future, and told it truly. Could\nI persuade Philip? No! I know him well; he has vowed, and is not to be\nchanged. And yet, if the relic were taken without his knowledge, he\nwould not have to blame himself. Who then would he blame? Could I\ndeceive him? I, the wife of his bosom tell a lie. No! no! it must not\nbe. Come what will, it is our destiny, and I am resigned. I would that\nSchriften had not spoken. Alas! we search into futurity, and then\nwould fain retrace our steps, and wish we had remained in ignorance.\"\n\n\"What makes you so pensive, Amine?\" said Philip, who some time\nafterwards walked up to where she was seated.\n\nAmine replied not at first. \"Shall I tell him all?\" thought she. \"It\nis my only chance--I will.\" Amine repeated the conversation between\nher and Schriften. Philip made no reply; he sat down by Amine and took\nher hand. Amine dropped her head upon her husband's shoulder. \"What\nthink you, Amine?\" said Philip, after a time.\n\n\"I could not steal your relic, Philip; perhaps you'll give it to me.\"\n\n\"And my father, Amine, my poor father--his dreadful doom to be\neternal! He who appealed, was permitted to appeal to his son, that\nthat dreadful doom might be averted. Does not the conversation of this\nman prove to you that my mission is not false? Does not his knowledge\nof it strengthen all? Yet, why would he prevent it?\" continued Philip,\nmusing.\n\n\"Why, I cannot tell, Philip, but I would fain prevent it. I feel that\nhe has power to read the future, and has read aright.\"\n\n\"Be it so; he has spoken, but not plainly. He has promised me what I\nhave long been prepared for--what I vowed to Heaven to suffer. Already\nhave I suffered much, and am prepared to suffer more. I have long\nlooked upon this world as a pilgrimage, and (selected as I have been)\ntrust that my reward will be in the other. But, Amine, you are not\nbound by oath to Heaven, you have made no compact. He advised you to\ngo home. He talked of a cruel death. Follow his advice and avoid it.\"\n\n\"I am not bound by oath, Philip; but hear me; as I hope for future\nbliss, I now bind myself--\"\n\n\"Hold, Amine!\"\n\n\"Nay, Philip, you cannot prevent me; for if you do now, I will repeat\nit when you are absent. A cruel death were a charity to me, for I\nshall not see you suffer. Then may I never expect future bliss, may\neternal misery be my portion, if I leave you as long as fate permits\nus to be together. I am yours--your wife; my fortunes, my present, my\nfuture, my all are embarked with you, and destiny may do its worst,\nfor Amine will not quail. I have no recreant heart to turn aside from\ndanger or from suffering. In that one point, Philip, at least, you\nchose, you wedded well.\"\n\nPhilip raised her hand to his lips in silence, and the conversation\nwas not resumed. The next evening, Schriften came up again to Amine.\n\"Well, lady?\" said he.\n\n\"Schriften, it cannot be,\" replied Amine; \"yet do I thank you much.\"\n\n\"Lady, if he must follow up his mission, why should you?\"\n\n\"Schriften, I am his wife--his for ever, in this world, and the next.\nYou cannot blame me.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Schriften, \"I do not blame, I admire you. I feel sorry.\nBut, after all, what is death? Nothing. He! he!\" and Schriften\nhastened away, and left Amine to herself.\n\n\n\nChapter XXII\n\n\nThe _Utrecht_ sailed from Gambroon, touched at Ceylon, and proceeded\non her voyage in the Eastern Seas. Schriften still remained on board,\nbut since his last conversation with Amine he had kept aloof, and\nappeared to avoid both her and Philip; still there was not, as before,\nany attempt to make the ship's company disaffected, nor did he indulge\nin his usual taunts and sneers. The communication he had made to Amine\nhad also its effect upon her and Philip; they were more pensive and\nthoughtful; each attempted to conceal their gloom from the other; and\nwhen they embraced, it was with the mournful feeling that perhaps it\nwas an indulgence they would soon be deprived of: at the same time,\nthey steeled their hearts to endurance and prepared to meet the worst.\nKrantz wondered at the change, but of course could not account for it.\nThe _Utrecht_ was not far from the Andaman Isles, when Krantz, who had\nwatched the barometer, came in early one morning and called Philip.\n\n\"We have every prospect of a typhoon, sir,\" said Krantz; \"the glass\nand the weather are both threatening.\"\n\n\"Then we must make all snug. Send down top-gallant yards and small\nsails directly. We will strike top-gallant masts. I will be out in a\nminute.\"\n\nPhilip hastened on deck. The sea was smooth, but already the moaning\nof the wind gave notice of the approaching storm. The vacuum in the\nair was about to be filled up, and the convulsion would be terrible; a\nwhite haze gathered fast, thicker and thicker; the men were turned up,\neverything of weight was sent below, and the guns were secured. Now\ncame a blast of wind which careened the ship, passed over, and in a\nminute she righted as before; then another and another, fiercer and\nfiercer still. The sea, although smooth, at last appeared white as a\nsheet with foam, as the typhoon swept along in its impetuous career;\nit burst upon the vessel, which bowed down to her gunwale and there\nremained; in a quarter of an hour the hurricane had passed over, and\nthe vessel was relieved; but the sea had risen, and the wind was\nstrong. In another hour the blast again came, more wild, more furious\nthan the first, the waves were dashed into their faces, torrents\nof rain descended, the ship was thrown on her beam ends, and thus\nremained till the wild blast had passed away, to sweep destruction far\nbeyond them, leaving behind it a tumultuous angry sea.\n\n\"It is nearly over I believe, sir,\" said Krantz. \"It is clearing up a\nlittle to windward.\"\n\n\"We have had the worst of it, I believe,\" said Philip.\n\n\"No! there is worse to come,\" said a low voice near to Philip. It was\nSchriften who spoke.\n\n\"A vessel to windward scudding before the gale,\" cried Krantz.\n\nPhilip looked to windward, and in the spot where the horizon was\nclearest, he saw a vessel under topsails and foresail, standing right\ndown. \"She is a large vessel; bring me my glass.\" The telescope was\nbrought from the cabin, but before Philip could use it, a haze had\nagain gathered up to windward, and the vessel was not to be seen.\n\n\"Thick again,\" observed Philip, as he shut in his telescope; \"we must\nlook out for that vessel, that she does not run too close to us.\"\n\n\"She has seen us, no doubt, sir,\" said Krantz.\n\nAfter a few minutes the typhoon again raged, and the atmosphere was of\na murky gloom. It seemed as if some heavy fog had been hurled along\nby the furious wind; nothing was to be distinguished except the white\nfoam of the sea, and that not the distance of half a cable's length,\nwhere it was lost in one dark gray mist. The storm-staysail yielding\nto the force of the wind, was rent into strips, and flogged and\ncracked with a noise even louder than the gale. The furious blast\nagain blew over, and the mist cleared up a little.\n\n\"Ship on the weather beam close aboard of us,\" cried one of the men.\n\nKrantz and Philip sprung upon the gunwale, and beheld the large ship\nbearing right down upon them, not three cables' length distant.\n\n\"Helm up! she does not see us, and she will be aboard of us!\" cried\nPhilip. \"Helm up, I say, hard up, quick!\"\n\nThe helm was put up, as the men, perceiving their imminent danger,\nclimbed upon the guns to look if the vessel altered her course; but\nno--down she came, and the head-sails of the _Utrecht_ having been\ncarried away, to their horror they perceived that she would not answer\nher helm and pay off as they required.\n\n\"Ship, ahoy!\" roared Philip through his trumpet--but the gale drove\nthe sound back.\n\n\"Ship, ahoy!\" cried Krantz on the gunwale, waving his hat. It was\nuseless--down she came, with the waters foaming under her bows, and\nwas now within pistol-shot of the _Utrecht_.\n\n\"Ship, ahoy!\" roared all the sailors, with a shout that must have been\nheard: it was not attended to; down came the vessel upon them, and now\nher cutwater was within ten yards of the _Utrecht_. The men of the\n_Utrecht_, who expected that their vessel would be severed in half by\nthe concussion, climbed upon the weather gunwale, all ready to catch\nat the ropes of the other vessel and climb on board of her. Amine who\nhad been surprised at the noise on deck, had come out and had taken\nPhilip by the arm.\n\n\"Trust to me--the shock\"--said Philip. He said no more; the cutwater\nof the stranger touched their sides; one general cry was raised by the\nsailors of the _Utrecht_, they sprang to catch at the rigging of\nthe other vessel's bowsprit which was now pointed between their\nmasts--they caught at nothing--nothing--there was no shock--no\nconcussion of the two vessels--the stranger appeared to cleave through\nthem--her hull passed along in silence--no cracking of timbers--no\nfalling of masts--the foreyard passed through their mainsail, yet\nthe canvas was unrent--the whole vessel appeared to cut through the\n_Utrecht_, yet left no trace of injury--not fast, but slowly, as if\nshe were really sawing through her by the heaving and tossing of the\nsea with her sharp prow. The stranger's forechains had passed their\ngunwale before Philip could recover himself. \"Amine,\" cried he, at\nlast, \"the Phantom Ship! my father!\"\n\nThe seamen of the _Utrecht_, more astounded by the marvellous result\nthan by their former danger, threw themselves down upon deck; some\nhastened below, some prayed, others were dumb with astonishment and\nfear. Amine appeared more calm than any, not excepting Philip; she\nsurveyed the vessel as it slowly forced its way through; she beheld\nthe seamen on board of her coolly leaning over her gunwale, as\nif deriding the destruction they had occasioned; she looked for\nVanderdecken himself, and on the poop of the vessel, with his trumpet\nunder his arm, she beheld the image of her Philip--the same hardy,\nstrong build--the same features--about the same age apparently--there\ncould be no doubt it was the _doomed_ Vanderdecken!\n\n\"See, Philip,\" said she, \"see!--your father!\"\n\n\"Even so--Merciful Heaven! It is--it is\"--and Philip, overpowered by\nhis feelings, sank upon deck.\n\nThe vessel had now passed over the _Utrecht_; the form of the elder\nVanderdecken was seen to walk aft and look over the taffrail; Amine\nperceived it to start and turn away suddenly--she looked down, and\nsaw Schriften shaking his fist in defiance at the supernatural being!\nAgain the Phantom Ship flew to leeward before the gale, and was soon\nlost in the mist; but before that, Amine had turned and perceived the\nsituation of Philip. No one but herself and Schriften appeared able to\nact or move. She caught the pilot's eye, beckoned to him, and with his\nassistance Philip was led into the cabin.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXIII\n\n\n\"I have then seen him,\" said Philip, after he had lain down on the\nsofa in the cabin for some minutes to recover himself, while Amine\nbent over him. \"I have at last seen him, Amine! Can you doubt now?\"\n\n\"No, Philip, I have now no doubt,\" replied Amine, mournfully; \"but\ntake courage, Philip.\"\n\n\"For myself, I want not courage--but for you, Amine--you know that his\nappearance portends a mischief that will surely come.\"\n\n\"Let it come,\" replied Amine, calmly; \"I have long been prepared for\nit, and so have you.\"\n\n\"Yes, for myself; but not for you.\"\n\n\"You have been wrecked often, and have been saved--then why should not\nI?\"\n\n\"But the sufferings!\"\n\n\"Those suffer least, who have most courage to bear up against them. I\nam but a woman, weak and frail in body, but I trust I have that within\nme which will not make you feel ashamed of Amine. No, Philip, you will\nhave no wailing, no expression of despair from Amine's lips; if she\ncan console you, she will; if she can assist you, she will; but, come\nwhat may, if she cannot serve you, at least, she will prove no burden\nto you.\"\n\n\"Your presence in misfortune would un-nerve me, Amine.\"\n\n\"It shall not; it shall add to your resolution. Let fate do its\nworst.\"\n\n\"Depend upon it, Amine, that will be ere long.\"\n\n\"Be it so,\" replied Amine; \"but, Philip, it were as well you showed\nyourself on deck--the men are frightened, and your absence will be\nobserved.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said Philip; and rising and embracing her, he left\nthe cabin.\n\n\"It is but too true, then,\" thought Amine. \"Now to prepare for\ndisaster and death--the warning has come. I would I could know more.\nOh! mother, mother, look down upon thy child, and in a dream reveal\nthe mystic arts which I have forgotten, then should I know more; but I\nhave promised Philip, that unless separated--yes, that idea is worse\nthan death, and I have a sad foreboding; my courage fails me only when\nI think of that!\"\n\nPhilip, on his return to the deck, found the crew of the vessel in\ngreat consternation. Krantz himself appeared bewildered--he had not\nforgotten the appearance of the Phantom Ship off Desolation Harbour,\nand the vessels following her to their destruction. This second\nappearance, more awful than the former, quite unmanned him; and when\nPhilip came out of the cabin, he was leaning in gloomy silence against\nthe weather bulkhead.\n\n\"We shall never reach port again, sir,\" said he to Philip, as he came\nup to him.\n\n\"Silence, silence; the men may hear you.\"\n\n\"It matters not--they think the same,\" replied Krantz.\n\n\"But they are wrong,\" replied Philip, turning to the seamen. \"My lads!\nthat some disaster may happen to us, after the appearance of this\nvessel, is most probable; I have seen her before more than once, and\ndisasters did then happen; but here I am alive and well, therefore it\ndoes not prove that we cannot escape as I have before done. We must do\nour best, and trust in Heaven. The gale is breaking fast, and in a few\nhours we shall have fine weather. I have met this Phantom Ship\nbefore, and care not how often I meet it again. Mr Krantz, get up the\nspirits--the men have had hard work, and must be fatigued.\"\n\nThe very prospect of obtaining liquor, appeared to give courage to the\nmen; they hastened to obey the order, and the quantity served out was\nsufficient to give courage to the most fearful, and induce others to\ndefy old Vanderdecken and his whole crew of imps. The next morning the\nweather was fine, the sea smooth, and the _Utrecht_ went gaily on her\nvoyage.\n\nMany days of gentle breezes and favouring winds gradually wore off the\npanic occasioned by the supernatural appearance, and if not forgotten,\nit was referred to either in jest or with indifference. They now\nhad run through the Straits of Malacca, and entered the Polynesian\nArchipelago. Philip's orders were to refresh and call for instructions\nat the small island of Boton, then in possession of the Dutch. They\narrived there in safety, and after remaining two days, again sailed on\ntheir voyage, intending to make their passage between the Celebes and\nthe island of Galago. The weather was still clear and the wind light:\nthey proceeded cautiously, on account of the reefs and currents,\nand with a careful watch for the piratical vessels, which have for\ncenturies infested those seas; but they were not molested, and had\ngained well up among the islands to the north of Galago, when it fell\ncalm, and the vessel was borne to the eastward of it by the current.\nThe calm lasted several days, and they could procure no anchorage; at\nlast they found themselves among the cluster of islands near to the\nnorthern coast of New Guinea.\n\nThe anchor was dropped, and the sails furled for the night; a\ndrizzling small rain came on, the weather was thick, and watches were\nstationed in every part of the ship, that they might not be surprised\nby the pirate proas, for the current ran past the ship, at the rate\nof eight or nine miles per hour, and these vessels, if hid among the\nislands, might sweep down upon them unperceived.\n\nIt was twelve o'clock at night when Philip, who was in bed, was\nawakened by a shock; he thought it might be a proa running alongside,\nand he started from his bed and ran out. He found Krantz, who had\nbeen awakened by the same cause, running up undressed--another shock\nsucceeded, and the ship careened to port. Philip then knew that the\nship was on shore.\n\nThe thickness of the night prevented them from ascertaining where they\nwere, but the lead was thrown over the side, and they found that they\nwere lying on shore on a sand bank, with not more than fourteen feet\nwater on the deepest side, and that they were broadside on, with\na strong current pressing them further up on the bank; indeed the\ncurrent ran like a mill-race, and each minute they were swept into\nshallower water.\n\nOn examination they found that the ship had dragged her anchor, which,\nwith the cable, was still taut from the starboard bow, but this did\nnot appear to prevent the vessel from being swept further up on the\nbank. It was supposed that the anchor had parted at the shank, and\nanother anchor was let go.\n\nNothing more could be done till daybreak, and impatiently did they\nwait till the next morning. As the sun rose, the mist cleared away,\nand they discovered that they were on shore on a sand bank, a small\nportion of which was above water, and round which the current ran with\ngreat impetuosity. About three miles from them was a cluster of small\nislands with cocoa-trees growing on them, but with no appearance of\ninhabitants.\n\n\"I fear we have little chance,\" observed Krantz to Philip. \"If we\nlighten the vessel the anchor may not hold, and we shall be swept\nfurther on, and it is impossible to lay out an anchor against the\nforce of this current.\"\n\n\"At all events we must try; but I grant that our situation is anything\nbut satisfactory. Send all the hands aft.\"\n\nThe men came aft, gloomy and dispirited.\n\n\"My lads!\" said Philip, \"why are you disheartened?\"\n\n\"We are doomed, sir; we knew it would be so.\"\n\n\"I thought it probable that the ship would be lost--I told you so; but\nthe loss of the ship does not involve that of the ship's company--nay,\nit does not follow that the ship is to be lost, although she may be in\ngreat difficulty, as she is at present. What fear is there for us, my\nmen?--the water is smooth--we have plenty of time before us--we can\nmake a raft and take to our boats--it never blows among these islands,\nand we have land close under our lee. Let us first try what we can do\nwith the ship; if we fail, we must then take care of ourselves.\"\n\nThe men caught at the idea and went to work willingly; the water casks\nwere started, the pumps set going, and everything that could be spared\nwas thrown over to lighten the ship; but the anchor still dragged from\nthe strength of the current and bad holding-ground; and Philip and\nKrantz perceived that they were swept further on the bank.\n\nNight came on before they quitted their toil, and then a fresh breeze\nsprung up and created a swell, which occasioned the vessel to beat\non the hard sand; thus did they continue until the next morning. At\ndaylight the men resumed their labours, and the pumps were again\nmanned to clear the vessel of the water which had been started, but\nafter a time they pumped up sand. This told them that a plank had\nstarted, and that their labours were useless; the men left their work,\nbut Philip again encouraged them, and pointed out that they could\neasily save themselves, and all that they had to do was to construct a\nraft, which would hold provisions for them, and receive that portion\nof the crew who could not be taken into the boats.\n\nAfter some repose the men again set to work; the topsails were struck,\nthe yards lowered down, and the raft was commenced under the lee of\nthe vessel, where the strong current was checked. Philip, recollecting\nhis former disaster, took great pains in the construction of this\nraft, and aware that as the water and provisions were expended there\nwould be no occasion to tow so heavy a mass, he constructed it in two\nparts, which might easily be severed, and thus the boats would have\nless to tow, as soon as circumstances would enable them to part with\none of them.\n\nNight again terminated their labours, and the men retired to rest, the\nweather continuing fine, with very little wind. By noon the next day\nthe raft was complete; water and provisions were safely stowed on\nboard; a secure and dry place was fitted up for Amine in the centre\nof one portion; spare ropes, sails, and everything which could prove\nuseful, in case of their being forced on shore, were put in. Muskets\nand ammunition were also provided, and everything was ready, when the\nmen came aft and pointed out to Philip that there was plenty of money\non board, which it was folly to leave, and that they wished to carry\nas much as they could away with them. As this intimation was given in\na way that made it evident they intended that it should be complied\nwith, Philip did not refuse; but resolved, in his own mind, that when\nthey arrived at a place where he could exercise his authority, the\nmoney should be reclaimed for the Company to whom it belonged. The men\nwent down below, and while Philip was making arrangements with Amine,\nhanded the casks of dollars out of the hold, broke them open and\nhelped themselves--quarrelling with each other for the first\npossession, as each cask was opened. At last every man had obtained as\nmuch as he could carry, and had placed his spoil on the raft with his\nbaggage, or in the boat to which he had been appointed. All was now\nready--Amine was lowered down, and took her station--the boats took in\ntow the raft, which was cast off from the vessel, and away they went\nwith the current, pulling with all their strength, to avoid being\nstranded upon that part of the sand bank which appeared above water.\nThis was the great danger which they had to encounter, and which they\nvery narrowly escaped.\n\nThey numbered eighty-six souls in all: in the boats there were\nthirty-two; the rest were on the raft, which being well-built and full\nof timber, floated high out of the water, now that the sea was so\nsmooth. It had been agreed upon by Philip and Krantz, that one of them\nshould remain on the raft and the other in one of the boats; but, at\nthe time the raft quitted the ship, they were both on the raft, as\nthey wished to consult, as soon as they discovered the direction of\nthe current, which would be the most advisable course for them to\npursue. It appeared that as soon as the current had passed the bank,\nit took a more southerly direction towards New Guinea. It was then\ndebated between them whether they should or should not land on that\nisland, the natives of which were known to be pusillanimous, yet\ntreacherous. A long debate ensued, which ended, however, in their\nresolving not to decide as yet, but wait and see what might occur. In\nthe meantime, the boats pulled to the westward, while the current set\nthem fast down in a southerly direction.\n\nNight came on, and the boats dropped the grapnels, with which they had\nbeen provided; and Philip was glad to find that the current was not\nnear so strong, and the grapnels held both boats and raft. Covering\nthemselves up with the spare sails with which they had provided\nthemselves, and setting a watch, the tired seamen were soon fast\nasleep.\n\n\"Had I not better remain in one of the boats?\" observed Krantz.\n\"Suppose, to save themselves, the boats were to leave the raft.\"\n\n\"I have thought of that,\" replied Philip, \"and have, therefore, not\nallowed any provisions or water in the boats; they will not leave us\nfor that reason.\"\n\n\"True, I had forgotten that.\"\n\nKrantz remained on watch, and Philip retired to the repose which he so\nmuch needed. Amine met him with open arms.\n\n\"I have no fear, Philip,\" said she, \"I rather like this wild\nadventurous change. We will go on shore and build our hut beneath\nthe cocoa-trees, and I shall repine when the day comes which brings\nsuccour, and releases us from our desert isle. What do I require but\nyou?\"\n\n\"We are in the hands of One above, dear, who will act with us as He\npleases. We have to be thankful that it is no worse,\" replied Philip.\n\"But now to rest, for I shall soon be obliged to watch.\"\n\nThe morning dawned, with a smooth sea and a bright blue sky; the raft\nhad been borne to leeward of the cluster of uninhabited islands of\nwhich we spoke, and was now without hopes of reaching them; but to the\nwestward were to be seen on the horizon the refracted heads and trunks\nof cocoa-nut trees, and in that direction it was resolved that they\nshould tow the raft. The breakfast had been served out, and the men\nhad taken to the oars, when they discovered a proa, full of men,\nsweeping after them from one of the islands to windward. That it was\na pirate vessel there could be no doubt; but Philip and Krantz\nconsidered that their force was more than sufficient to repel them,\nshould an attack be made. This was pointed out to the men; arms were\ndistributed to all in the boats, as well as to those on the raft; and\nthat the seamen might not be fatigued, they were ordered to lie on\ntheir oars, and await the coming up of the vessel.\n\nAs soon as the pirate was within range, having reconnoitred her\nantagonists, she ceased pulling and commenced firing from a small\npiece of cannon, which was mounted on her bows. The grape and\nlangridge which she poured upon them wounded several of the men,\nalthough Philip had ordered them to lie down flat on the raft and\nin the boats. The pirate advanced nearer, and her fire became\nmore destructive, without any opportunity of returning it by the\n_Utrecht's_ people. At last it was proposed, as the only chance of\nescape, that the boats should attack the pirate. This was agreed to by\nPhilip--more men were sent in the boats--Krantz took the command--the\nraft was cast off, and the boats pulled away. But scarcely had they\ncleared the raft, when, as by one sudden thought, they turned round\nand pulled away in the opposite direction. Krantz's voice was heard\nby Philip, and his sword was seen to flash through the air--a moment\nafterwards he plunged into the sea, and swam to the raft. It appeared\nthat the people in the boats, anxious to preserve the money which they\nhad possession of, had agreed among themselves to pull away and leave\nthe raft to its fate. The proposal for attacking the pirate had been\nsuggested with that view, and as soon as they were clear of the\nraft, they put their intentions into execution. In vain had Krantz\nexpostulated and threatened; they would have taken his life; and when\nhe found that his efforts were of no avail, he leaped from the boat.\n\"Then are we lost, I fear,\" said Philip. \"Our numbers are so reduced,\nthat we cannot hope to hold out long. What think you, Schriften?\"\nventured Philip, addressing the pilot who stood near to him.\n\n\"Lost--but not lost by the pirates--no harm there. He! he!\"\n\nThe remark of Schriften was correct. The pirates, imagining that in\ntaking to their boat, the people had carried with them everything that\nwas valuable, instead of firing at the raft, immediately gave chase to\nthe boats. The sweeps were now out, and the proa flew over the smooth\nwater like a sea-bird, passed the raft, and was at first evidently\ngaining on the boats; but their speed soon slackened, and as the day\npassed, the boats, and then the pirate vessel disappeared in the\nsouthward; the distance between them being apparently much the same as\nat the commencement of the chase.\n\nThe raft being now at the mercy of the winds and waves, Philip and\nKrantz collected the carpenter's tools which had been brought from\nthe ship, and selecting two spars from the raft, they made every\npreparation for stepping a mast and setting sail by the next morning.\n\nThe morning dawned, and the first objects that met their view, were\nthe boats pulling back towards the raft, followed closely by the\npirate. The men had pulled the whole night, and were worn out with\nfatigue. It was presumed that a consultation had been held, in which\nit was agreed that they should make a sweep, so as to return to the\nraft; as, if they gained it, they would be able to defend themselves,\nand moreover, obtain provisions and water, which they had not on board\nat the time of their desertion. But it was fated otherwise; gradually\nthe men dropped from their oars, exhausted, into the bottom of the\nboat, and the pirate vessel followed them with renewed ardour. The\nboats were captured one by one; the booty found was more than the\npirates anticipated, and it hardly need be said that not one man was\nspared. All this took place within three miles of the raft, and Philip\nanticipated that the next movement of the vessel would be towards\nthem, but he was mistaken. Satisfied with their booty, and imagining\nthat there could be no more on the raft, the pirate pulled away to the\neastward, towards the islands from amongst which she had first made\nher appearance. Thus were those who expected to escape and who had\ndeserted their companions, deservedly punished, whilst those who\nanticipated every disaster from this desertion, discovered that it was\nthe cause of their being saved.\n\nThe remaining people on board the raft amounted to about forty-five;\nPhilip, Krantz, Schriften, Amine, the two mates, sixteen seamen,\nand twenty-four soldiers, who had been embarked at Amsterdam. Of\nprovisions they had sufficient for three or four weeks, but of water\nthey were very short, already not having sufficient for more than\nthree days at the usual allowance. As soon as the mast had been\nstepped and rigged, and the sails set (although there was hardly a\nbreath of wind), Philip explained to the men the necessity of reducing\nthe quantity of water, and it was agreed that it should be served out\nso as to extend the supply to twelve days, the allowance being reduced\nto half a pint per day.\n\nThere was a debate at this time, as the raft was in two parts, whether\nit would not be better to cast off the smaller one and put all the\npeople on board the other; but this proposal was overruled, as in the\nfirst place, although the boats had deserted them, the number on the\nraft had not much diminished, and moreover, the raft would steer much\nbetter under sail, now that it had length, than it would do if they\nreduced its dimensions and altered its shape to a square mass of\nfloating wood.\n\nFor three days it was a calm, the sun poured down his hot beams upon\nthem, and the want of water was severely felt; those who continued to\ndrink spirits suffered the most.\n\nOn the fourth day the breeze sprung up favourably, and the sail was\nfilled; it was a relief to their burning brows and blistered backs;\nand as the raft sailed on at the rate of four miles an hour, the men\nwere gay and full of hope. The land below the cocoa-nut trees was now\ndistinguishable, and they anticipated that the next day they could\nland and procure the water, which they now so craved for. All night\nthey carried sail, but the next morning they discovered that the\ncurrent was strong against them, and that what they gained when the\nbreeze was fresh, they lost from the adverse current as soon as it\nwent down; the breeze was always fresh in the morning, but it fell\ncalm in the evening. Thus did they continue for four days more, every\nnoon being not ten miles from the land but the next morning swept away\nto a distance, and having their ground to retrace. Eight days had now\npassed, and the men, worn out with exposure to the burning sun, became\ndiscontented and mutinous. At one time they insisted that the raft\nshould be divided, that they might gain the land with the other half;\nat another, that the provisions which they could no longer eat should\nbe thrown overboard to lighten the raft. The difficulty under which\nthey lay, was the having no anchor or grapnel to the raft, the boats\nhaving carried away with them all that had been taken from the ship.\nPhilip then proposed to the men, that, as every one of them had such a\nquantity of dollars, the money should be sewed up in canvas bags, each\nman's property separate; and that with this weight to the ropes they\nwould probably be enabled to hold the raft against the current for one\nnight, when they would be able the next day to gain the shore; but\nthis was refused--they would not risk their money. No, no--fools!\nthey would sooner part with their lives by the most miserable of\nall deaths. Again and again was this proposed to them by Philip and\nKrantz, but without success.\n\nIn the meantime, Amine had kept up her courage and her spirits;\nproving to Philip a valuable adviser and a comforter in his\nmisfortunes. \"Cheer up, Philip,\" would she say; \"we shall yet build\nour cottage under the shade of those cocoa-nut trees, and pass a\nportion, if not the remainder of our lives in peace; for who indeed\nis there who would think to find us in these desolate and untrodden\nregions?\"\n\nSchriften was quiet and well-behaved; talked much with Amine, but with\nnobody else. Indeed he appeared to have a stronger feeling in favour\nof Amine than he had ever shown before. He watched over her and\nattended her; and Amine would often look up after being silent, and\nperceived Schriften's face wear an air of pity and melancholy, which\nshe had believed it impossible that he could have exhibited.\n\nAnother day passed; again they neared the land, and again did the\nbreeze die away, and they were swept back by the current. The men now\nrose, and in spite of the endeavours of Philip and Krantz, they rolled\ninto the sea all the provisions and stores, everything but one cask of\nspirits and the remaining stock of water; they then sat down at the\nupper end of the raft with gloomy, threatening looks, and in close\nconsultation.\n\nAnother night closed in: Philip was full of anxiety. Again he urged\nthem to anchor with their money, but in vain; they ordered him away,\nand he returned to the after part of the raft, upon which Amine's\nsecure retreat had been erected; he leant on it in deep thought and\nmelancholy, for he imagined that Amine was asleep.\n\n\"What disturbs you, Philip?\"\n\n\"What disturbs me? The avarice and folly of these men. They will die,\nrather than risk their hateful money. They have the means of saving\nthemselves and us, and they will not. There is weight enough in\nbullion on the fore part of the raft to hold a dozen floating masses\nsuch as this, yet they will not risk it. Cursed love of gold! it makes\nmen fools, madmen, villains. We have now but two days' water--doled\nout as it is drop by drop. Look at their emaciated, broken down,\nwasted forms, and yet see how they cling to money, which probably\nthey will never have occasion for, even if they gain the land. I am\ndistracted!\"\n\n\"You suffer, Philip, you suffer from privation; but I have been\ncareful, I thought that this would come; I have saved both water and\nbiscuit--I have here four bottles;--drink, Philip, and it will relieve\nyou.\"\n\nPhilip drank; it did relieve him, for the excitement of the day had\npressed heavily on him.\n\n\"Thanks, Amine--thanks, dearest! I feel better now.--Good Heaven! are\nthere such fools as to value the dross of metal above one drop of\nwater in a time of suffering and privation such as this?\"\n\nThe night closed in as before; the stars shone bright but there was no\nmoon, Philip had risen at midnight to relieve Krantz from the steerage\nof the raft. Usually the men had lain about in every part of the raft,\nbut this night the majority of them remained forward. Philip was\ncommuning with his own bitter thoughts, when he heard a scuffle\nforward, and the voice of Krantz crying out to him for help. He\nquitted the helm, and seizing his cutlass ran forward, where he found\nKrantz down, and the men securing him. He fought his way to him, but\nwas himself seized and disarmed. \"Cut away--cut away,\" was called out\nby those who held him; and, in a few seconds, Philip had the misery to\nbehold the after part of the raft, with Amine upon it, drifted apart\nfrom the one on which he stood. \"For mercy's sake! my wife--my\nAmine--for Heaven's sake save her!\" cried Philip, struggling in vain\nto disengage himself. Amine also, who had run to the side of the raft,\nheld out her arms--it was in vain--they were separated more than a\ncable's length. Philip made one more desperate struggle, and then fell\ndown deprived of sense and motion.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXIV\n\n\nIt was not until the day had dawned that Philip opened his eyes, and\ndiscovered Krantz kneeling at his side; at first his thoughts were\nscattered and confused; he felt that some dreadful calamity had\nhappened to him, but he could not recall to mind what it was. At last\nit rushed upon him, and he buried his face in his hands.\n\n\"Take comfort,\" said Krantz; \"we shall probably gain the shore to-day,\nand we will go in search of her as soon as we can.\"\n\n\"This, then, is the separation and the cruel death to her which that\nwretch Schriften prophesied to us,\" thought Philip; \"cruel indeed to\nwaste away to a skeleton, under a burning sun, without one drop of\nwater left to cool her parched tongue; at the mercy of the winds and\nwaves; drifting about--alone--all alone--separated from her husband,\nin whose arms she would have died without regret; maddened with\nsuspense and with the thoughts of what I may be suffering, or what may\nhave been my fate. Pilot, you are right; there can be no more cruel\ndeath to a fond and doting wife. Oh! my head reels. What has Philip\nVanderdecken to live for now?\"\n\nKrantz offered such consolation as his friendship could suggest, but\nin vain. He then talked of revenge, and Philip raised his head.\nAfter a few minutes' thought, he rose up. \"Yes,\" replied he,\n\"revenge!--revenge upon those dastards and traitors! Tell me, Krantz,\nhow many can we trust?\"\n\n\"Half of the men, I should think, at least. It was a surprise.\" A spar\nhad been fitted as a rudder, and the raft had now gained nearer the\nshore than it ever had done before. The men were in high spirits at\nthe prospect, and every man was sitting on his own store of dollars,\nwhich, in their eyes, increased in value, in proportion as did their\nprospect of escape.\n\nPhilip discovered from Krantz, that it was the soldiers and the most\nindifferent seamen who had mutinied on the night before, and cut away\nthe other raft; and that all the best men had remained neuter.\n\n\"And so they will be now, I imagine,\" continued Krantz; \"the prospect\nof gaining the shore has, in a manner, reconciled them to the\ntreachery of their companions.\"\n\n\"Probably,\" replied Philip, with a bitter laugh; \"but I know what will\nrouse them. Send them here to me.\"\n\nPhilip talked to the seamen, whom Krantz had sent over to him. He\npointed out to them that the other men were traitors, not to be relied\nupon; that they would sacrifice everything and everybody for their\nown gain; that they had already done so for money, and that they\nthemselves would have no security, either on the raft or on shore,\nwith such people; that they dare not sleep for fear of having their\nthroats cut, and that it were better at once to get rid of those\nwho could not be true to each other; that it would facilitate their\nescape, and that they could divide between themselves the money which\nthe others had secured, and by which they would double their own\nshares. That it had been his intention, although he had said nothing,\nto enforce the restoration of the money for the benefit of the\nCompany, as soon as they had gained a civilised port, where the\nauthorities could interfere; but that, if they consented to join and\naid him, he would now give them the whole of it for their own use.\n\nWhat will not the desire of gain effect? Is it, therefore, to be\nwondered at, that these men, who were indeed but little better than\nthose who were thus, in his desire of retaliation, denounced by\nPhilip, consented to his proposal? It was agreed, that if they did not\ngain the shore, the others should be attacked that very night, and\ntossed into the sea.\n\nBut the consultation with Philip had put the other party on the alert;\nthey, too, held council, and kept their arms by their sides. As the\nbreeze died away, they were not two miles from the land, and once more\nthey drifted back into the ocean. Philip's mind was borne down with\ngrief at the loss of Amine; but it recovered to a certain degree when\nhe thought of revenge: that feeling stayed him up, and he often felt\nthe edge of his cutlass, impatient for the moment of retribution.\n\nIt was a lovely night; the sea was now smooth as glass, and not a\nbreath of air moved in the heavens; the sail of the raft hung listless\ndown the mast, and was reflected upon the calm surface by\nthe brilliancy of the starry night alone. It was a night for\ncontemplation--for examination of oneself, and adoration of the Deity;\nand here, on a frail raft, were huddled together more than forty\nbeings ready for combat, for murder, and for spoil. Each party\npretended to repose; yet each were quietly watching the motions of the\nother, with their hands upon their weapons. The signal was to be given\nby Philip: it was, to let go the halyards of the yard, so that the\nsail should fall down upon a portion of the other party, and entangle\nthem. By Philip's directions, Schriften had taken the helm, and Krantz\nremained by his side.\n\nThe yard and sail fell clattering down, and then the work of death\ncommenced; there was no parley, no suspense; each man started upon his\nfeet and raised his sword. The voices of Philip and of Krantz alone\nwere heard, and Philip's sword did its work. He was nerved to his\nrevenge, and never could be satiated as long as one remained who had\nsacrificed his Amine. As Philip had expected, many had been covered up\nand entangled by the falling of the sail, and their work was thereby\nmade easier.\n\nSome fell where they stood; others reeled back, and sunk down under\nthe smooth water; others were pierced as they floundered under the\ncanvas. In a few minutes, the work of carnage was complete. Schriften\nmeanwhile looked on, and ever and anon gave vent to his chuckling\nlaugh--his demoniacal \"He! he!\"\n\nThe strife was over, and Philip stood against the mast to recover his\nbreath. \"So far art thou revenged, my Amine,\" thought he; \"but, oh!\nwhat are these paltry lives compared to thine?\" And now that his\nrevenge was satiated, and he could do no more, he covered his face up\nin his hands, and wept bitterly, while those who had assisted him were\nalready collecting the money of the slain for distribution. These men,\nwhen they found that three only of their side had fallen, lamented\nthat there had not been more, as their own shares of the dollars would\nhave been increased.\n\nThere were now but thirteen men besides Philip, Krantz, and Schriften\nleft upon the raft. As the day dawned, the breeze again sprung up,\nand they shared out the portions of water, which would have been the\nallowance of their companions who had fallen. Hunger they felt not;\nbut the water revived their spirits.\n\nAlthough Philip had had little to say to Schriften since the\nseparation from Amine, it was very evident to him and to Krantz, that\nall the pilot's former bitter feelings had returned. His chuckle,\nhis sarcasms, his \"He! he!\" were incessant; and his eye was now as\nmaliciously directed to Philip as it was when they first met. It was\nevident that Amine alone had for the time conquered his disposition;\nand that, with her disappearance, had vanished all the good-will of\nSchriften towards her husband. For this Philip cared little; he had a\nmuch more serious weight on his heart--the loss of his dear Amine; and\nhe felt reckless and indifferent concerning anything else.\n\nThe breeze now freshened, and they expected that, in two hours, they\nwould run on the beach, but they were disappointed: the step of the\nmast gave way from the force of the wind, and the sail fell upon the\nraft. This occasioned great delay; and before they could repair the\nmischief, the wind again subsided, and they were left about a mile\nfrom the beach. Tired and worn out with his feelings, Philip at last\nfell asleep by the side of Krantz, leaving Schriften at the helm. He\nslept soundly--he dreamt of Amine--he thought she was under a grove\nof cocoa-nuts in a sweet sleep; that he stood by and watched her, and\nthat she smiled in her sleep, and murmured \"Philip,\" when suddenly he\nwas awakened by some unusual movement. Half-dreaming still, he thought\nthat Schriften, the pilot, had in his sleep been attempting to gain\nhis relic, had passed the chain over his head, and was removing\nquietly from underneath his neck the portion of the chain which, in\nhis reclining posture, he lay upon. Startled at the idea, he threw up\nhis hand to seize the arm of the wretch, and found that he had really\nseized hold of Schriften, who was kneeling by him, and in possession\nof the chain and relic. The struggle was short, the relic was\nrecovered, and the pilot lay at the mercy of Philip, who held him down\nwith his knee on his chest. Philip replaced the relic on his bosom,\nand, excited to madness, rose from the body of the now breathless\nSchriften, caught it in his arms, and hurled it into the sea.\n\n\"Man or devil! I care not which,\" exclaimed Philip, breathless;\n\"escape now, if you can!\"\n\nThe struggle had already roused up Krantz and others, but not in time\nto prevent Philip from wreaking his vengeance upon Schriften. In few\nwords, he told Krantz what had passed; as for the men, they cared not;\nthey laid their heads down again, and, satisfied that their money was\nsafe, inquired no further.\n\nPhilip watched to see if Schriften would rise up again, and try to\nregain the raft; but he did not make his appearance above water, and\nPhilip felt satisfied.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXV\n\n\nWhat pen could portray the feelings of the fond and doting Amine, when\nshe first discovered that she was separated from her husband? In a\nstate of bewilderment, she watched the other raft as the distance\nbetween them increased. At last the shades of night hid it from her\naching eyes, and she dropped down in mute despair.\n\nGradually she recovered herself, and turning round, she exclaimed,\n\"Who's here?\"\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"Who's here?\" cried she in a louder voice; \"alone--alone--and Philip\ngone. Mother, mother, look down upon your unhappy child!\" and Amine\nfrantically threw herself down so near to the edge of the raft, that\nher long hair, which had fallen down, floated on the wave.\n\n\"Ah me! where am I?\" cried Amine, after remaining in a state of torpor\nfor some hours. The sun glared fiercely upon her, and dazzled her eyes\nas she opened them--she cast them on the blue wave close by her, and\nbeheld a large shark motionless by the side of the raft, waiting for\nhis prey. Recoiling from the edge, she started up. She turned round,\nand beheld the raft vacant, and the truth flashed on her. \"Oh! Philip,\nPhilip!\" cried she, \"then it is true, and you are gone for ever! I\nthought it was only a dream, I recollect all now. Yes--all--all!\"\nAnd Amine sank down again upon her cot, which had been placed in the\ncentre of the raft, and remained motionless for some time.\n\nBut the demand for water became imperious; she seized one of the\nbottles, and drank. \"Yet why should I drink or eat? Why should I wish\nto preserve life?\" She rose, and looked round the horizon--\"Sky and\nwater, nothing more. Is this the death I am to die--the cruel death\nprophesied by Schriften--a lingering death under a burning sun, while\nmy vitals are parched within? Be it so! Fate I dare thee to thy\nworst--we can die but once--and without him, what care I to live! But\nyet I may see him again,\" continued Amine, hurriedly, after a pause.\n\"Yes! I may--who knows? Then welcome life, I'll nurse thee for that\nbare hope--bare indeed with nought to feed on. Let me see, is it here\nstill?\" Amine looked at her zone, and perceived her dagger was still\nin it. \"Well then, I will live since death is at my command, and be\nguardful of life for my dear husband's sake.\" And Amine threw herself\non her resting-place that she might forget everything. She did: from\nthat morning till the noon of the next day, she remained in a state of\ntorpor.\n\nWhen she again rose, she was faint; again she looked round her--there\nwas but sky and water to be seen. \"Oh! this solitude--it is horrible!\ndeath would be a release--but no, I must not die--I must live for\nPhilip.\" She refreshed herself with water and a few pieces of biscuit,\nand folded her arms across her breast. \"A few more days without\nrelief, and all must be over. Was ever woman situated as I am, and yet\nI dare to indulge hope? Why, 'tis madness! And why am I thus singled\nout: because I have wedded with Philip? It may be so; if so, I welcome\nit. Wretches! who thus severed me from my husband; who, to save their\nown lives, sacrificed a helpless woman! Nay! they might have saved me,\nif they had had the least pity;--but no, they never felt it. And these\nare Christians! The creed that the old priests would have had me--yes!\nthat Philip would have had me embrace. Charity and good-will! They\ntalk of it, but I have never seen them practise it! Loving one\nanother!--forgiving one another!--say rather hating and preying upon\none another! A creed never practised: why, if not practised, of what\nvalue is it? Any creed were better--I abjure it, and if I be saved,\nwill abjure it still for ever. Shade of my mother! is it that I have\nlistened to these men--that I have, to win my husband's love, tried to\nforget that which thou taughtest, even when a child at thy feet--that\nfaith which our forefathers for thousands of years lived and died\nin--that creed proved by works, and obedience to the prophet's\nwill--is it for this that I am punished? Tell me, mother--oh! tell me\nin my dreams.\"\n\nThe night closed in, and with the gloom rose heavy clouds; the\nlightning darted through the firmament, ever and anon lighting up\nthe raft. At last, the flashes were so rapid, not following each\nother--but darting down from every quarter at once, that the whole\nfirmament appeared as if on fire, and the thunder rolled along the\nheavens, now near and loud, then rumbling in the distance. The breeze\nrose up fresh, and the waves tossed the raft, and washed occasionally\neven to Amine's feet, as she stood in the centre of it.\n\n\"I like this--this is far better than that calm and withering\nheat--this rouses me,\" said Amine, as she cast her eyes up, and\nwatched the forked lightning till her vision became obscured. \"Yes,\nthis is as it should be. Lightning, strike me if you please--waves\nwash me off and bury me in a briny tomb--pour the wrath of the whole\nelements upon this devoted head.--I care not, I laugh at, I defy it\nall. Thou canst but kill, this little steel can do as much. Let those\nwho hoard up wealth--those who live in splendour--those that are\nhappy--those who have husbands, children, aught to love--let them\ntremble, I have nothing. Elements! be ye fire, or water, or earth, or\nair, Amine defies you! And yet--no, no, deceive not thyself, Amine,\nthere is no hope; thus will I mount my funeral bier, and wait the will\nof destiny.\" And Amine regained the secure place which Philip had\nfitted up for her in the centre of the raft, threw herself down upon\nher bed, and shut her eyes.\n\nThe thunder and lightning was followed up by torrents of heavy rain,\nwhich fell till daylight; the wind still continued fresh, but the sky\ncleared, and the sun shone out. Amine remained shivering in her wet\ngarments; the heat of the sun proved too powerful for her exhausted\nstate, and her brain wandered. She rose up in a sitting posture,\nlooked around her, saw verdant fields in every direction, the\ncocoa-nuts waving to the wind--imagined even that she saw her own\nPhilip in the distance hastening to her; she held out her arms; strove\nto get up, and run to meet him, but her limbs refused their office;\nshe called to him, she screamed, and sank back exhausted on her\nresting-place.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXVI\n\n\nWe must for a time return to Philip, and follow his strange destiny. A\nfew hours after he had thrown the pilot into the sea they gained the\nshore, so long looked at with anxiety and suspense. The spars of the\nraft, jerked by the running swell, undulated and rubbed against each\nother, as they rose and fell to the waves breaking on the beach. The\nbreeze was fresh, but the surf was trifling, and the landing was\nwithout difficulty. The beach was shelving, of firm white sand,\ninterspersed and strewed with various brilliant-coloured shells; and\nhere and there, the bleached fragments and bones of some animal which\nhad been forced out of its element to die. The island was, like all\nthe others, covered with a thick wood of cocoa-nut trees, whose tops\nwaved to the breeze, or bowed to the blast, producing a shade and a\nfreshness which would have been duly appreciated by any other party\nthan the present, with the exception only of Krantz; for Philip\nthought of nothing but his lost wife, and the seamen thought of\nnothing but of their sudden wealth. Krantz supported Philip to the\nbeach and led him to the shade; but after a minute he rose, and\nrunning down to the nearest point, looked anxiously for the portion\nof the raft which held Amine, which was now far, far away. Krantz had\nfollowed, aware that, now the first paroxysms were past, there was no\nfear of Philip's throwing away his life.\n\n\"Gone, gone for ever!\" exclaimed Philip, pressing his hands to the\nballs of his eyes.\n\n\"Not so, Philip, the same Providence which has preserved us, will\ncertainly assist her. It is impossible that she can perish among so\nmany islands, many of which are inhabited; and a woman will be certain\nof kind treatment.\"\n\n\"If I could only think so,\" replied Philip.\n\n\"A little reflection may induce you to think that it is rather an\nadvantage than otherwise, that she is thus separated--not from you,\nbut from so many lawless companions, whose united force we could\nnot resist. Do you think that, after any lengthened sojourn on this\nisland, these people with us would permit you to remain in quiet\npossession of your wife? No!--they would respect no laws; and Amine\nhas, in my opinion, been miraculously preserved from shame and\nill-treatment, if not from death.\"\n\n\"They durst not, surely! Well, but Krantz, we must make a raft and\nfollow her; we must not remain here--I will seek her through the wide\nworld.\"\n\n\"Be it so, if you wish, Philip, and I will follow your fortunes,\"\nreplied Krantz, glad to find that there was something, however wild\nthe idea, for his mind to feed on. \"But now let us return to the\nraft, seek the refreshment we so much require, and after that we will\nconsider what may be the best plan to pursue.\"\n\nTo this, Philip, who was much exhausted, tacitly consented, and he\nfollowed Krantz to where the raft had been beached. The men had left\nit, and were each of them sitting apart from one another under the\nshade of his own chosen cocoa-nut tree. The articles which had been\nsaved on the raft had not been landed, and Krantz called upon them to\ncome and carry the things on shore--but no one would answer or obey.\nThey each sat watching their money, and afraid to leave it, lest they\nshould be dispossessed of it by the others. Now that their lives were,\ncomparatively speaking, safe, the demon of avarice had taken full\npossession of their souls; there they sat, exhausted, pining for\nwater, and longing for sleep, and yet they dared not move--they were\nfixed as if by the wand of the enchanter.\n\n\"It is the cursed dollars which have turned their brains,\" observed\nKrantz to Philip; \"let us try if we cannot manage to remove what we\nmost stand in need of, and then we will search for water.\"\n\nPhilip and Krantz collected the carpenter's tools, the best arms, and\nall the ammunition, as the possession of the latter would give them\nadvantage in case of necessity; they then dragged on shore the sail\nand some small spars, all of which they carried up to a clump of\ncocoa-nut trees, about a hundred yards from the beach.\n\nIn half an hour they had erected an humble tent, and put into it what\nthey had brought with them, with the exception of the major part of\nthe ammunition, which, as soon as he was screened by the tent, Krantz\nburied in a heap of dry sand behind it; he then, for their immediate\nwants, cut down with an axe a small cocoa-nut tree in full bearing. It\nmust be for those who have suffered the agony of prolonged thirst, to\nknow the extreme pleasure with which the milk of the nuts were one\nafter the other poured down the parched throats of Krantz and Philip.\nThe men witnessed their enjoyment in silence, and with gloating eyes.\nEvery time that a fresh cocoa-nut was seized and its contents quaffed\nby their officers, more sharp and agonising was their own devouring\nthirst--still closer did their dry lips glue themselves together--yet\nthey moved not, although they felt the tortures of the condemned.\n\nEvening closed in; Philip had thrown himself down on the spare sails,\nand had fallen asleep, when Krantz set off to explore the island upon\nwhich they had been thrown. It was small, not exceeding three miles in\nlength, and at no one part more than five hundred yards across. Water\nthere was none, unless it were to be obtained by digging; fortunately\nthe young cocoa-nuts prevented the absolute necessity for it. On his\nreturn, Krantz passed the men in their respective stations. Each was\nawake, and raised himself on his elbow to ascertain if it were an\nassailant; but perceiving Krantz, they again dropped down. Krantz\npassed the raft--the water was now quite smooth, for the wind had\nshifted off shore, and the spars which composed the raft hardly\njostled each other. He stepped upon it, and, as the moon was bright in\nthe heavens, he took the precaution of collecting all the arms which\nhad been left, and throwing them as far as he could into the sea. He\nthen walked to the tent, where he found Philip still sleeping soundly,\nand in a few minutes he was reposing by his side. And Philip's dreams\nwere of Amine; he thought that he saw the hated Schriften rise again\nfrom the waters, and, climbing up to the raft, seat himself by her\nside. He thought that he again heard his unearthly chuckle and his\nscornful laugh, as his unwelcome words fell upon her distracted ears.\nHe thought that she fled into the sea to avoid Schriften, and that the\nwaters appeared to reject her--she floated on the surface. The storm\nrose, and once more he beheld her in the sea-shell skimming over the\nwaves. Again, she was in a furious surf on the beach, and her shell\nsank, and she was buried in the waves; and then he saw her walking on\nshore without fear and without harm, for the water which spared\nno one, appeared to spare her. Philip tried to join her, but was\nprevented by some unknown power, and Amine waved her hand and said,\n\"We shall meet again, Philip; yes, once more on this earth shall we\nmeet again.\"\n\nThe sun was high in the heavens and scorching in his heat, when Krantz\nfirst opened his eyes, and awakened Philip. The axe again procured for\nthem their morning's meal. Philip, was silent; he was ruminating upon\nhis dreams, which had afforded him consolation. \"We shall meet again!\"\nthought he. \"Yes, once more at least we shall meet again. Providence!\nI thank thee.\"\n\nKrantz then stepped out to ascertain the condition of the men. He\nfound them faint, and so exhausted, that they could not possibly\nsurvive much longer, yet still watching over their darling treasure.\nIt was melancholy to witness such perversion of intellect, and Krantz\nthought of a plan which might save their lives. He proposed to them\neach separately, that they should bury their money so deep, that it\nwas not to be recovered without time: this would prevent any one from\nattacking the treasure of the other, without its being perceived\nand the attempt frustrated, and would enable them to obtain their\nnecessary food and refreshment without danger of being robbed.\n\nTo this plan they acceded. Krantz brought out of the tent the only\nshovel in their possession, and they, one by one, buried their dollars\nmany feet deep in the yielding sand. When they had all secured their\nwealth, he brought them one of the axes, and the cocoa-nut trees\nfell, and they were restored to new life and vigour. Having satiated\nthemselves, they then lay down upon the several spots under which they\nhad buried their dollars, and were soon enjoying that repose which\nthey all so much needed.\n\nPhilip and Krantz had now many serious consultations as to the means\nwhich should be taken for quitting the island, and going in search\nof Amine; for although Krantz thought the latter part of Philip's\nproposal useless, he did not venture to say so. To quit this island\nwas necessary; and provided they gained one of those which were\ninhabited, it was all that they could expect. As for Amine, he\nconsidered that she was dead before this, either having been washed\noff the raft, or that her body was lying on it exposed to the\ndecomposing heat of a torrid sun.\n\nTo cheer Philip, he expressed himself otherwise; and whenever they\ntalked about leaving the island, it was not to save their own lives,\nbut invariably to search after Philip's lost wife. The plan which they\nproposed and acted upon was, to construct a light raft, the centre to\nbe composed of three water-casks, sawed in half, in a row behind each\nother, firmly fixed by cross pieces to two long spars on each side.\nThis, under sail, would move quickly through the water, and be\nmanageable so as to enable them to steer a course. The outside spars\nhad been selected and hauled on shore, and the work was already in\nprogress; but they were left alone in their work, for the seamen\nappeared to have no idea at present of quitting the island. Restored\nby food and repose, they were not content with the money which they\nhad--they were anxious for more. A portion of each party's wealth had\nbeen dug up, and they now gambled all day with pebbles, which they\nhad collected on the beach, and with which they had invented a game.\nAnother evil had crept among them: they had cut steps in the largest\ncocoa-nut trees, and with the activity of seamen had mounted them,\nand by tapping the top of the trees, and fixing empty cocoa-nuts\nunderneath, had obtained the liquor, which in its first fermentation\nis termed toddy, and is afterwards distilled into arrack. But as\ntoddy, it is quite sufficient to intoxicate; and every day the scenes\nof violence and intoxication, accompanied with oaths and execrations,\nbecame more and more dreadful. The losers tore their hair, and rushed\nlike madmen upon those who had gained their dollars; but Krantz had\nfortunately thrown their weapons into the sea, and those he had saved,\nas well as the ammunition, he had secreted.\n\nBlows and bloodshed, therefore, were continual, but loss of life there\nwas none, as the contending parties were separated by the others, who\nwere anxious that the play should not be interrupted. Such had been\nthe state of affairs for now nearly a fortnight, while the work of the\nraft had slowly proceeded. Some of the men had lost their all, and\nhad, by the general consent of those who had won their wealth, been\nbanished to a certain distance that they might not pilfer from them.\nThese walked gloomily round the island, or on the beach, seeking\nsome instrument by which they might avenge themselves, and obtain\nrepossession of their money. Krantz and Philip had proposed to these\nmen to join them, and leave the island, but they had sullenly refused.\n\nThe axe was now never parted with by Krantz. He cut down what\ncocoa-nut trees they required for subsistence, and prevented the men\nfrom notching more trees, to procure the means of inebriation. On the\nsixteenth day, all the money had passed into the hands of three men\nwho had been more fortunate than the rest. The losers were now by\nfar the more numerous party, and the consequence was, that the next\nmorning these three men were found lying strangled on the beach; the\nmoney had been redivided, and the gambling had recommenced with more\nvigour than ever.\n\n\"How can this end?\" exclaimed Philip to Krantz, as he looked upon the\nblackened countenances of the murdered men.\n\n\"In the death of all,\" replied Krantz. \"We cannot prevent it. It is a\njudgment.\"\n\nThe raft was now ready; the sand had been dug from beneath it, so as\nto allow the water to flow in and float it, and it was now made fast\nto a stake, and riding on the peaceful waters. A large store of\ncocoa-nuts, old and young, had been procured and put on board of her,\nand it was the intention of Philip and Krantz to have quitted the\nisland the next day.\n\nUnfortunately, one of the men, when bathing, had perceived the arms\nlying in the shallow water. He had dived down and procured a cutlass;\nothers had followed his example, and all had armed themselves. This\ninduced Philip and Krantz to sleep on board of the raft, and keep\nwatch; and that night, as the play was going on, a heavy loss on one\nside ended in a general fray. The combat was furious, for all were\nmore or less excited by intoxication. The result was melancholy, for\nonly three were left alive. Philip, with Krantz, watched the issue;\nevery man who fell wounded was put to the sword, and the three left,\nwho had been fighting on the same side, rested panting on their\nweapons. After a pause, two of them communicated with each other, and\nthe result was an attack upon the third man, who fell dead beneath\ntheir blows.\n\n\"Merciful Father! are these Thy creatures?\" exclaimed Philip.\n\n\"No!\" replied Krantz, \"they worshipped the devil as Mammon. Do you\nimagine that those two, who could now divide more wealth than they\ncould well spend if they return to their country, will consent to a\ndivision? Never!--they must have all--yes, all.\"\n\nKrantz had hardly expressed his opinion, when one of the men, taking\nadvantage of the other turning round a moment from him, passed his\nsword through his back. The man fell with a groan, and the sword was\nagain passed through his body.\n\n\"Said I not so? But the treacherous villain shall not reap his\nreward,\" continued Krantz, levelling the musket which he held in his\nhand, and shooting him dead.\n\n\"You have done wrong, Krantz; you have saved him from the punishment\nhe deserved. Left alone on the island, without the means of obtaining\nhis subsistence, he must have perished miserably and by inches, with\nall his money round him--that would have been torture indeed!\"\n\n\"Perhaps I was wrong. If so, may Providence forgive me, I could not\nhelp it. Let us go ashore, for we are now on this island alone. We\nmust collect the treasure and bury it, so that it may be recovered;\nand, at the same time, take a portion with us--for who knows but that\nwe may have occasion for it. To-morrow we had better remain here, for\nwe shall have enough to do in burying the bodies of these infatuated\nmen, and the wealth which has caused their destruction.\"\n\nPhilip agreed to the propriety of the suggestion; the next day they\nburied the bodies where they lay; and the treasure was all collected\nin a deep trench, under a cocoa-nut tree, which they carefully marked\nwith their axe. About five hundred pieces of gold were selected and\ntaken on board of the raft, with the intention of secreting them about\ntheir persons, and resorting to them in case of need.\n\nThe following morning they hoisted their sail and quitted the island.\nNeed it be said in what direction they steered? As may be well\nimagined, in that quarter where they had last seen the raft with the\nisolated Amine.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXVII\n\n\nThe raft was found to answer well; and although her progress through\nthe water was not very rapid, she obeyed the helm and was under\ncommand. Both Philip and Krantz were very careful in taking such marks\nand observations of the island as should enable them, if necessary,\nto find it again. With the current to assist them, they now proceeded\nrapidly to the southward, in order that they might examine a large\nisland which lay in that direction. Their object, after seeking for\nAmine, was to find out the direction of Ternate; the king of which\nthey knew to be at variance with the Portuguese, who had a fort and\nfactory at Tidore, not very far distant from it; and from thence to\nobtain a passage in one of the Chinese junks, which, on their way to\nBantam, called at that island.\n\nTowards evening they had neared the large island, and they soon ran\ndown it close to the beach. Philip's eyes wandered in every direction\nto ascertain whether anything on the shore indicated the presence of\nAmine's raft, but he could perceive nothing of the kind, nor did he\nsee any inhabitants.\n\nThat they might not pass the object of their search during the night,\nthey ran their raft on shore, in a small cove, where the waters were\nquite smooth, and remained there until the next morning, when they\nagain made sail and prosecuted their voyage. Krantz was steering with\nthe long sweep they had fitted for the purpose, when he observed\nPhilip, who had been for some time silent, take from his breast the\nrelic which he wore, and gaze attentively upon it.\n\n\"Is that your picture, Philip?\" observed Krantz.\n\n\"Alas! No, it is my destiny,\" replied Philip, answering without\nreflection.\n\n\"Your destiny! What mean you?\"\n\n\"Did I say my destiny? I hardly know what I said,\" replied Philip,\nreplacing the relic in his bosom.\n\n\"I rather think you said more than you intended,\" replied Krantz, \"but\nat the same time, something near the truth. I have often perceived you\nwith that trinket in your hand, and I have not forgotten how anxious\nSchriften was to obtain it, and the consequences of his attempt upon\nit. Is there not some secret--some mystery attached to it? Surely,\nif so, you must now sufficiently know me as your friend, to feel me\nworthy of your confidence.\"\n\n\"That you are my friend, Krantz, I feel--my sincere and much valued\nfriend, for we have shared much danger together, and that is\nsufficient to make us friends--that I could trust you, I believe, but\nI feel as if I dare not trust anyone. There is a mystery attached to\nthis relic (for a relic it is), which as yet has been confided to my\nwife and holy men alone.\"\n\n\"And if trusted to holy men, surely it may be trusted to sincere\nfriendship, than which nothing is more holy.\"\n\n\"But I have a presentiment that the knowledge of my secret would prove\nfatal to you. Why I feel such a presentiment I know not; but I feel\nit, Krantz; and I cannot afford to lose you, my valued friend.\"\n\n\"You will not, then, make use of my friendship, it appears,\" replied\nKrantz. \"I have risked my life with you before now, and I am not to\nbe deterred from the duties of friendship by a childish foreboding on\nyour part, the result of an agitated mind and a weakened body. Can\nanything be more absurd than to suppose, that a secret confided to me\ncan be pregnant with danger, unless it be, indeed, that my zeal\nto assist you may lead me into difficulties. I am not of a prying\ndisposition; but we have been so long connected together, and are now\nso isolated from the rest of the world, that it appears to me it would\nbe a solace to you, were you to confide in one whom you can trust,\nwhat evidently has long preyed upon your mind. The consolation and\nadvice of a friend, Philip, are not to be despised, and you will feel\nrelieved if able to talk over with him a subject which evidently\noppresses you. If, therefore, you value my friendship, let me share\nwith you in your sorrows.\"\n\nThere are few who have passed through life so quietly, as not to\nrecollect how much grief has been assuaged by confiding its cause to,\nand listening to the counsels and consolations of, some dear friend.\nIt must not therefore appear surprising, that, situated as he was, and\noppressed with the loss of Amine, Philip should regard Krantz as one\nto whom he might venture to confide his important secret. He commenced\nhis narrative with no injunctions, for he felt that if Krantz could\nnot respect his secret for his secret's sake, or from good-will\ntowards him, he was not likely to be bound by any promise; and as,\nduring the day, the raft passed by the various small capes and\nheadlands of the island, he poured into Krantz's ear the history which\nthe reader is acquainted with. \"Now you know all,\" said Philip with\na deep sigh, as the narrative was concluded. \"What think you? Do you\ncredit my strange tale, or do you imagine, as some well would, that it\nis a mere phantom of a disordered brain?\"\n\n\"That it is not so, Philip, I believe,\" replied Krantz; \"for I too\nhave had ocular proof of the correctness of a part of your history.\nRemember how often I have seen this Phantom Ship--and if your father\nis permitted to range over the seas, why should you not be selected\nand permitted to reverse his doom? I fully believe every word that you\nhave told me, and since you have told me this, I can comprehend much\nthat in your behaviour at times appeared unaccountable; there are many\nwho would pity you, Philip, but I envy you.\"\n\n\"Envy me?\" cried Philip.\n\n\"Yes! envy you: and gladly would I take the burden of your doom on my\nown shoulders, were it only possible. Is it not a splendid thought\nthat you are summoned to so great a purpose,--that instead of roaming\nthrough the world as we all do in pursuit of wealth, which possibly we\nmay lose after years of cost and hardship, by the venture of a day,\nand which, at all events, we must leave behind us,--you are selected\nto fulfil a great and glorious work--the work of angels, I may\nsay--that of redeeming the soul of a father, _suffering_ indeed, for\nhis human frailties, but not doomed to perish for eternity; you have,\nindeed, an object of pursuit worthy of all the hardships and dangers\nof a maritime life. If it ends in your death, what then? Where else\nend our futile cravings, our continual toil, after nothing? We all\nmust die--but how few--who indeed besides yourself--was ever permitted\nbefore his death to ransom the soul of the author of his existence!\nYes, Philip, I envy you!\"\n\n\"You think and speak like Amine. She too is of a wild and ardent\nsoul, that would mingle with the beings of the other world, and hold\nintelligence with disembodied spirits.\"\n\n\"She is right,\" replied Krantz; \"there are events in my life, or\nrather connected with my family, which have often fully convinced me\nthat this is not only possible but permitted. Your story has only\ncorroborated what I already believed.\"\n\n\"Indeed! Krantz?\"\n\n\"Indeed, yes; but of that hereafter: the night is closing in, we must\nagain put our little bark in safety for the night, and there is a cove\nwhich I think appears suited for the purpose.\"\n\nBefore morning, a strong breeze right on shore had sprung up, and the\nsurf became so high as to endanger the raft; to continue their course\nwas impossible; they could only haul up their raft to prevent its\nbeing dashed to pieces by the force of the waves, as the seas broke\non the shore. Philip's thoughts were, as usual, upon Amine, and as he\nwatched the tossing waters, as the sunbeams lightened up their crests,\nhe exclaimed, \"Ocean! hast thou my Amine? If so, give up thy dead!\nWhat is that?\" continued he, pointing to a speck on the horizon.\n\n\"The sail of a small craft of some description or another,\" replied\nKrantz; \"and apparently coming down before the wind to shelter herself\nin the very nook we have selected.\"\n\n\"You are right; it is the sail of a vessel, of one of those peroquas\nwhich skim over these seas--how she rises on the swell!--she is full\nof men, apparently.\"\n\nThe peroqua rapidly approached, and was soon close to the beach; the\nsail was lowered, and she was backed in through the surf.\n\n\"Resistance is useless should they prove enemies,\" observed Philip.\n\"We shall soon know our fate.\"\n\nThe people in the peroqua took no notice of them, until the craft had\nbeen hauled up and secured; three of them then advanced towards Philip\nand Krantz, with spears in their hands, but evidently with no hostile\nintentions. One addressed them in Portuguese, asking them who they\nwere?\n\n\"We are Hollanders,\" replied Philip.\n\n\"A part of the crew of the vessel which was wrecked?\" inquired he.\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"You have nothing to fear--you are enemies to the Portuguese, and so\nare we. We belong to the island of Ternate--our king is at war with\nthe Portuguese, who are villains. Where are your companions? on which\nisland?\"\n\n\"They are all dead,\" replied Philip; \"may I ask you whether you have\nfallen in with a woman, who was adrift on a part of the raft by\nherself? or have you heard of her?\"\n\n\"We have heard that a woman was picked up on the beach to the\nsouthward, and carried away by the Tidore people to the Portuguese\nsettlement, on the supposition that she was a Portuguese.\"\n\n\"Then God be thanked, she is saved,\" cried Philip. \"Merciful Heaven!\naccept my thanks.--To Tidore you said?\"\n\n\"Yes; we are at war with the Portuguese, we cannot take you there.\"\n\n\"No! but we shall meet again.\"\n\nThe person who accosted them was evidently of some consequence. His\ndress was, to a certain degree, Mahometan, but mixed up with Malay--he\ncarried arms in his girdle and a spear in his hand; his turban was of\nprinted chintz; and his deportment, like most persons of rank in that\ncountry, was courteous and dignified.\n\n\"We are now returning to Ternate, and will take you with us. Our king\nwill be pleased to receive any Hollanders, especially as you are\nenemies to the Portuguese dogs. I forgot to tell you that we have one\nof your companions with us in the boat; we picked him up at sea, much\nexhausted, but he is now doing well.\"\n\n\"Who can it be?\" observed Krantz, \"it must be some one belonging to\nsome other vessel.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Philip, shuddering, \"it must be Schriften.\"\n\n\"Then my eyes must behold him before I believe it,\" replied Krantz.\n\n\"Then believe your eyes,\" replied Philip, pointing to the form of\nSchriften, who was now walking towards them.\n\n\"Mynheer Vanderdecken, glad to see you. Mynheer Krantz, I hope you are\nwell. How lucky that we should all be saved. He! he!\"\n\n\"The ocean has then, indeed, given up its dead, as I requested,\"\nthought Philip.\n\nIn the meantime, Schriften, without making any reference to the way\nin which they had so unceremoniously parted company, addressed Krantz\nwith apparent good-humour, and some slight tinge of sarcasm. It was\nsome time before Krantz could rid himself of him.\n\n\"What think you of him, Krantz?\"\n\n\"That he is a part of the whole, and has his destiny to fulfil as well\nas you. He has his part to play in this wondrous mystery, and will\nremain until it is finished. Think not of him. Recollect, your Amine\nis safe.\"\n\n\"True,\" replied Philip, \"the wretch is not worth a thought; we have\nnow nothing to do but to embark with these people; hereafter we may\nrid ourselves of him, and strive then to rejoin my dearest Amine.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXVIII\n\n\nWhen Amine again came to her senses, she found herself lying on the\nleaves of the palmetto, in a small hut. A hideous black child sat by\nher, brushing off the flies. Where was she?\n\nThe raft had been tossed about for two days, during which Amine\nremained in a state of alternate delirium and stupor. Driven by the\ncurrent and the gale, it had been thrown on shore on the eastern end\nof the coast of New Guinea. She had been discovered by some of the\nnatives, who happened to be on the beach trafficking with some of the\nTidore people. At first, they hastened to rid her of her garments,\nalthough they perceived that she was not dead; but before they had\nleft her as naked as themselves, a diamond of great value, which had\nbeen given to her by Philip, attracted the attention of one of the\nsavages; failing in his attempt to pull it off, he pulled out a rusty,\nblunt knife, and was busily sawing at the finger, when an old woman of\nauthority interfered and bade him desist. The Tidore people, also, who\nwere friends with the Portuguese, pointed out, that to save one of\nthat nation would ensure a reward; they stated moreover, that they\nwould, on their return, inform the people of the factory establishment\nthat one of their country-women had been thrown on shore on a\nraft.--To this Amine owed the care and attention that was paid to\nher; that part of New Guinea being somewhat civilised by occasional\nintercourse with the Tidore people, who came there to exchange\nEuropean finery and trash for the more useful productions of the\nisland.\n\nThe Papoos woman carried Amine into her hut, and there she lay for\nmany days, wavering between life and death, carefully attended, but\nrequiring little, except the moistening of her parched lips with\nwater, and the brushing off of the mosquitoes and flies.\n\nWhen Amine opened her eyes, the little Papoos ran out to acquaint\nthe woman who followed her into the hut. She was of large size, very\ncorpulent and unwieldy, with little covering on her body; her hair,\nwhich was woolly in its texture, was partly parted, partly frizzled;\na cloth round her waist, and a piece of faded yellow silk on her\nshoulders, was all her dress. A few silver rings on her fat fingers,\nand a necklace of mother-of-pearl, were her ornaments. Her teeth were\njet black, from the use of the betel-nut, and her whole appearance was\nsuch as to excite disgust in the breast of Amine.\n\nShe addressed Amine, but her words were unintelligible: and the\nsufferer, exhausted with the slight effort she had made, fell back\ninto her former position, and closed her eyes. But if the woman was\ndisgusting, she was kind; and by her attention and care Amine was\nable, in the course of three weeks, to crawl out of the hut and enjoy\nthe evening breeze. The natives of the island would at times surround\nher, but they treated her with respect, from fear of the old woman.\nTheir woolly hair was frizzled or plaited, sometimes powdered white\nwith chunam. A few palmetto leaves round the waist and descending to\nthe knee, was their only attire; rings through the nose and ears,\nand feathers of birds, particularly the bird of paradise, were their\nornaments: but their language was wholly unintelligble. Amine felt\ngrateful for life; she sat under the shade of the trees, and watched\nthe swift peroquas as they skimmed the blue sea which was expanded\nbefore her; but her thoughts were elsewhere--they were on Philip.\n\nOne morning Amine came out of the hut, with joy on her countenance,\nand took her usual seat under the trees. \"Yes, mother, dearest mother,\nI thank thee; thou hast appeared to me; thou hast recalled to me thy\narts, which I had forgotten, and had I but the means of conversing\nwith these people, even now would I know where my Philip might be.\"\n\nFor two months did Amine remain under the care of the Papoos woman.\nWhen the Tidore people returned, they had an order to bring the white\nwoman, who had been cast on shore, to the Factory, and repay those who\nhad taken charge of her. They made signs to Amine, who had now quite\nrecovered her beauty, that she was to go with them. Any change was\npreferable to staying where she was, and Amine followed them down to a\nperoqua, on which she was securely fixed, and was soon darting through\nthe water with her new companions; and, as they flew along the smooth\nseas, Amine thought of Philip's dream and the mermaid's shell.\n\nBy the evening they had arrived at the southern point of Galolo, where\nthey landed for the night; the next day they gained the place of their\ndestination, and Amine was led up to the Portuguese factory.\n\nThat the curiosity of those who were stationed there was roused is not\nto be wondered at, the history given by the natives of Amine's escape\nappeared so miraculous. From the Commandant to the lowest servant,\nevery one was waiting to receive her. The beauty of Amine, her perfect\nform, astonished them. The Commandant addressed a long compliment to\nher in Portuguese, and was astonished that she did not make a suitable\nreply; but as Amine did not understand a word that he said, it would\nhave been more surprising if she had.\n\nAs Amine made signs that she could not understand the language, it was\npresumed that she was either English or Dutch, and an interpreter was\nsent for. She then explained that she was the wife of a Dutch captain,\nwhose vessel had been wrecked, and that she did not know whether the\ncrew had been saved or not. The Portuguese were very glad to hear\nthat a Dutch vessel had been wrecked, and very glad that so lovely a\ncreature as Amine had been saved. She was informed by the Commandant\nthat she was welcome, and that during her stay there everything should\nbe done to make her comfortable; that in three months they expected\na vessel from the Chinese seas, proceeding to Goa, and that, if\ninclined, she should have a passage to Goa in that vessel, and from\nthat city she would easily find other vessels to take her wherever she\nmight please to go; she was then conducted to an apartment, and left\nwith a little negress to attend upon her.\n\nThe Portuguese Commandant was a small, meagre, little man, dried up to\na chip, from long sojourning under a tropical sun. He had very large\nwhiskers, and a very long sword; these were the two most remarkable\nfeatures in his person and dress.\n\nHis attentions could not be misinterpreted, and Amine would have\nlaughed at him, had she not been fearful that she might be detained.\nIn a few weeks, by due attention, she gained the Portuguese language\nso far as to ask for what she required, and before she quitted the\nisland of Tidore she could converse fluently. But her anxiety to\nleave, and to ascertain what had become of Philip, became greater\nevery day; and at the expiration of the three months, her eyes were\ncontinually bent to seaward, to catch the first glimpse of the vessel\nwhich was expected. At last it appeared, and as Amine watched the\napproach of the canvas from the west, the Commandant fell on his\nknees, and declaring his passion, requested her not to think of\ndeparture, but to unite her fate with his.\n\nAmine was cautious in her reply, for she knew that she was in his\npower. \"She must first receive intelligence of her husband's death,\nwhich was not yet certain; she would proceed to Goa, and if she\ndiscovered that she was single, she would write to him.\"\n\nThis answer, as it will be discovered, was the cause of great\nsuffering to Philip: the Commandant, fully assured that he could\ncompass Philip's death, was satisfied--declared that, as soon as he\nhad any positive intelligence, he would bring it to Goa himself, and\nmade a thousand protestations of truth and fidelity.\n\n\"Fool!\" thought Amine, as she watched the ship, which was now close to\nthe anchorage.\n\nIn half-an-hour the vessel had anchored, and the people had landed.\nAmine observed a priest with them, as they walked up to the fort. She\nshuddered--she knew not why; when they arrived, she found herself in\nthe presence of Father Mathias.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXIX\n\n\nBoth Amine and Father Mathias started, and drew back with surprise at\nthis unexpected meeting. Amine was the first to extend her hand;\nshe had almost forgotten at the moment how they had parted, in the\npleasure she experienced in meeting with a well-known face.\n\nFather Mathias coldly took her hand, and laying his own upon her head,\nsaid: \"May God bless thee, and forgive thee, my daughter, as I have\nlong done.\" Then the recollection of what had passed, rushed into\nAmine's mind, and she coloured deeply.\n\nHad Father Mathias forgiven her? The event would show; but this is\ncertain, he now treated her as an old friend: listened with interest\nto her history of the wreck, and agreed with her upon the propriety of\nher accompanying him to Goa.\n\nIn a few days the vessel sailed, and Amine quitted the Factory and its\nenamoured Commandant. They ran through the Archipelago in safety, and\nwere crossing the mouth of the Bay of Bengal, without having had any\ninterruption to fine weather. Father Mathias had returned to Lisbon,\nwhen he quitted Ternicore, and, tired of idleness, had again\nvolunteered to proceed as a missionary to India. He had arrived at\nFormosa, and shortly after his arrival, had received directions from\nhis superior to return on important business to Goa, and thus it was\nthat he fell in with Amine at Tidore.\n\nIt would be difficult to analyse the feelings of Father Mathias\ntowards Amine--they varied so often. At one moment, he would call to\nmind the kindness shown to him by her and Philip--the regard he had\nfor the husband, and the many good qualities which he acknowledged\nthat she possessed--and _now_ he would recollect the disgrace, the\nunmerited disgrace, he had suffered through her means; and he would\nthen canvass, whether she really did believe him an intruder in her\nchamber for other motives than those which actuated him, or whether\nshe had taken advantage of his indiscretion. These accounts were\nnearly balanced in his mind; he could have forgiven all, if he had\nthought that Amine was a sincere convert to the church; but his strong\nconviction that she was not only an unbeliever, but that she practised\nforbidden arts, turned the scale against her. He watched her narrowly,\nand when, in her conversation, she shewed any religious feeling, his\nheart warmed towards her; but when, on the contrary, any words escaped\nher lips which seemed to show that she thought lightly of his creed,\nthen the full tide of indignation and vengeance poured into his bosom.\n\nIt was in crossing the Bay of Bengal, to pass round the southern cape\nof Ceylon, that they first met with bad weather; and when the storm\nincreased, the superstitious seamen lighted candles before the small\nimage of the saint which was shrined on deck. Amine observed it,\nand smiled with scorn; and as she did so, almost unwittingly, she\nperceived that the eye of Father Mathias was earnestly fixed upon her.\n\n\"The Papooses I have just left do no worse than worship their idols,\nand are termed idolaters,\" muttered Amine. \"What then are these\nChristians?\"\n\n\"Would you not be better below?\" said Father Mathias, coming over to\nAmine; \"this is no time for women to be on deck--they would be better\nemployed in offering up prayers for safety.\"\n\n\"Nay, Father, I can pray better here; I like this conflict of the\nelements; and as I view, I bow down in admiration of the Deity who\nrules the storm; who sends the winds forth in their wrath, or soothes\nthem into peace.\"\n\n\"It is well said, my child,\" replied Father Mathias; \"but the Almighty\nis not only to be worshipped in His works, but, in the closet, with\nmeditation, self-examination, and faith. Hast thou followed up the\nprecepts which thou hast been taught? hast thou reverenced the sublime\nmysteries which have been unfolded to thee?\"\n\n\"I have done my best, Father,\" replied Amine, turning away her head,\nand watching the rolling wave.\n\n\"Hast thou called upon the Holy Virgin, and upon the saints--those\nintercessors for mortals erring like thyself?\"\n\nAmine made no answer; she did not wish to irritate the priest, neither\nwould she tell an untruth.\n\n\"Answer me, child,\" continued the priest with severity.\n\n\"Father,\" replied Amine, \"I have appealed to God alone--the God of the\nChristians--the God of the whole universe!\"\n\n\"Who believes not everything, believes nothing, young woman. I thought\nas much! I saw thee smile with scorn just now; why didst thou smile?\"\n\n\"At my own thoughts, good Father.\"\n\n\"Say rather, at the true faith shown by others.\"\n\nAmine made no answer.\n\n\"Thou art still an unbeliever, and a heretic. Beware, young woman!\nbeware!\"\n\n\"Beware of what, good Father? why should I beware? Are there not\nmillions in these climes more unbelieving, and more heretic, perhaps,\nthan I? How many have you converted to your faith? What trouble, what\ntoil, what dangers have you not undergone to propagate that creed--and\nwhy do you succeed so ill? Shall I tell you, Father? It is because the\npeople have already had a creed of their own: a creed taught to them\nfrom their infancy, and acknowledged by all who live about them. Am I\nnot in the same position? I was brought up in another creed: and can\nyou expect that that can be dismissed, and the prejudices of early\nyears at once eradicated? I have thought much of what you have told\nme--have felt that much is true--that the tenets of your creed are\ngod-like--is not that much? and yet you are not content. You would\nhave blind acknowledgment, blind obedience--I were then an unworthy\nconvert. We shall soon be in port, then teach me, and convince me, if\nyou will; I am ready to examine and confess, but on conviction only.\nHave patience, good Father, and the time may come when I _may_ feel,\nwhat now I _do not_;--that yon bit of painted wood is a thing to bow\ndown to and adore.\"\n\nNotwithstanding this taunt at the close of this speech, there was so\nmuch truth in the observations of Amine, that Father Mathias felt\ntheir power. As the wife of a Catholic, he had been accustomed to view\nAmine as one who had backslided from the church of Rome--not as one\nwho had been brought up in another creed. He now recalled to mind,\nthat she had never yet been received into the church, for Father\nSeysen had not considered her as in a proper state to be admitted, and\nhad deferred her baptism until he was satisfied of her full belief.\n\n\"You speak boldly; but you speak as you feel, my child,\" replied\nFather Mathias after a pause. \"We will, when we arrive at Goa, talk\nover these things, and with the blessing of God, the new faith shall\nbe made manifest to you.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" replied Amine.\n\nLittle did the priest imagine that Amine's thoughts were at that\nmoment upon a dream she had had at New Guinea, in which her mother\nappeared, and revealed to her her magic arts--and that Amine was\nlonging to arrive at Goa that she might practise them.\n\nEvery hour the gale increased, and the vessel laboured and leaked; the\nPortuguese sailors were frightened, and invoked their saints. Father\nMathias, and the other passengers, gave themselves up for lost, for\nthe pumps could not keep the vessel free; and their cheeks blanched as\nthe waves washed furiously over the vessel: they prayed and trembled.\nFather Mathias gave them absolution; some cried like children, some\ntore their hair, some cursed, and cursed the saints they had but the\nday before invoked. But Amine stood unmoved; and as she heard them\ncurse, she smiled in scorn.\n\n\"My child,\" said Father Mathias, checking his tremulous voice that he\nmight not appear agitated before one whom he saw so calm and unmoved\namidst the roaring of the elements--\"My child, let not this hour of\nperil pass away. Before thou art summoned, let me receive thee into\nthe bosom of our church--give thee pardon for thy sins, and certainty\nof bliss hereafter.\"\n\n\"Good Father, Amine is not to be frightened into belief, even if she\nfeared the storm,\" replied she; \"nor will she credit your power to\nforgive her sins, merely because she says, in fear, that which in her\ncalm reason she might reject. If ever fear could have subjected me,\nit was when I was alone upon the raft--that was indeed a trial of my\nstrength of mind, the bare recollection of which is, at this moment,\nmore dreadful than the storm now raging, and the death which may await\nus. There is a God on high in whose mercy I trust--in whose love I\nconfide--to whose will I bow. Let Him do His will.\"\n\n\"Die not, my child, in unbelief!\"\n\n\"Father,\" replied Amine, pointing to the passengers and seamen who\nwere on the deck crying and wailing: \"these are Christians--these men\nhave been promised by you, but now, the inheritance of perfect bliss.\nWhat is their faith, that it does not give them strength to die like\nmen? Why is it that a woman quails not, while they lie grovelling on\nthe deck?\"\n\n\"Life is sweet, my child--they leave their wives, their children, and\nthey dread hereafter. Who is prepared to die?\"\n\n\"I am,\" replied Amine. \"I have no husband--at least I fear I have no\nhusband. For me life has no sweets; yet, one little hope remains--a\nstraw to the sinking wretch. I fear not death, for I have nought to\nlive for. Were Philip here, why, then indeed--but he is gone before\nme, and now to follow him is all I ask.\"\n\n\"He died in the faith, my child--if you would meet him, do the same.\"\n\n\"He never died like these,\" replied Amine, looking with scorn at the\npassengers.\n\n\"Perhaps he lived not as they have lived,\" replied Father Mathias. \"A\ngood man dies in peace, and hath no fear.\"\n\n\"So die the good men of all creeds, Father,\" replied Amine; \"and in\nall creeds death is equally terrible to the wicked.\"\n\n\"I will pray for thee, my child,\" said Father Mathias, sinking on his\nknees.\n\n\"Many thanks--thy prayers will be heard, even though offered for one\nlike me,\" replied Amine, who, clinging to the man-ropes, made her way\nup to the ladder, and gained the deck.\n\n\"Lost! signora, lost!\" exclaimed the captain, wringing his hands as he\ncrouched under the bulwark.\n\n\"No!\" replied Amine, who had gained the weather side, and held on by a\nrope; \"not lost this time.\"\n\n\"How say you, signora?\" replied the captain, looking with admiration\nat Amine's calm and composed countenance. \"How say you, signora?\"\n\n\"Something tells me, good captain, that you will not be lost, if you\nexert yourselves--something tells it to me here,\" and Amine laid her\nhand to her heart. Amine had a conviction that the vessel would not be\nlost, for it had not escaped her observation that the storm was less\nviolent, although, in their terror, this had been unnoticed by the\nsailors.\n\nThe coolness of Amine, her beauty, perhaps, the unusual sight of a\nwoman so young, calm and confiding, when all others were in despair,\nhad its due effect upon the captain and seamen. Supposing her to be\na Catholic they imagined that she had had some warrant for her\nassertion, for credulity and superstition are close friends. They\nlooked upon Amine with admiration and respect, recovered their\nenergies, and applied to their duties. The pumps were again worked;\nthe storm abated during the night, and the vessel was, as Amine had\npredicted, saved.\n\nThe crew and passengers looked upon her almost as a saint, and talked\nof her to Father Mathias, who was sadly perplexed. The courage which\nshe had displayed was extraordinary; even when he trembled, she showed\nno sign of fear. He made no reply, but communed with his own mind,\nand the result was unfavourable to Amine. What had given her such\ncoolness? what had given her the spirit of prophecy? Not the God of\nthe Christians, for she was no believer. Who then? and Father Mathias\nthought of her chamber at Terneuse, and shook his head.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXX\n\n\nWe must now again return to Philip and Krantz, who had a long\nconversation upon the strange reappearance of Schriften. All that they\ncould agree upon was, that he should be carefully watched, and that\nthey should dispense with his company as soon as possible. Krantz had\ninterrogated him as to his escape, and Schriften had informed him, in\nhis usual sneering manner, that one of the sweeps of the raft had been\nallowed to get adrift during the scuffle, and that he had floated on\nit, until he had gained a small island; that on seeing the peroqua, he\nhad once more launched it and supported himself by it, until he was\nperceived and picked up. As there was nothing impossible although much\nof the improbable in this account, Krantz asked no more questions. The\nnext morning, the wind having abated, they launched the peroqua, and\nmade sail for the island of Ternate.\n\nIt was four days before they arrived: as every night they landed and\nhauled up their craft on the sandy beach. Philip's heart was relieved\nat the knowledge of Amine's safety, and he could have been happy at\nthe prospect of again meeting her, had he not been so constantly\nfretted by the company of Schriften.\n\nThere was something so strange, so contrary to human nature that the\nlittle man, though diabolical as he appeared to be in his disposition,\nshould never hint at, or complain of, Philip's attempts upon his life.\nHad he complained--had he accused Philip of murder--had he vowed\nvengeance and demanded justice on his return to the authorities, it\nhad been different; but no--there he was, making his uncalled-for and\nimpertinent observations, with his eternal chuckle and sarcasm, as if\nhe had not the least cause of anger or ill-will.\n\nAs soon as they arrived at the principal port and town of Ternate,\nthey were conducted to a large cabin, built of palmetto leaves and\nbamboo, and requested not to leave it until their arrival had been\nannounced to the king. The peculiar courtesy and good breeding of\nthese islanders was the constant theme of remark of Philip and Krantz;\ntheir religion, as well as their dress, appeared to be a compound of\nthe Mahometan and Malayan.\n\nAfter a few hours, they were summoned to attend the audience of the\nking, held in the open air. The king was seated under a portico,\nattended by a numerous concourse of priests and soldiers. There was\nmuch company, but little splendour. All who were about the king\nwere robed in white, with white turbans, but he himself was without\nornament. The first thing that struck Philip and Krantz, when they\nwere ushered into the presence of the king, was the beautiful\ncleanliness which everywhere prevailed; every dress was spotless and\nwhite, as the sun could bleach it.\n\nHaving followed the example of those who introduced them, and saluted\nthe king after the Mahommedan custom, they were requested to be\nseated; and through the Portuguese interpreters--for the former\ncommunication of the islanders with the Portuguese, who had been\ndriven from the place, made the Portuguese language well known by\nmany--a few questions were put by the king, who bade them welcome, and\nthen requested to know how they had been wrecked.\n\nPhilip entered into a short detail, in which he stated that his wife\nhad been separated from him, and was, he understood, in the hands of\nthe Portuguese factory at Tidore. He requested to know if his majesty\ncould assist him in obtaining her release, or in going to join her.\n\n\"It is well said,\" replied the king. \"Let refreshments be brought in\nfor the strangers, and the audience be broken up.\"\n\nIn a few minutes there remained of all the Court but two or three\nof the king's confidential friends and advisers; and a collation of\ncurries, fish, and a variety of other dishes was served up. After it\nwas over, the king then said, \"The Portuguese are dogs, they are our\nenemies--will you assist us to fight them? We have large guns, but do\nnot understand the use of them as well as you do. I will send a\nfleet against the Portuguese at Tidore, if you will assist me. Say,\nHollanders, will you fight? You,\" addressing Philip, \"will then\nrecover your wife.\"\n\n\"I will give an answer to you to-morrow,\" replied Philip; \"I must\nconsult with my friend. As I told you before, I was the captain of the\nship, and this was my second in command--we will consult together.\"\nSchriften, whom Philip had represented as a common seaman, had not\nbeen brought up into the presence of the king.\n\n\"It is good,\" replied the king; \"to-morrow we will expect your reply.\"\n\nPhilip and Krantz took their leave, and, on their return to the\ncabin, found that the king had sent them, as a present, two complete\nMahommedan dresses, with turbans. These were welcome, for their own\ngarments were sadly tattered, and very unfit for exposure to the\nburning sun of those climes. Their peaked hats too, collected the rays\nof heat, which were intolerable; and they gladly exchanged them for\nthe white turban. Secreting their money in the Malayan sash, which\nformed a part of the attire, they soon robed themselves in the native\ngarments, the comfort of which was immediately acknowledged. After a\nlong consultation, it was decided that they should accept the terms\noffered by the king, as this was the only feasible way by which\nPhilip could hope to re-obtain possession of Amine. Their consent was\ncommunicated to the king on the following day, and every preparation\nwas made for the expedition.\n\nAnd now was to be beheld a scene of bustle and activity. Hundreds and\nhundreds of peroquas, of every dimension, floating close to the beach,\nside by side, formed a raft extending nearly half a mile on the smooth\nwater of the bay, teeming with men, who were equipping them for the\nservice: some were fitting the sails; others were carpentering\nwhere required; the major portion were sharpening their swords, and\npreparing the deadly poison of the pineapple for their creezes.\nThe beach was a scene of confusion: water in jars, bags of rice,\nvegetables, salt-fish, fowls in coops, were everywhere strewed about\namong the armed natives, who were obeying the orders of the chiefs,\nwho themselves walked up and down, dressed in their gayest apparel,\nand glittering in their arms and ornaments. The king had six long\nbrass four-pounders, a present from an Indian captain; these, with\na proportionate quantity of shot and cartridges, were (under the\ndirection of Philip and Krantz) fitted on some of the largest\nperoquas, and some of the natives were instructed how to use them. At\nfirst the king, who fully expected the reduction of the Portuguese\nfort, stated his determination to go in person; but in this he was\noverruled by his confidential advisers and by the request of Philip,\nwho could not allow him to expose his valuable life. In ten days all\nwas ready, and the fleet, manned by seven thousand men, made sail for\nthe island of Tidore.\n\nIt was a beautiful sight, to behold the blue rippling sea, covered\nwith nearly six hundred of these picturesque craft, all under sail,\nand darting through the water like dolphins in pursuit of prey; all\ncrowded with natives, whose white dresses formed a lively contrast\nwith the deep blue of the water. The large peroquas, in which were\nPhilip and Krantz with the native commanders, were gaily decorated\nwith streamers and pennons of all colours, that flowed out and snapped\nwith the fresh breeze. It appeared rather to be an expedition of\nmirth and merriment, than one which was proceeding to bloodshed and\nslaughter.\n\nOn the evening of the second day they had made the island of Tidore,\nand run down to within a few miles of the Portuguese factory and\nfort. The natives of the country, who disliked, though they feared\nto disobey the Portuguese, had quitted their huts near the beach and\nretired into the woods. The fleet, therefore, anchored and lay near\nthe beach, without molestation, during the night. The next morning\nPhilip and Krantz proceeded to reconnoitre.\n\nThe fort and factory of Tidore were built upon the same principle\nas almost all the Portuguese defences in those seas. An outer\nfortification, consisting of a ditch, with strong palisades embedded\nin masonry, surrounded the factory and all the houses of the\nestablishment. The gates of the outer wall were open all day for\ningress and egress, and closed only at night. On the seaward side\nof this enclosure was what may be termed the citadel or real\nfortification; it was built of solid masonry with parapets, was\nsurrounded by a deep ditch, and was only accessible by a drawbridge,\nmounted with cannon on every side. Its real strength however, could\nnot well be perceived, as it was hidden by the high palisading which\nsurrounded the whole establishment. After a careful survey, Philip\nrecommended that the large peroquas with the cannon should attack by\nsea, while the men of the small vessels should land and surround the\nfort--taking advantage of every shelter which was afforded them, to\ncover themselves while they harassed the enemy with their matchlocks,\narrows, and spears. This plan having been approved of, one hundred and\nfifty peroquas made sail; the others were hauled on the beach, and the\nmen belonging to them proceeded by land.\n\nBut the Portuguese had been warned of their approach, and were fully\nprepared to receive them; the guns mounted to the seaward were of\nheavy calibre and well served. The guns of the peroquas, though\nrendered as effectual as they could be, under the direction of Philip,\nwere small, and did little damage to the thick stone front of the\nfort. After an engagement of four hours, during which the Ternate\npeople lost a great number of men, the peroquas, by the advice of\nPhilip and Krantz, hauled off, and returned to where the remainder of\nthe fleet were stationed; and another council of war was held. The\nforce, which had surrounded the fort on the land side, was, however,\nnot withdrawn, as it cut off any supplies or assistance; and, at the\nsame time, occasionally brought down any of the Portuguese who might\nexpose themselves--a point of no small importance, as Philip well\nknew, with a garrison so small as that in the fort.\n\nThat they could not take the fort by means of their cannon was\nevident; on the sea-side it was for them impregnable; their efforts\nmust now be directed to the land. Krantz, after the native chiefs had\ndone speaking, advised that they should wait until dark, and then\nproceed to the attack in the following way. When the breeze set along\nshore, which it would do in the evening, he proposed that the men\nshould prepare large bundles of dry palmetto and cocoa-nut leaves;\nthat they should carry their bundles and stack them against the\npalisades to windward, and then set fire to them. They would thus burn\ndown the palisades, and gain an entrance into the outer fortification:\nafter which they could ascertain in what manner they should next\nproceed. This advice was too judicious not to be followed. All the men\nwho had not matchlocks were set to collect fagots; a large quantity of\ndry wood was soon got together, and before night they were ready for\nthe second attack.\n\nThe white dresses of the Ternates were laid aside: with nothing\non them but their belts, and scimitars, and creezes, and blue\nunder-drawers, they silently crept up to the palisades, there\ndeposited their fagots, and then again returned, again to perform the\nsame journey. As the breastwork of fagots increased, so did they more\nboldly walk up, until the pile was completed; they then, with a loud\nshout, fired it in several places. The flames mounted, the cannon\nof the fort roared, and many fell under the discharges of grape and\nhand-grenade. But, stifled by the smoke, which poured in volumes upon\nthem, the people in the fort were soon compelled to quit the ramparts\nto avoid suffocation. The palisades were on fire, and the flames\nmounting in the air, swept over, and began to attack the factory and\nhouses. No resistance was now offered, and the Ternates tore down the\nburning palisades, and forced their way into the entrenchment, and\nwith their scimitars and creezes, put to death all who had been so\nunfortunate as not to take refuge in the citadel. These were chiefly\nnative servants, whom the attack had surprised, and for whose lives\nthe Portuguese seemed to care but little, for they paid no attention\nto their cries to lower the drawbridge, and admit them into the fort.\n\nThe factory, built of stone, and all the other houses, were on fire,\nand the island was lighted up for miles. The smoke had cleared away,\nand the defences of the fort were now plainly visible in the broad\nglare of the flames. \"If we had scaling-ladders,\" cried Philip, \"the\nfort would be ours; there is not a soul on the ramparts.\" \"True,\ntrue,\" replied Krantz, \"but even as it is, the factory walls will\nprove an advantageous post for us after the fire is extinguished; if\nwe occupy it we can prevent them showing themselves while the ladders\nare constructing. To-morrow night we may have them ready, and having\nfirst smoked the fort with a few more fagots, we may afterwards mount\nthe walls, and carry the place.\"\n\n\"That will do,\" replied Philip as he walked away. He then joined\nthe native chiefs, who were collected together outside of the\nentrenchment, and communicated to them his plans. When he had made\nknown his views, and the chiefs had assented to them, Schriften, who\nhad come with the expedition unknown to Philip, made his appearance.\n\n\"That won't do; you'll never take that fort, Philip Vanderdecken. He!\nhe!\" cried Schriften.\n\nHardly had he said the words, when a tremendous explosion took place,\nand the air was filled with large stones, which flew and fell in every\ndirection, killing and maiming hundreds. It was the factory which had\nblown up, for in its vaults there was a large quantity of gunpowder,\nto which the fire had communicated.\n\n\"So ends that scheme, Mynheer Vanderdecken. He! he!\" screamed\nSchriften; \"you'll never take that fort.\"\n\nThe loss of life and the confusion caused by this unexpected result,\noccasioned a panic, and all the Ternate people fled down to the beach\nwhere their peroquas were lying.\n\nIt was in vain that Philip and their chiefs attempted to rally them.\nUnaccustomed to the terrible effects of gunpowder in any large\nquantities, they believed that something supernatural had occurred,\nand many of them jumped into the peroquas and made sail, while the\nremainder were confused, trembling, and panting, all huddled together,\non the beach.\n\n\"You'll never take that fort, Mynheer Vanderdecken,\" screamed the\nwell-known voice.\n\nPhilip raised his sword to cleave the little man in two, but he let it\nfall again. \"I fear he tells an unwelcome truth,\" thought Philip; \"but\nwhy should I take his life for that?\"\n\nSome few of the Ternate chiefs still kept up their courage, but\nthe major part were as much alarmed as their people. After some\nconsultation, it was agreed that the army should remain where it was\ntill the next morning, when they should finally decide what to do.\n\nWhen the day dawned, now that the Portuguese fort was no longer\nsurrounded by the other buildings, they perceived that it was more\nformidable than they had at first supposed. The ramparts were filled\nwith men, and they were bringing cannon to bear on the Ternate forces.\nPhilip had a consultation with Krantz, and both acknowledged, that\nwith the present panic nothing more could be done. The chiefs were\nof the same opinion, and orders were given for the return of the\nexpedition: indeed, the Ternate chiefs were fully satisfied with their\nsuccess; they had destroyed the large fort, the factory, and all the\nPortuguese buildings; a small fortification only was uninjured: that\nwas built of stone, and inaccessible, and they knew that the report of\nwhat had been done, would be taken and acknowledged by the king as a\ngreat victory. The order was therefore given for embarkation, and in\ntwo hours the whole fleet, after a loss of about seven hundred men,\nwas again on its way to Ternate. Krantz and Philip this time embarked\nin the same peroqua, that they might have the pleasure of each other's\nconversation. They had not, however, sailed above three hours, when it\nfell calm, and, towards the evening, there was every prospect of bad\nweather. When the breeze again sprung up, it was from an adverse\nquarter, but these vessels steer so close to the wind, that this was\ndisregarded: by midnight, however, the wind had increased to a gale,\nand before they were clear of the N.E. headland of Tidore, it blew a\nhurricane, and many were washed off into the sea from the different\ncraft, and those who could not swim, sank, and were drowned. The sails\nwere lowered, and the vessels lay at the mercy of the wind and waves,\nevery sea washing over them. The fleet was drifting fast on the shore,\nand before morning dawned, the vessel in which were Philip and Krantz\nwas among the rollers on the beach off the northern end of the island.\nIn a short time she was dashed to pieces, and every one had to look\nout for himself. Philip and Krantz laid hold of one fragment, and were\nsupported by it till they gained the shore; here they found about\nthirty more companions who had suffered the same fate as themselves.\nWhen the day dawned, they perceived that the major part of the fleet\nhad weathered the point, and that those who had not, would in all\nprobability escape, as the wind had moderated.\n\nThe Ternate people proposed, that as they were well armed, they\nshould, as soon as the weather moderated, launch some of the craft\nbelonging to the islanders, and join the fleet; but Philip, who had\nbeen consulting with Krantz, considered this a good opportunity for\nascertaining the fate of Amine. As the Portuguese could prove nothing\nagainst them, they could either deny that they had been among the\nassailants, or might plead that they had been forced to join them. At\nall risks, Philip was determined to remain, and Krantz agreed to share\nhis fate: and seeming to agree with them, they allowed the Ternate\npeople to walk to the Tidore peroquas, and while they were launching\nthem Philip and Krantz fell back into the jungle and disappeared. The\nPortuguese had perceived the wreck of their enemies, and, irritated by\nthe loss they had sustained, they had ordered the people of the island\nto go out and capture all who were driven on shore. Now that they were\nno longer assailed, the Tidore people obeyed them, and very soon fell\nin with Philip and Krantz, who had quietly sat down under the shade of\na large tree, waiting the issue. They were led away to the fort, where\nthey arrived by nightfall. They were ushered into the presence of the\nCommandant, the same little man who had made love to Amine, and as\nthey were dressed in Mussulman's attire, he was about to order them to\nbe hung, when Philip told him that they were Dutchmen, who had been\nwrecked, and forced by the King of Ternate to join his expedition;\nthat they had taken the earliest opportunity of escaping, as was very\nevident since those who had been thrown on shore with them had got off\nin the island boats, while they chose to remain. Whereupon the little\nPortuguese Commandant struck his sword firm down on the pavement of\nthe ramparts, _looked_ very big, and then ordered them to prison for\nfurther examination.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXI\n\n\nAs every one descants upon the want of comfort in a prison, it is to\nbe presumed that there are no very comfortable ones. Certainly that to\nwhich Philip and Krantz were ushered, had anything rather than the air\nof an agreeable residence. It was under the fort, with a very small\naperture looking towards the sea, for light and air. It was very hot,\nand moreover destitute of all those little conveniences which add\nso much to one's happiness in modern houses and hotels. In fact, it\nconsisted of four bare walls, and a stone floor, and that was all.\n\nPhilip, who wished to make some inquiries relative to Amine,\naddressed, in Portuguese, the soldier who brought them down.\n\n\"My good friend, I beg your pardon--\"\n\n\"I beg yours,\" replied the soldier going out of the door, and locking\nthem in.\n\nPhilip leant gloomily against the wall; Krantz, more mercurial, walked\nup and down three steps each way and turn.\n\n\"Do you know what I am thinking of?\" observed Krantz, after a pause in\nhis walk. \"It is very fortunate that (lowering his voice) we have all\nour doubloons about us; if they don't search us, we may yet get away\nby bribing.\"\n\n\"And I was thinking,\" rejoined Philip, \"that I would sooner be here\nthan in company with that wretch Schriften, whose sight is poison to\nme.\"\n\n\"I did not much admire the appearance of the Commandant, but I suppose\nwe shall know more to-morrow.\"\n\nHere they were interrupted by the turning of the key, and the entrance\nof a soldier with a chatty of water, and a large dish of boiled rice.\nHe was not the man who had brought them to the dungeon, and Philip\naccosted him.\n\n\"You have had hard work within these last two days?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed! signor.\"\n\n\"The natives forced us to join the expedition, and we escaped.\"\n\n\"So I heard you say, signor.\"\n\n\"They lost nearly a thousand men,\" said Krantz.\n\n\"Holy St Francis! I am glad of it.\"\n\n\"They will be careful how they attack Portuguese in a hurry, I\nexpect,\" rejoined Krantz.\n\n\"I think so,\" replied the soldier.\n\n\"Did you lose many men?\" ventured Philip, perceiving that the man was\nloquacious.\n\n\"Not ten of our own people. In the factory there were about a hundred\nof the natives, with some women and children; but that is of no\nconsequence.\"\n\n\"You had a young European woman here, I understand,\" said Philip with\nanxiety; \"one who was wrecked in a vessel--was she among those who\nwere lost?\"\n\n\"Young woman!--Holy St Francis. Yes, now I recollect. Why the fact\nis--\"\n\n\"Pedro!\" called a voice from above; the man stopped, put his fingers\nto his lips, went out, and locked the door.\n\n\"God of Heaven! give me patience,\" cried Philip; \"but this is too\ntrying.\"\n\n\"He will be down here again to-morrow morning,\" observed Krantz.\n\n\"Yes! to-morrow morning; but what an endless time will suspense make\nof the intervening hours.\"\n\n\"I feel for you,\" replied Krantz; \"but what can be done? The hours\nmust pass, though suspense draws them out into interminable years; but\nI hear footsteps.\"\n\nAgain the door was unlocked, and the first soldier made his\nappearance. \"Follow me--the Commandant would speak with you.\"\n\nThis unexpected summons was cheerfully complied with by Philip and his\ncompanion. They walked up the narrow stone steps, and at last found\nthemselves in a small room, in presence of the Commandant, with whom\nour readers have been already made acquainted. He was lolling on a\nsmall sofa, his long sword lay on the table before him, and two young\nnative women were fanning him, one at his head, and the other at his\nfeet.\n\n\"Where did you get those dresses?\" was the first interrogatory.\n\n\"The natives, when they brought us prisoners from the island on which\nwe had saved ourselves, took away our clothes, and gave us these as a\npresent from their king.\"\n\n\"And engaged you to serve in their fleet, in the attack on this fort?\"\n\n\"They forced us,\" replied Krantz; \"for as there was no war between our\nnations, we objected to this service: notwithstanding which, they put\nus on board, to make the common people believe that they were assisted\nby Europeans.\"\n\n\"How am I to know the truth of this?\"\n\n\"You have our word in the first place, and our escape from them in the\nsecond.\"\n\n\"You belonged to a Dutch East-Indiaman. Are you officers or common\nseamen?\"\n\nKrantz, who considered that they were less likely to be detained if\nthey concealed their rank on board, gave Philip a slight touch with\nhis finger as he replied, \"We are inferior officers. I was third mate,\nand this man was pilot.\"\n\n\"And your captain, where is he?\"\n\n\"I--I cannot say, whether he is alive or dead.\"\n\n\"Had you no woman on board?\"\n\n\"Yes! the captain had his wife.\"\n\n\"What has become of her?\"\n\n\"She is supposed to have perished on a portion of the raft which broke\nadrift.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" replied the Commandant, who remained silent for some time.\n\nPhilip looked at Krantz, as much as to say, \"Why all this subterfuge;\"\nbut Krantz gave him a sign to leave him to speak.\n\n\"You say you don't know whether your captain is alive or dead?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Now, suppose I was to give you your liberty, would you have any\nobjection to sign a paper, stating his death, and swearing to the\ntruth of it?\"\n\nPhilip stared at the Commandant, and then at Krantz.\n\n\"I see no objection, exactly; except that if it were sent home to\nHolland we might get into trouble. May I ask, signor Commandant, why\nyou wish for such a paper?\"\n\n\"No!\" roared the little man, in a voice like thunder. \"I will give\nno reason, but that I wish it; that is enough; take your choice--the\ndungeon, or liberty and a passage by the first vessel which calls.\"\n\n\"I don't doubt--in fact--I'm sure, he must be dead by this time,\"\nreplied Krantz, drawing out the words in a musing manner. \"Commandant,\nwill you give us till to-morrow morning to make our calculations?\"\n\n\"Yes! you may go.\"\n\n\"But not to the dungeon, Commandant,\" replied Krantz; \"we are not\nprisoners, certainly; and, if you wish us to do you a favour, surely\nyou will not ill-treat us?\"\n\n\"By your own acknowledgment you have taken up arms against the\nmost Christian King; however, you may remain at liberty for the\nnight--to-morrow morning will decide whether or no you are prisoners.\"\n\nPhilip and Krantz thanked the little Commandant for his kindness, and\nthen hastened away to the ramparts. It was now dark, and the moon had\nnot yet made her appearance. They sat there on the parapet, enjoying\nthe breeze, and feeling the delight of liberty, even after their short\nincarceration; but, near to them, soldiers were either standing or\nlying, and they spoke but in whispers.\n\n\"What could he mean by requiring us to give a certificate of the\ncaptain's death; and why did you answer as you did?\"\n\n\"Philip Vanderdecken, that I have often thought of the fate of your\nbeautiful wife, you may imagine; and, when I heard that she was\nbrought here, I then trembled for her. What must she appear, lovely as\nshe is, when placed in comparison with the women of this country? And\nthat little Commandant--is he not the very person who would be taken\nwith her charms? I denied our condition, because I thought he would\nbe more likely to allow us our liberty as humble individuals, than as\ncaptain and first mate; particularly as he suspects that we led on the\nTernate people to the attack; and when he asked for a certificate\nof your death, I immediately imagined that he wanted it in order to\ninduce Amine to marry him. But where is she? is the question. If we\ncould only find out that soldier, we might gain some information.\"\n\n\"Depend upon it, she is here,\" replied Philip, clenching his hands.\n\n\"I am inclined to think so,\" said Krantz; \"that she is alive, I feel\nassured.\"\n\nThe conversation was continued until the moon rose, and threw her\nbeams over the tumbling waters. Philip and Krantz turned their faces\ntowards the sea, and leant over the battlements in silence; after some\ntime their reveries were disturbed by a person coming up to them with\na \"_Buenos noctes, signor_.\"\n\nKrantz immediately recognised the Portuguese soldier, whose\nconversation with him had been interrupted.\n\n\"Good-night, my friend! We thank Heaven that you have no longer to\nturn the key upon us.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm surprised!\" replied the soldier, in a low tone. \"Our\nCommandant is fond of exercising his power; he rules here without\nappeal, that I can tell you.\"\n\n\"He is not within hearing of us now,\" replied Krantz. \"It is a lovely\nspot this to live in! How long have you been in this country?\"\n\n\"Now, thirteen years, signor, and I'm tired of it. I have a wife and\nchildren in Oporto--that is, I _had_--but whether they are alive or\nnot, who can tell?\"\n\n\"Do you not expect to return and see them?\"\n\n\"Return--signor! no Portuguese soldier like me ever returns. We are\nenlisted for five years, and we lay our bones here.\"\n\n\"That is hard indeed.\"\n\n\"Hard, signor,\" replied the soldier in a low whisper; \"it is cruel\nand treacherous. I have often thought of putting the muzzle of my\narquebuse to my head; but while there's life there's hope.\"\n\n\"I pity you, my good fellow,\" rejoined Krantz; \"look you, I have two\ngold pieces left--take one; you may be able to send it home to your\npoor wife.\"\n\n\"And here is one of mine, too, my good fellow,\" added Philip, putting\nanother in his hand.\n\n\"Now may all the saints preserve you, signors,\" replied the soldier,\n\"for it is the first act of kindness shown to me for many years--not\nthat my wife and children have much chance of ever receiving it.\"\n\n\"You were speaking about a young European woman when we were in the\ndungeon,\" observed Krantz, after a pause.\n\n\"Yes, signor, she was a very beautiful creature. Our Commandant was\nvery much in love with her.\"\n\n\"Where is she now?\"\n\n\"She went away to Goa, in company with a priest who knew, her, Father\nMathias, a good old man; he gave me absolution when he was here.\"\n\n\"Father Mathias!\" exclaimed Philip; but a touch from Krantz checked\nhim.\n\n\"You say the Commandant loved her?\"\n\n\"O yes; the little man was quite mad about her; and had it not been\nfor the arrival of Father Mathias, he would never have let her go,\nthat I'm sure of, although she was another man's wife.\"\n\n\"Sailed for Goa, you said?\"\n\n\"Yes, in a ship which called here. She must have been very glad to\nhave got away, for our little Commandant persecuted her all day long,\nand she evidently was grieving for her husband. Do you know, signors,\nif her husband is alive?\"\n\n\"No, we do not; we have heard nothing of him.\"\n\n\"Well, if he is, I hope he will not come here; for should the\nCommandant have him in his power, it would go hard with him. He is a\nman who sticks at nothing. He is a brave little fellow, _that_ cannot\nbe denied; but to get possession of that lady, he would remove all\nobstacles at any risk--and a husband is a very serious one, signors.\nWell, signors,\" continued the soldier, after a pause, \"I had better\nnot be seen here too long; you may command me if you want anything;\nrecollect, my name is Pedro--good-night to you, and a thousand\nthanks,\" and the soldier walked away.\n\n\"We have made one friend, at all events,\" said Krantz, \"and we have\ngained information of no little importance.\"\n\n\"Most important,\" replied Philip. \"Amine then has sailed for Goa with\nFather Mathias! I feel that she is safe, and in good hands. He is an\nexcellent man, that Father Mathias--my mind is much relieved.\"\n\n\"Yes; but recollect you are in the power of your enemy. We must leave\nthis place as quick as we can--to-morrow we must sign the paper. It\nis of little consequence, as we shall probably be at Goa before it\narrives, and even if we are not, the news of your death would not\noccasion Amine to marry this little withered piece of mortality.\"\n\n\"That I feel assured of; but it may cause her great suffering.\"\n\n\"Not worse than her present suspense, believe me, Philip; but it\nis useless canvassing the past--it must be done. I shall sign as\nCornelius Richter, our third mate; you, as Jacob Vantreat--recollect\nthat.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" replied Philip, who then turned away, as if willing to be\nleft to his own thoughts. Krantz perceived it, and laid down under the\nembrasure, and was soon fast asleep.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXII\n\n\nTired out with the fatigue of the day before, Philip had laid himself\ndown by Krantz and fallen asleep; early the next morning he was\nawakened by the sound of the Commandant's voice, and his long sword\nrattling as usual upon the pavement. He rose, and found the little man\nrating the soldiers--threatening some with the dungeon, others with\nextra duty. Krantz was also on his feet before the Commandant had\nfinished his morning's lecture. At last, perceiving them, in a stern\nvoice he ordered them to follow him into his apartment. They did so,\nand the Commandant throwing himself upon his sofa, inquired whether\nthey were ready to sign the required paper, or go back to the\ndungeon.--Krantz replied that they had been calculating chances, and\nthat they were in consequence so perfectly convinced of the death of\nthe captain, that they were willing to sign any paper to that effect;\nat which reply, the Commandant immediately became very gracious, and\nhaving called for materials, he wrote out the document, which was duly\nsubscribed to by Krantz and Philip. As soon as they had signed it, and\nhe had it in his possession, the little man was so pleased, that he\nrequested them to partake of his breakfast.\n\nDuring the repast, he promised that they should leave the island by\nthe first opportunity. Although Philip was taciturn, yet as Krantz\nmade himself very agreeable, the Commandant invited them to dinner.\nKrantz, as they became more familiar, informed him that they had each\na few pieces of gold, and wished to be allowed a room where they could\nkeep their table. Whether it was the want of society or the desire of\nobtaining the gold, probably both, the Commandant offered that they\nshould join his table and pay their proportion of the expenses; a\nproposal which was gladly acceded to. The terms were arranged, and\nKrantz insisted upon putting down the first week's payment in advance.\nFrom that moment the Commandant was the best of friends with them,\nand did nothing but caress them whom he had so politely shoved into a\ndungeon below water. It was on the evening of the third day, as they\nwere smoking their Manilla cheroots, that Krantz, perceiving the\nCommandant in a peculiarly good humour, ventured to ask him why he was\nso anxious for a certificate of the captain's death; and in reply was\ninformed, much to the astonishment of Philip, that Amine had agreed to\nmarry him upon his producing such a document.\n\n\"Impossible,\" cried Philip, starting from his seat.\n\n\"Impossible, signor, and why impossible?\" replied the Commandant\ncurling his mustachios with his fingers, with a surprised and angry\nair.\n\n\"I should have said impossible too,\" interrupted Krantz, who perceived\nthe consequences of Philip's indiscretion, \"for had you seen,\nCommandant, how that woman doted upon her husband, how she fondled\nhim, you would with us have said, it was impossible that she could\nhave transferred her affections so soon; but women are women, and\nsoldiers have a great advantage over other people; perhaps she has\nsome excuse, Commandant.--Here's your health, and success to you.\"\n\n\"It is exactly what I would have said,\" added Philip, acting upon\nKrantz's plan: \"but she has a great excuse, Commandant, when I\nrecollect her husband, and have you in my presence.\"\n\nSoothed with the flattery, the Commandant replied, \"Why, yes, they say\nmilitary men are very successful with the fair sex.--I presume it\nis because they look up to us for protection, and where can they\nbe better assured of it, than with a man who wears a sword at his\nthigh.--Come, signors, we will drink her health. Here's to the\nbeautiful Amine Vanderdecken.\"\n\n\"To the beautiful Amine Vanderdecken,\" cried Krantz, tossing off his\nwine.\n\n\"To the beautiful Amine Vanderdecken,\" followed Philip. \"But,\nCommandant, are you not afraid to trust her at Goa, where there are\nso many enticements for a woman, so many allurements held out for her\nsex?\"\n\n\"No, not in the least--I am convinced that she loves me--nay, between\nourselves, that she doats upon me.\"\n\n\"Liar!\" exclaimed Philip.\n\n\"How, signor! is that addressed to me?\" cried the Commandant, seizing\nhis sword which lay on the table.\n\n\"No, no,\" replied Philip, recovering himself; \"it was addressed to\nher; I have heard her swear to her husband, that she would exist for\nno other but him.\"\n\n\"Ha! ha! Is that all?\" replied the Commandant, \"my friend, you do not\nknow women.\"\n\n\"No, nor is he very partial to them either,\" replied Krantz, who then\nleant over to the Commandant and whispered, \"He is always so when you\ntalk of women. He was cruelly jilted once, and hates the whole sex.\"\n\n\"Then we must be merciful to him,\" replied the little officer:\n\"suppose we change the subject.\"\n\nWhen they repaired to their own room, Krantz pointed out to Philip the\nnecessity for his commanding his feelings, as otherwise they would\nagain be immured in the dungeon. Philip acknowledged his rashness, but\npointed out to Krantz, that the circumstance of Amine having promised\nto marry the Commandant, if he procured certain intelligence of his\ndeath, was the cause of his irritation. \"Can it be so? Is it possible\nthat she can have been so false,\" exclaimed Philip; \"yet his anxiety\nto procure that document seems to warrant the truth of his assertion.\"\n\n\"I think, Philip, that in all probability it is true,\" replied Krantz,\ncarelessly; \"but of this you may be assured that she has been placed\nin a situation of great peril, and has only done so to save herself\nfor your sake. When you meet, depend upon it she will fully prove to\nyou that necessity had compelled her to deceive him in that way, and\nthat if she had not done so, she would, by this time, have fallen a\nprey to his violence.\"\n\n\"It may be so,\" replied Philip, gravely.\n\n\"It is so, Philip, my life upon it. Do not for a moment harbour a\nthought so injurious to one who lives but in your love. Suspect that\nfond and devoted creature! I blush for you, Philip Vanderdecken.\"\n\n\"You are right, and I beg her pardon for allowing such feelings or\nthoughts to have for one moment overpowered me,\" responded Philip;\n\"but it is a hard case for a husband, who loves as I do, to hear\nhis wife's name bandied about, and her character assailed by a\ncontemptible wretch like this Commandant.\"\n\n\"It is, I grant; but still I prefer even that to a dungeon,\" replied\nKrantz, \"and so, good-night.\"\n\nFor three weeks they remained in the fort, every day becoming more\nintimate with the Commandant, who often communicated with Krantz, when\nPhilip was not present, turning the conversation upon his love for\nAmine, and entering into a minute detail of all that had passed.\nKrantz perceived that he was right in his opinion, and that Amine had\nonly been cajoling the Commandant, that she might escape. But the time\npassed heavily away with Philip and Krantz, for no vessel made its\nappearance.\n\n\"When shall I see her again?\" soliloquised Philip one morning as he\nlolled over the parapet, in company with Krantz.\n\n\"See! who?\" said the Commandant, who happened to be at his elbow.\n\nPhilip turned round, and stammered something unintelligible.\n\n\"We were talking of his sister, Commandant,\" said Krantz, taking his\narm, and leading him away.--\"Do not mention the subject to my friend,\nfor it is a very painful one, and forms one reason why he is so\ninimical to the sex. She was married to his intimate friend, and ran\naway from her husband: it was his only sister; and the disgrace broke\nhis mother's heart, and has made him miserable. Take no notice of it,\nI beg.\"\n\n\"No, no, certainly not; I don't wonder at it: the honour of one's\nfamily is a serious affair,\" replied the Commandant.--\"Poor young man,\nwhat with his sister's conduct, and the falsehood of his own intended,\nI don't wonder at his being so grave and silent. Is he of good family,\nsignor?\"\n\n\"One of the noblest in all Holland,\" replied Krantz;--\"he is heir to\na large property, and independent by the fortune of his mother; but\nthese two unfortunate events induced him to quit the States secretly,\nand he embarked for these countries that he might forget his grief.\"\n\n\"One of the noblest families?\" replied the Commandant;--\"then he\nis under an assumed name--Jacob Vantreat is not his true name, of\ncourse.\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" replied Krantz;--\"that it is not, I assure you; but my lips\nare sealed on that point.\"\n\n\"Of course, except to a friend, who can keep a secret. I will not ask\nit now. So he is really noble?\"\n\n\"One of the highest families in the country, possessing great wealth\nand influence--allied to the Spanish nobility by marriage.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" rejoined the Commandant, musing--\"I dare say he knows many\nof the Portuguese as well.\"\n\n\"No doubt of it, they are all more or less connected.\"\n\n\"He must prove to you a most valuable friend, Signor Richter.\"\n\n\"I consider myself provided for for life as soon as we return home. He\nis of a very grateful, generous disposition, as he would prove to you,\nshould you ever fall in with him again.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt of it; and I can assure you that I am heartily tired\nof staying in this country. Here I shall remain probably for two years\nmore before I am relieved, and then shall have to join my regiment at\nGoa, and not be able to obtain leave to return home without resigning\nmy commission. But he is coming this way.\"\n\nAfter this conversation with Krantz, the alteration in the manner of\nthe Portuguese Commandant, who had the highest respect for nobility,\nwas most marked. He treated Philip with a respect, which was\nobservable to all in the fort; and which was, until Krantz had\nexplained the cause, a source of astonishment to Philip himself. The\nCommandant often introduced the subject to Krantz, and sounded him as\nto whether his conduct towards Philip had been such, as to have made\na favourable impression; for the little man now hoped, that, through\nsuch an influential channel, he might reap some benefit.\n\nSome days after this conversation, as they were all three seated at\ntable, a corporal entered, and saluting the Commandant, informed\nhim that a Dutch sailor had arrived at the fort, and wished to know\nwhether he should be admitted. Both Philip and Krantz turned pale at\nthis communication--they had a presentiment of evil, but they said\nnothing. The sailor was ordered in, and in a few minutes, who should\nmake his appearance but their tormentor, the one-eyed Schriften.\nOn perceiving Philip and Krantz seated at the table he immediately\nexclaimed, \"Oh! Captain Philip Vanderdecken, and my good friend\nMynheer Krantz, first mate of the good ship _Utrecht_, I am glad to\nmeet you again.\"\n\n\"Captain Philip Vanderdecken!\" roared the Commandant, as he sprung\nfrom his chair.\n\n\"Yes, that is my Captain, Mynheer Philip Vanderdecken; and that is my\nfirst mate, Mynheer Krantz; both of the good ship _Utrecht_: we were\nwrecked together, were we not, Mynheer? He! he!\"\n\n\"Sangue de--Vanderdecken! the husband? Corpo del Diavolo--is it\npossible?\" cried the Commandant, panting for breath, as he seized his\nlong sword with both hands, and clenched it with fury--\"What then, I\nhave been deceived, cajoled, laughed at!\" Then, after a pause--the\nveins of his forehead distending so as almost to burst--he continued,\nwith a suppressed voice, \"Most noble sir, I thank you; but now it is\nmy turn.--What, ho! there! Corporal--men, here instantly--quick!\"\n\nPhilip and Krantz felt convinced that all denial was useless. Philip\nfolded his arms and made no reply. Krantz merely observed, \"A little\nreflection will prove to you, sir, that this indignation is not\nwarranted.\"\n\n\"Not warranted!\" rejoined the Commandant with a sneer; \"you have\ndeceived me; but you are caught in your own trap. I have the paper\nsigned, which I shall not fail to make use of. _You_ are dead, you\nknow, captain; I have your own hand to it, and your wife will be glad\nto believe it.\"\n\n\"She has deceived you, Commandant, to get out of your power, nothing\nmore,\" said Vanderdecken. \"She would spurn a contemptible withered\nwretch like yourself, were she as free as the wind.\"\n\n\"Go on, go on; it will be my turn soon. Corporal, throw these two men\ninto the dungeon: a sentry at the door till further orders. Away with\nthem. Most noble sir, perhaps your influential friends in Holland and\nSpain will enable you to get out again.\"\n\nPhilip and Krantz were led away by the soldiers, who were very much\nsurprised at this change of treatment. Schriften followed them; and\nas they walked across the rampart to the stairs which led to their\nprison, Krantz, in his fury, burst from the soldiers, and bestowed a\nkick upon Schriften which sent him several feet forward on his face.\n\n\"That was a good one--he! he!\" cried Schriften, smiling and looking at\nKrantz as he regained his legs.\n\nThere was an eye, however, which met theirs with an intelligent\nglance, as they descended the stairs to the dungeon. It was that of\nthe soldier Pedro. It told them that there was one friend upon whom\nthey could rely, and who would spare no endeavour to assist them in\ntheir new difficulty. It was a consolation to them both; a ray of hope\nwhich cheered them as they once more descended the narrow steps, and\nheard the heavy key turned which again secured them in their dungeon.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXIII\n\n\n\"Thus are all our hopes wrecked,\" said Philip, mournfully; \"what\nchance have we now of escaping from this little tyrant?\"\n\n\"Chances turn up,\" replied Krantz; \"at present, the prospect is not\nvery cheering. Let us hope for the best.\"\n\n\"I have an idea in my head which may probably be turned to some\naccount,\" added Krantz; \"as soon as the little man's fury is over.\"\n\n\"Which is--\"\n\n\"That, much as he likes your wife, there is something which he likes\nquite as well--money. Now, as we know where all the treasure is\nconcealed, I think he may be tempted to offer us our liberty, if we\nwere to promise to put it into his possession.\"\n\n\"That is not impossible. Confound that little malignant wretch\nSchriften; he certainly is not, as you say, of this world. He has been\nmy persecutor through life, and appears to act from an impulse not his\nown.\"\n\n\"Then must he be part and portion of your destiny. I'm thinking\nwhether our noble Commandant intends to leave us without anything to\neat or drink.\"\n\n\"I should not be surprised: that he will attempt my life I am\nconvinced of, but not that he can take it; he may, however, add to its\nsufferings.\"\n\nAs soon as the Commandant had recovered from his fury, he ordered\nSchriften in, to be examined more particularly; but after every search\nmade for him, Schriften was no where to be found. The sentry at the\ngate declared that he had not passed; and a new search was ordered,\nbut in vain. Even the dungeons and galleries below were examined, but\nwithout success.\n\n\"Can he be locked up with the other prisoners?\" thought the\nCommandant: \"impossible--but I will go and see.\"\n\nHe descended and opened the door of the dungeon, looked in, and was\nabout to return without speaking, when Krantz said, \"Well, signor,\nthis is kind treatment, after having lived so long and so amicably\ntogether; to throw us into prison merely because a fellow declares\nthat we are not what we represented ourselves to be; perhaps you will\nallow us a little water to drink?\"\n\nThe Commandant, confused by the extraordinary disappearance of\nSchriften, hardly knew how to reply. He at last said in a milder tone\nthan was to be anticipated, \"I will order them to bring some, signor.\"\n\nHe then closed the door of the dungeon and disappeared.\n\n\"Strange,\" observed Philip, \"he appears more pacified already.\"\n\nIn a few minutes the door was again opened, and Pedro came in with a\nchatty of water.\n\n\"He has disappeared like magic, signors, and is no where to be found.\nWe have searched everywhere, but in vain.\"\n\n\"Who?--the little old seaman?\"\n\n\"Yes, he whom you kicked as you were led to prison. The people all\nsay, that it must have been a ghost. The sentry declares that he never\nleft the fort, nor came near him; so, how he has got away is a riddle,\nwhich I perceive, has frightened our Commandant not a little.\"\n\nKrantz gave a long whistle as he looked at Philip.\n\n\"Are you to have charge of us, Pedro?\"\n\n\"I hope so.\"\n\n\"Well, tell the Commandant that when he is ready to listen to me, I\nhave something of importance to communicate.\"\n\nPedro went out.\n\n\"Now, Philip, I can frighten this little man into allowing us to go\nfree, if you will consent to say that you are not the husband of\nAmine.\"\n\n\"That I cannot do, Krantz. I will not utter such a falsehood.\"\n\n\"I was afraid so, and yet it appears to me that we may avail ourselves\nof duplicity to meet cruelty and injustice. Unless you do as I\npropose, I hardly know how I can manage it; however, I will try what I\ncan do.\"\n\n\"I will assist you in every way, except disclaiming my wife: that I\nnever will do.\"\n\n\"Well then, I will see if I can make up a story that will suit all\nparties: let me think.\"\n\nKrantz continued musing as he walked up and down, and was still\noccupied with his own thoughts when the door opened, and the\nCommandant made his appearance.\n\n\"You have something to impart to me, I understand--what is it?\"\n\n\"First, sir, bring that little wretch down here and confront him with\nus.\"\n\n\"I see no occasion for that,\" replied the Commandant; \"what, sir, may\nyou have to say?\"\n\n\"Do you know who you have in your company when you speak to that\none-eyed deformity?\"\n\n\"A Dutch sailor, I presume.\"\n\n\"No--a spirit--a demon--who occasioned the loss of the vessel; and who\nbrings misfortune wherever he appears.\"\n\n\"Holy Virgin! What do you tell me, signor?\"\n\n\"The fact, signor Commandant. We are obliged to you for confining us\nhere, while he is in the fort; but beware for yourself.\"\n\n\"You are laughing at me.\"\n\n\"I am not; bring him down here. This noble gentleman has power over\nhim. I wonder, indeed, at his daring to stay while he is so near; he\nhas on his heart that which will send him trembling away.--Bring\nhim down here, and you shall at once see him vanish with curses and\nscreams.\"\n\n\"Heaven defend us!\" cried the Commandant, terrified.\n\n\"Send for him now, signor?\"\n\n\"He is gone--vanished--not to be found!\"\n\n\"I thought as much,\" replied Philip, significantly.\n\n\"He is gone--vanished--you say. Then, Commandant, you will probably\napologise to this noble gentleman for your treatment of him, and\npermit us to return to our former apartments. I will there explain to\nyou this most strange and interesting history.\"\n\nThe Commandant, more confused than ever, hardly knew how to act. At\nlast he bowed to Philip, and begged that he would consider himself at\nliberty; and, continued he to Krantz, \"I shall be most happy at an\nimmediate explanation of this affair, for everything appears so\ncontradictory.\"\n\n\"And must, until it is explained. I will follow you into your own\nroom; a courtesy you must not expect from my noble friend, who is not\na little indignant at your treatment of him.\"\n\nThe Commandant went out, leaving the door open. Philip and Krantz\nfollowed: the former retiring to his own apartment; the latter,\nbending his steps after the Commandant to his sitting-room. The\nconfusion which whirled in the brain of the Commandant, made him\nappear most ridiculous. He hardly knew whether to be imperative or\ncivil; whether he was really speaking to the first mate of the vessel,\nor to another party; or whether he had insulted a noble, or been\ncajoled by a captain of a vessel: he threw himself down on his sofa,\nand Krantz, taking his seat in a chair, stated as follows:\n\n\"You have been partly deceived and partly not, Commandant. When we\nfirst came here, not knowing what treatment we might receive, we\nconcealed our rank; afterwards I made known to you the rank of my\nfriend on shore; but did not think it worth while to say anything\nabout his situation on board of the vessel. The fact is, as you may\nwell suppose of a person of his dignity, he was owner of the fine ship\nwhich was lost through the intervention of that one-eyed wretch; but\nof that by-and-bye. Now for the story.\n\n\"About ten years ago there was a great miser in Amsterdam; he lived\nin the most miserable way that a man could live in; wore nothing but\nrags; and having been formerly a seaman, his attire was generally of\nthe description common to his class. He had one son, to whom he denied\nthe necessaries of life, and whom he treated most cruelly. After\nvain attempts to possess a portion of his father's wealth, the devil\ninstigated the son to murder the old man, who was one day found dead\nin his bed; but as there were no marks of violence which could be\nsworn to, although suspicion fell upon the son, the affair was hushed\nup, and the young man took possession of his father's wealth. It was\nfully expected that there would now be rioting and squandering on the\npart of the heir, as is usually the case; but, on the contrary, he\nnever spent anything, but appeared to be as poor--even poorer--than he\never was. Instead of being gay and merry, he was, in appearance, the\nmost miserable, downcast person in the world; and he wandered about,\nseeking a crust of bread wherever he could find it. Some said that he\nhad been inoculated by his father, and was as great a miser as his\nfather had been; others shook their heads, and said that all was not\nright. At last, after pining away for six or seven years, the young\nman died at an early age, without confession or absolution; in fact,\nhe was found dead in his bed. Beside the bed there was a paper,\naddressed to the authorities, in which he acknowledged that he had\nmurdered his father for the sake of his wealth; and that when he went\nto take some of it for his expenses on the day afterwards, he found\nhis father's spirit sitting on the bags of money, and menacing him\nwith instant death, if he touched one piece. He returned again and\nagain, and found his father a sentinel as before. At last, he gave\nup attempting to obtain it; his crime made him miserable, and he\ncontinued in possession, without daring to expend one sixpence of all\nthe money. He requested that, as his end was approaching, the money\nshould be given to the church of his patron saint, wherever that\nchurch might be found; if there was not one, then that a church might\nbe built and endowed. Upon investigation, it appeared that there was\nno such church in either Holland or the Low Countries (for you know\nthat there are not many Catholics there); and they applied to the\nCatholic countries, Lisbon and Spain, but there again they were at\nfault; and it was discovered, that the only church dedicated to that\nsaint was one which had been erected by a Portuguese nobleman in the\ncity of Goa, in the East Indies. The Catholic bishop determined that\nthe money should be sent to Goa; and, in consequence, it was embarked\non board of my patron's vessel, to be delivered up to the first\nPortuguese authorities he might fall in with.\n\n\"Well, signor, the money, for better security, was put down into the\ncaptain's cabin, which, of course, was occupied by my noble friend,\nand when he went to bed the first night he was surprised to perceive a\nlittle one eyed old man sitting on the boxes.\"\n\n\"Merciful Saviour!\" exclaimed the Commandant, \"what, the very same\nlittle man who appeared here this day?\"\n\n\"The very same,\" replied Krantz.\n\nThe Commandant crossed himself, and Krantz proceeded:--\"My noble\npatron was, as you may imagine, rather alarmed; but he is very\ncourageous in disposition, and he inquired of the old man who he was,\nand how he had come on board?\n\n\"'I came on board with my own money,' replied the spectre. It is all\nmy own, and I shall keep it. The church shall never have one stiva of\nit if I can help it.'\n\n\"Whereupon, my patron pulled out a famous relic, which he wears on\nhis bosom, and held it towards him; at which the old man howled and\nscreamed, and then most unwillingly disappeared. For two more\nnights the spectre was obstinate, but at the sight of the relic, he\ninvariably went off howling as if in great pain; every time that\nhe went away, invariably crying out 'Lost--lost!' and during the\nremainder of the voyage he did not trouble us any more.\n\n\"We thought, when our patron told us this, that he referred to the\nmoney being lost to him, but it appears he referred to the ship;\nindeed it was very inconsiderate to have taken the wealth of a\nparricide on board; we could not expect any good fortune with such a\nfreight, and so it proved. When the ship was lost, our patron was very\nanxious to save the money; it was put on the raft, and when we landed,\nit was taken on shore and buried, that it might be restored and given\nto the church to which it had been bequeathed; but the men who buried\nit are all dead, and there is no one but my friend here, the patron,\nwho knows the spot.--I forgot to say, that as soon as the money was\nlanded on the island and buried, the spectre appeared as before, and\nseated himself over the spot where the money was interred. I think, if\nthis had not been the case, the seamen would have taken possession of\nit. But, by his appearance here this day, I presume he is tired, and\nhas deserted his charge, or else has come here that the money might be\nsent for, though I cannot understand why.\"\n\n\"Strange--very strange!--so there is a large treasure buried in the\nsand?\"\n\n\"There is.\"\n\n\"I should think, by the spectre's coming here, that it has abandoned\nit.\"\n\n\"Of course it has, or it would not be here.\"\n\n\"What can you imagine to have been the cause of its coming?\"\n\n\"Probably to announce its intention, and request my friend to have the\ntreasure sent for; but you know he was interrupted.\"\n\n\"Very true; but he called your friend Vanderdecken.\"\n\n\"It was the name which he took on board of the ship.\"\n\n\"And it was the name of the lady.\"\n\n\"Very true; he fell in with her at the Cape of Good Hope and brought\nher away with him.\"\n\n\"Then she is his wife?\"\n\n\"I must not answer that question. It is quite sufficient that he\ntreats her as his wife.\"\n\n\"Ah! indeed. But about this treasure. You say that no one knows where\nit is buried, but the patron as you call him?\"\n\n\"No one.\"\n\n\"Will you express my regret at what has passed, and tell him I will\nhave the pleasure of seeing him to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Certainly, signor,\" replied Krantz, rising from his chair; and\nwishing the Commandant a good evening as he retired.\n\n\"I was after one thing and have found another. A spectre that must\nhave been; but he must be a bold spectre that can frighten me from\ndoubloons--besides, I can call in the priests. Now, let me see; if I\nlet this man go on condition that he reveals the site of the treasure\nto the authorities, that is to _me_, why then I need not lose the fair\nyoung woman. If I forward this paper to her, why then I gain her--but\nI must first get rid of him. Of the two, I prefer--yes!--the gold! But\nI cannot obtain both. At all events, let me obtain the money first: I\nwant it more than the church does: but, if I do get the money; these\ntwo men can expose me. I must get rid of them; silence them for\never--and then perhaps I may obtain the fair Amine also. Yes, their\ndeath will be necessary to secure either--that is, after I have the\nfirst in my possession.--Let me think.\"\n\nFor some minutes the Commandant walked up and down the room,\nreflecting upon the best method of proceeding. \"He says it was a\nspectre, and he has told a plausible story,\" thought he; \"but I don't\nknow--I have my doubts--they may be tricking me. Well, be it so:\nif the money is there, I will have it; and if not, I will have my\nrevenge. Yes! I have it: not only must they be removed, but by\ndegrees all the others too who assist in bringing the treasure\naway;--then--but--who's there, Pedro?\"\n\n\"Yes, signor.\"\n\n\"How long have you been here?\"\n\n\"But as you spoke, signor: I thought I heard you call.\"\n\n\"You may go--I want nothing.\"\n\nPedro departed; but he had been some time in the room, and had\noverheard the whole of the Commandant's soliloquy.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXIV\n\n\nIt was a bright morning when the Portuguese vessel on which Amine was\non board entered into the bay and roadstead of Goa. Goa was then at\nits zenith--a proud, luxurious, superb, wealthy city, the capital of\nthe East, a City of Palaces, whose Viceroy reigned supreme. As they\napproached the river the two mouths of which form the island upon\nwhich Goa is built, the passengers were all on deck; and the\nPortuguese captain, who had often been there, pointed out to Amine the\nmost remarkable buildings. When they had passed the forts they entered\nthe river, the whole line of whose banks were covered with the country\nseats of the nobility and hidalgos--splendid buildings embosomed in\ngroves of orange trees, whose perfume scented the air.\n\n\"There, signora, is the country palace of the Viceroy,\" said the\ncaptain, pointing to a building which covered nearly three acres of\nground.\n\nThe ship sailed on until they arrived nearly abreast of the town, when\nAmine's eyes were directed to the lofty spires of the churches and\nother public edifices--for Amine had seen but little of cities during\nher life, as may be perceived when her history is recollected.\n\n\"That is the Jesuits' church, with their establishment,\" said the\ncaptain, pointing to a magnificent pile. \"In the church, now opening\nupon us, lay the canonised bones of the celebrated Saint Francisco,\nwho sacrificed his life in his zeal for the propagation of the gospel\nin these countries.\"\n\n\"I have heard of him from Father Mathias,\" replied Amine; \"but what\nbuilding is that?\"\n\n\"The Augustine convent; and the other, to the right, is the\nDominican.\"\n\n\"Splendid, indeed!\" observed Amine.\n\n\"The building you see now, on the water-side, is the Viceroy's palace;\nthat to the right, again, is the convent of the barefooted Carmelites:\nyon lofty spire is the cathedral of St Catherine, and that beautiful\nand light piece of architecture is the church of our Lady of Pity. You\nobserve there a building, with a dome, rising behind the Viceroy's\npalace?\"\n\n\"I do,\" replied Amine.\n\n\"That is the Holy Inquisition.\"\n\nAlthough Amine had heard Philip speak of the inquisition, she knew\nlittle about its properties; but a sudden tremor passed through her\nframe as the name was mentioned, which she could not herself account\nfor.\n\n\"Now we open upon the Viceroy's palace, and you perceive what a\nbeautiful building it is,\" continued the captain; \"that large pile a\nlittle above it is the Custom-house, abreast of which we shall come to\nan anchor. I must leave you now, signora.\"\n\nA few minutes afterwards the ship anchored opposite the Custom-house.\nThe captain and passengers went on shore, with the exception of Amine,\nwho remained in the vessel, while Father Mathias went in search of an\neligible place of abode.\n\nThe next morning the priest returned on board the ship, with the\nintelligence that he had obtained a reception for Amine in the\nUrsuline convent, the abbess of which establishment he was acquainted\nwith; and, before Amine went on shore, he cautioned her that the\nlady-abbess was a strict woman, and would be pleased if she conformed,\nas much as possible, to the rules of the convent; that this convent\nonly received young persons of the highest and most wealthy families,\nand he trusted that she would be happy there. He also promised to call\nupon her, and talk upon those subjects so dear to his heart, and so\nnecessary to her salvation. The earnestness and kindness with which\nthe old man spoke melted Amine to tears, and the holy father quitted\nher side to go down and collect her baggage, with a warmth of feeling\ntowards her which he had seldom felt before, and with greater hopes\nthan ever that his endeavours to convert her would not ultimately be\nthrown away.\n\n\"He is a good man,\" thought Amine, as she descended--and Amine was\nright. Father Mathias was a good man, but, like all men, he was\nnot perfect. A zealot in the cause of his religion, he would have\ncheerfully sacrificed his life as a martyr, but if opposed or thwarted\nin his views, he could then be cruel and unjust.\n\nFather Mathias had many reasons for placing Amine in the Ursuline\nconvent. He felt bound to offer her that protection which he had\nso long received under her roof; he wished her to be under the\nsurveillance of the abbess, for he could not help imagining, although\nhe had no proof, that she was still essaying or practising forbidden\narts. He did not state this to the abbess, as he felt it would be\nunjust to raise suspicions; but he represented Amine as one who would\ndo honour to their faith, to which she was not yet quite converted.\nThe very idea of effecting a conversion is to the tenants of a convent\nan object of surpassing interest, and the abbess was much better\npleased to receive one who required her councils and persuasions, than\na really pious Christian who would give her no trouble. Amine went on\nshore with Father Mathias; she refused the palanquin which had been\nprepared for her, and walked up to the convent. They landed between\nthe Custom-house and the Viceroy's palace, passed through to the large\nsquare behind it, and then went up the Strada Diretta, or Straight\nStreet, which led up to the Church of Pity, near to which the convent\nis situated. This street is the finest on Goa, and is called Strada\nDiretta, from the singular fact that almost all the streets in Goa are\nquadrants or segments of circles. Amine was astonished: the houses\nwere of stone, lofty and massive; at each story was thrown out a\nbalcony of marble, elaborately carved; and over each door were the\narms of the nobility, or hidalgos, to whom the houses belonged. The\nsquare behind the palace, and the wide streets, were filled with\nliving beings; elephants with gorgeous trappings; led or mounted\nhorses in superb housings; palanquins, carried by natives in splendid\nliveries; running footmen; syces; every variety of nation, from the\nproud Portuguese to the half-covered native; Mussulmans, Arabs,\nHindoos, Armenians; officers and soldiers in their uniforms, all\ncrowded and thronged together: all was bustle and motion. Such was\nthe wealth, the splendour, and luxury of the proud city of Goa--the\nEmpress of the East at the time we are now describing.\n\nIn half an hour they forced their way through the crowd, and arrived\nat the convent, where Amine was well received by the abbess; and after\na few minutes' conversation, Father Mathias took his leave: upon which\nthe abbess immediately set about her task of conversion. The first\nthing she did was to order some dried sweetmeats--not a bad beginning,\nas they were palatable; but as she happened to be very ignorant, and\nunaccustomed to theological disputes, her subsequent arguments did not\ngo down as well as the fruit. After a rambling discourse of about an\nhour, the old lady felt tired, and felt as if she had done wonders.\nAmine was then introduced to the nuns, most of whom were young and all\nof good family. Her dormitory was shown to her, and expressing a wish\nto be alone, she was followed into her chamber by only sixteen of\nthem, which was about as many as the chamber could well hold.\n\nWe must pass over the two months during which Amine remained in the\nconvent. Father Mathias had taken every step to ascertain if her\nhusband had been saved upon any of the islands which were under the\nPortuguese dominions, but could gain no information. Amine was soon\nweary of the convent; she was persecuted by the harangues of the old\nabbess, but more disgusted at the conduct and conversation of the\nnuns. They all had secrets to confide to her--secrets which had been\nconfided to the whole convent before: such secrets, such stories, so\ndifferent from Amine's chaste ideas, such impurity of thought that\nAmine was disgusted at them. But how could it be otherwise; the poor\ncreatures had been taken from the world in the full bloom of youth\nunder a ripening sun, and had been immured in this unnatural manner\nto gratify the avarice and pride of their families. Its inmates being\nwholly composed of the best families, the rules of this convent were\nnot so strict as others; licenses were given--greater licenses were\ntaken--and Amine, to her surprise, found that in this society, devoted\nto Heaven, there were exhibited more of the bad passions of human\nnature than she had before met with. Constantly watched, never allowed\na moment to herself, her existence became unbearable: and after three\nmonths she requested Father Mathias would find her some other place of\nrefuge; telling him frankly that her residence in that place was not\nvery likely to assist her conversion to the tenets of his faith.\nFather Mathias fully comprehended her, but replied, \"I have no means.\"\n\n\"Here are means,\" replied Amine, taking the diamond ring from her\nfinger: \"this is worth eight hundred ducats in our country; here I\nknow not how much.\"\n\nFather Mathias took the ring. \"I will call upon you to-morrow morning,\nand let you know what I have done. I shall acquaint the lady abbess\nthat you are going to your husband, for it would not be safe to let\nher suppose that you have reasons for quitting the convent. I have\nheard what you state mentioned before, but have treated it as scandal;\nbut you, I know, are incapable of falsehood.\"\n\nThe next day Father Mathias returned, and had an interview with the\nabbess, who after a time sent for Amine, and told her that it was\nnecessary that she should leave the convent. She consoled her as well\nas she could at leaving such a happy place, sent for some sweetmeats\nto make the parting less trying, gave her her blessing, and made her\nover to Father Mathias; who, when they were alone, informed Amine that\nhe had disposed of the ring for eighteen hundred dollars, and had\nprocured apartments for her in the house of a widow lady, with whom\nshe was to board.\n\nTaking leave of the nuns, Amine quitted the convent with Father\nMathias, and was soon installed in her new apartments, in a house\nwhich formed part of a spacious square called the Terra di Sabaio.\nAfter the introduction to her hostess, Father Mathias left her. Amine\nfound her apartments fronting the square, airy and commodious. The\nlandlady, who had escorted her to view them, not having left her, she\ninquired \"what large church that was on the other side of the square?\"\n\n\"It is the Ascension,\" replied the lady; \"the music is very fine\nthere; we will go and hear it to-morrow, if you please.\"\n\n\"And that massive building in face of us?\"\n\n\"That is the Holy Inquisition,\" said the widow, crossing herself.\n\nAmine again started, she knew not why. \"Is that your child?\" said\nAmine, as a boy of about twelve years old entered the room.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the widow, \"the only one that is left me. May God\npreserve him.\" The boy was handsome and intelligent, and Amine, for\nher own reasons, did everything she could to make friends with him,\nand was successful.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXV\n\n\nAmine had just returned from an afternoon's walk through the streets\nof Goa; she had made some purchases at different shops in the bazaar,\nand had brought them home under her mantilla. \"Here, at last, thank\nHeaven, I am alone and not watched,\" thought Amine, as she threw\nherself on the couch. \"Philip, Philip, where are you?\" exclaimed she;\n\"I have now the means, and I soon will know.\" Little Pedro, the son of\nthe widow, entered the room, ran up to Amine, and kissed her. \"Tell\nme, Pedro, where is your mother?\"\n\n\"She has gone out to see her friends this evening, and we are alone. I\nwill stay with you.\"\n\n\"Do so, dearest. Tell me, Pedro, can you keep a secret?\"\n\n\"Yes, I will--tell it me.\"\n\n\"Nay, I have nothing to tell, but I wish to do something: I wish to\nmake a play, and you shall see things in your hand.\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, shew me, do shew me.\"\n\n\"If you promise not to tell.\"\n\n\"No, by the Holy Virgin, I will not.\"\n\n\"Then you shall see.\"\n\nAmine lighted some charcoal in a chafing dish, and put it at her feet;\nshe then took a reed pen, some ink from a small bottle, and a pair of\nscissors, and wrote down several characters on a paper, singing,\nor rather chanting, words which were not intelligible to her young\ncompanion. Amine then threw frankincense and coriander seed into the\nchafing dish, which threw out a strong aromatic smoke; and desiring\nPedro to sit down by her on a small stool, she took the boy's right\nhand and held it in her own. She then drew upon the palm of his hand\na square figure with characters on each side of it, and in the centre\npoured a small quantity of the ink, so as to form a black mirror of\nthe size of a half-a-crown.\n\n\"Now all is ready,\" said Amine; \"look, Pedro, what see you in the\nink?\"\n\n\"My own face,\" replied the boy.\n\nShe threw more frankincense upon the chafing dish, until the room was\nfull of smoke, and then chanted.\n\n\"Turshoon, turyo-shoon--come down, come down.\n\n\"Be present, ye servants of these names.\n\n\"Remove the veil, and be correct.\"\n\nThe characters she had drawn upon the paper she had divided with the\nscissors, and now taking one of the pieces, she dropped it into the\nchafing dish, still holding the boy's hand.\n\n\"Tell me now, Pedro, what do you see?\"\n\n\"I see a man sweeping,\" replied Pedro, alarmed.\n\n\"Fear not, Pedro, you shall see more. Has he done sweeping?\"\n\n\"Yes, he has.\"\n\nAnd Amine muttered words, which were unintelligible, and threw into\nthe chafing dish the other half of the paper with the characters she\nhad written down. \"Say now, Pedro, Philip Vanderdecken, appear.\"\n\n\"Philip Vanderdecken, appear!\" responded the boy, trembling.\n\n\"Tell me what thou seest, Pedro--tell me true?\" said Amine, anxiously.\n\n\"I see a man lying down on the white sand; (I don't like this play.)\"\n\n\"Be not alarmed, Pedro, you shall have sweetmeats directly. Tell me\nwhat thou seest, how the man is dressed?\"\n\n\"He has a short coat--he has white trousers--he looks about him--he\ntakes something out of his breast and kisses it.\"\n\n\"'Tis he! 'tis he! and he lives! Heaven, I thank thee. Look again,\nboy.\"\n\n\"He gets up (I don't like this play; I am frightened; indeed I am.)\"\n\n\"Fear not.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I am--I cannot,\" replied Pedro, falling on his knees; \"pray\nlet me go,\"\n\nPedro had turned his hand, and spilt the ink, the charm was broken,\nand Amine could learn no more. She soothed the boy with presents, made\nhim repeat his promise that he would not tell, and postponed further\nsearch into fate until the boy should appear to have recovered from\nhis terror, and be willing to resume the ceremonies.\n\n\"My Philip lives--mother, dear mother, I thank you.\"\n\nAmine did not allow Pedro to leave the room until he appeared to\nhave quite recovered from his fright; for some days she did not say\nanything to him, except to remind him of his promise not to tell his\nmother, or any one else, and she loaded him with presents.\n\nOne afternoon when his mother was gone out, Pedro came in, and asked\nAmine \"whether they should not have the play over again?\"\n\nAmine, who was anxious to know more, was glad of the boy's request,\nand soon had everything prepared. Again was her chamber filled\nwith the smoke of the frankincense: again was she muttering her\nincantations: the magic mirror was on the boy's hand, and once more\nhad Pedro cried out, \"Philip Vanderdecken, appear!\" when the door\nburst open, and Father Mathias, the widow, and several other people\nmade their appearance. Amine started up--Pedro screamed and ran to his\nmother.\n\n\"Then I was not mistaken at what I saw in the cottage at Terneuse,\"\ncried Father Mathias, with his arms folded over his breast, and with\nlooks of indignation; \"accursed sorceress! you are detected.\"\n\nAmine returned his gaze with scorn, and coolly replied, \"I am not of\nyour creed--you know it. Eaves-dropping appears to be a portion of\nyour religion. This is my chamber--it is not the first time I have had\nto request you to leave it--I do so now--you--and those who have come\nin with you.\"\n\n\"Take up all those implements of sorcery first,\" said Father Mathias\nto his companions. The chafing dish, and other articles used by Amine,\nwere taken away; and Father Mathias and the others quitting the room,\nAmine was left alone.\n\nAmine had a foreboding that she was lost; she knew that magic was a\ncrime of the highest degree in Catholic countries, and that she had\nbeen detected in the very act. \"Well, well;\" thought Amine; \"it is my\ndestiny, and I can brave the worst.\"\n\nTo account for the appearance of Father Mathias and the witnesses, it\nmust be observed, that the little boy Pedro had, the day after Amine's\nfirst attempt, forgotten his promise, and narrated to his mother all\nthat had passed. The widow, frightened at what the boy had told her,\nthought it right to go to Father Mathias, and confide to him what her\nson had told her, as it was, in her opinion, sorcery. Father Mathias\nquestioned Pedro closely, and, convinced that such was the case,\ndetermined to have witnesses to confront Amine. He therefore proposed\nthat the boy should appear to be willing to try again, and had\ninstructed him for the purpose, having previously arranged that they\nshould break in upon Amine, as we have described.\n\nAbout half-an-hour afterwards, two men dressed in black gowns came\ninto Amine's room, and requested that she would follow them, or that\nforce would be used. Amine made no resistance; they crossed the\nsquare; the gate of a large building was opened; they desired her to\nwalk in, and, in a few seconds, Amine found herself in one of the\ndungeons of the Inquisition.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXVI\n\n\nPrevious to continuing our narrative, it may be as well to give\nour readers some little insight into the nature, ceremonies, and\nregulations of the Inquisition; and in describing that of Goa, we may\nbe said to describe all others, with very trifling, if any, variation.\n\nThe Santa Casa, or Inquisition of Goa, is situated on one side of a\nlarge square, called the Terra di Sabaio. It is a massive handsome\npile of stone buildings, with three doors in the front: the centre one\nis larger than the two lateral, and it is through the centre door that\nyou go into the Hall of Judgment. The side-doors lead to spacious and\nhandsome apartments for the Inquisitors, and officers attached to the\nestablishment.\n\nBehind these apartments are the cells and dungeons of the Inquisition;\nthey are in two long galleries, with double doors to each, and are\nabout ten feet square. There are about two hundred of them; some are\nmuch more comfortable than the others, as light and air are admitted\ninto them: others are wholly dark. In the galleries the keepers watch,\nand not a word or a sound can proceed from any cell without their\nbeing able to overhear it. The treatment of those confined is, as\nfar as respects their food, very good: great care is taken that the\nnourishment is of that nature that the prisoners may not suffer from\nthe indigestion arising from want of exercise. Surgical attendance\nis also permitted them; but, unless on very particular occasions,\nno priests are allowed to enter. Any consolation to be derived from\nreligion, even the office of confessor and extreme unction, in case\nof dissolution, are denied them. Should they die during their\nconfinement, whether proved guilty or not of the crime of which they\nare accused, they are buried without any funeral ceremony, and tried\nafterwards, if then found guilty, their bones are disinterred, and the\nexecution of their sentence is passed upon their remains.\n\nThere are two Inquisitors at Goa: one the Grand Inquisitor, and\nthe other his second, who are invariably chosen from the order\nof St-Dominique; these two are assisted in their judgment and\nexaminations by a large number selected from the religious orders,\nwho are termed deputies of the Holy Office, but who only attend when\nsummoned: they have other officers, whose duty it is to examine all\npublished books, and ascertain if there is anything in their pages\ncontrary to the holy religion. There is also a public accuser, a\nprocureur of the Inquisition, and lawyers, who are permitted to plead\nthe case of the prisoners, but whose chief business and interest it is\nto obtain their secrets and betray them. What are termed _Familiars_\nof the Inquisition, are, in fact, nothing but this description of\npeople: but this disgraceful office is taken upon themselves by the\nhighest nobility, who think it an honour as well as a security, to be\nenrolled among the Familiars of the Inquisition, who are thus to\nbe found dispersed throughout society; and every careless word, or\nexpression, is certain to be repeated to the Holy Office. A summons\nto attend at the Inquisition is never opposed; if it were, the whole\npopulace would rise and enforce it. Those who are confined in the\ndungeons of the Inquisition are kept separate; it is a very uncommon\nthing to put two together: it is only done when it is considered that\nthe prolonged solitude of the dungeon has created such a depression\nof spirits as to endanger the life of the party. Perpetual silence is\nenjoined and strictly kept. Those who wail or weep, or even pray, in\ntheir utter darkness, are forced by blows to be quiet. The cries\nand shrieks of those who suffer from this chastisement, or from\nthe torture, are carried along the whole length of the corridors,\nterrifying those who, in solitude and darkness, are anticipating the\nsame fate.\n\nThe first question put to a person arrested by the Inquisition, is\na demand, \"What is his property?\" He is desired to make an exact\ndeclaration of everything that he is worth, and swear to the truth of\nhis assertions; being informed that, if there is any reservation on\nhis part (although he may be at that time innocent of the charges\nproduced against him),--he will, by his concealment, have incurred the\nwrath of the Inquisition; and that, if discharged for the crime he is\naccused of, he will again be arrested for having taken a false oath to\nthe Inquisition; that, if innocent, his property will be safe, and not\ninterfered with. It is not without reason that this demand is made. If\na person accused confesses his crime, he is, in most cases, eventually\nallowed to go free, but all his property becomes confiscated.\n\nBy the rules of the Inquisition, it is made to appear as if those\ncondemned have the show of justice; for, although two witnesses are\nsufficient to warrant the apprehension of any individual, seven are\nnecessary to convict him; but as the witnesses are never confronted\nwith the prisoners, and torture is often applied to the witnesses, it\nis not difficult to obtain the number required. Many a life is falsely\nsworn away by the witness, that he may save his own. The chief crimes\nwhich are noticed by the Inquisition are those of sorcery, heresy,\nblasphemy, and what is called Judaism.\n\nTo comprehend the meaning of this last crime, for which more people\nhave suffered from the Inquisition than for any other, the reader must\nbe informed, that when Ferdinand and Isabella of Castile drove all the\nJews out of Spain, they fled to Portugal, where they were received on\nthe sole condition that they should embrace Christianity: this they\nconsented, or appeared to consent, to do; but these converts were\ndespised by the Portuguese people, who did not believe them to\nbe sincere. They obtained the title of _New_ Christians, in\ncontradistinction to that of _Old_ Christians. After a time the two\nwere occasionally intermingled in marriage; but when so, it was always\na reproach to the old families; and descendants from these alliances\nwere long termed, by way of reproach, as having a portion of the New\nChristians in them.\n\nThe descendants of the old families thus intermingled, not only lost\n_caste_, but, as the genealogy of every family was well known, they\nwere looked upon with suspicion, and were always at the mercy of the\nHoly Office, when denounced for Judaism,--that is, for returning\nto the old Jewish practices of keeping the Passover, and the other\nceremonies enforced by Moses.\n\nLet us see how an accusation of this kind works in the hands of the\nInquisition. A really sincere Catholic, descended from one of these\nunhappy families, is accused and arrested by the orders of the\nInquisition; he is ordered to declare his property, which,--convinced\nof his innocence, and expecting soon to be released, he does without\nreservation. But hardly has the key of the dungeon turned upon him,\nwhen all his effects are seized and sold by public auction; it being\nwell understood that they never will be restored to him. After some\nmonths' confinement, he is called into the Hall of Justice, and asked\nif he knows why he is in prison; they advise him earnestly to confess\nand to conceal nothing, as it is the only way by which he can obtain\nhis liberty. He declares his ignorance, and being sent for several\ntimes, persists in it. The period of the _Auto da Fé_, or Act of\nFaith, which takes place every two or three years (that is, the public\nexecution of those who have been found guilty by the Inquisition),\napproaches. The public accuser then comes forward, stating that the\nprisoner has been accused by a number of witnesses of Judaism. They\npersuade him to acknowledge his guilt; he persists in his innocence;\nthey then pass a sentence on him, which they term _Convicto Invotivo_,\nwhich means \"found guilty, but will not confess his crime;\" and he is\nsentenced to be burnt at the approaching celebration. After this they\nfollow him to his cell, and exhort him to confess his guilt, and\npromise that if he does confess he shall be pardoned; and these\nappeals are continued until the evening of the day before his\nexecution. Terrified at the idea of a painful death, the wretch,\nat last, to save his life, consents. He is called into the Hall of\nJudgment, confesses the crime that he has not committed, and imagines\nthat he is now saved.--Alas! no; he has entangled himself, and cannot\nescape.\n\n\"You acknowledge that you have been guilty of observing the laws of\nMoses. These ceremonies cannot be performed alone; you cannot have\neaten the Paschal lamb _alone_; tell us immediately, who were those\nwho assisted at those ceremonies, or your life is still forfeited, and\nthe stake is prepared for you.\"\n\nThus has he accused himself without gaining anything, and if he wishes\nto save his life he must accuse others; and who can be accused but\nhis own friends and acquaintances? nay, in all probability, his own\nrelations--his brothers, sisters, wife, sons or daughters--for it is\nnatural to suppose that in all such practices a man will trust only\nhis own family. Whether a man confesses his guilt, or dies asserting\nhis innocence, his worldly property is in either case confiscated; but\nit is of great consequence to the Inquisition that he should confess,\nas his act of confession, with his signature annexed, is publicly\nread, and serves to prove to the world that the Inquisition is\nimpartial and just; nay, more, even merciful, as it pardons those who\nhave been proved to be guilty.\n\nAt Goa the accusations of sorcery and magic were much more frequent\nthan at the Inquisitions at other places, arising from the customs\nand ceremonies of the Hindoos being very much mixed up with absurd\nsuperstitions. These people, and the slaves from other parts, very\noften embraced Christianity to please their masters; but since, if\nthey had been baptised and were afterwards convicted of any crime,\nthey were sentenced to the punishment by fire; whereas, if they had\nnot been baptised, they were only punished by whipping, imprisonment,\nor the galleys; upon this ground alone many refused to embrace\nChristianity.\n\nWe have now detailed all that we consider, up to the present,\nnecessary for the information of the reader; all that is omitted he\nwill gather as we proceed with our history.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXVII\n\n\nA few hours after Amine had been in the dungeon, the jailors entered:\nwithout speaking to her they let down her soft silky hair, and cut\nit close off. Amine, with her lip curled in contempt, and without\nresistance and expostulation, allowed them to do their work. They\nfinished, and she was again left to her solitude.\n\nThe next day the jailors entered her cell, and ordered her to bare her\nfeet, and follow them. She looked at them, and they at her. \"If you do\nnot, we must,\" observed one of the men, who was moved by her youth\nand beauty. Amine did as she was desired and was led into the Hall of\nJustice, where she found only the Grand Inquisitor and the Secretary.\n\nThe Hall of Justice was a long room with lofty windows on each side,\nand also at the end opposite to the door through which she had been\nled in. In the centre, on a raised dais, was a long table covered with\na cloth of alternate blue and fawn-coloured stripes; and at the\nend opposite to where Amine was brought in was raised an enormous\ncrucifix, with a carved image of our Saviour. The jailor pointed to a\nsmall bench, and intimated to Amine that she was to sit down.\n\nAfter a scrutiny of some moments, the Secretary spoke:--\n\n\"What is your name?\"\n\n\"Amine Vanderdecken.\"\n\n\"Of what country?\"\n\n\"My husband is of the Low Countries; I am from the East.\"\n\n\"What is your husband?\"\n\n\"The captain of a Dutch Indiaman.\"\n\n\"How came you here?\"\n\n\"His vessel was wrecked, and we were separated.\"\n\n\"Whom do you know here?\"\n\n\"Father Mathias.\"\n\n\"What property have you?\"\n\n\"None; it is my husband's.\"\n\n\"Where is it?\"\n\n\"In the custody of Father Mathias.\"\n\n\"Are you aware why you are brought here?\"\n\n\"How should I be?\" replied Amine, evasively; \"tell me what I am\naccused of.\"\n\n\"You must know whether you have done wrong or not. You had better\nconfess all your conscience accuses you of.\"\n\n\"My conscience does not accuse me of doing wrong.\"\n\n\"Then you will confess nothing?\"\n\n\"By your own showing, I have nothing to confess.\"\n\n\"You say you are from the East: are you a Christian?\"\n\n\"I reject your creed.\"\n\n\"You are married to a Catholic?\"\n\n\"Yes! a true Catholic.\"\n\n\"Who married you?\"\n\n\"Father Seysen, a Catholic priest.\"\n\n\"Did you enter into the bosom of the church?--did he venture to marry\nyou without your being baptised?\"\n\n\"Some ceremony did take place which I consented to.\"\n\n\"It was baptism, was it not?\"\n\n\"I believe it was so termed.\"\n\n\"And now you say that you reject the creed?\"\n\n\"Since I have witnessed the conduct of those who profess it, I do: at\nthe time of my marriage I was disposed towards it.\"\n\n\"What is the amount of your property in the Father Mathias's hands?\"\n\n\"Some hundreds of dollars--he knows exactly.\"\n\nThe Grand Inquisitor rang a bell; the jailors entered, and Amine was\nled back to her dungeon.\n\n\"Why should they ask so often about my money?\" mused Amine; \"If they\nrequire it, they may take it. What is their power? What would they do\nwith me? Well, well, a few days will decide.\" A few days!--no, no,\nAmine; years perhaps would have passed without decision, but that in\nfour months from the date of your incarceration, the _Auto da Fé_,\nwhich had not been celebrated for upwards of three years, was to take\nplace, and there was not a sufficient number of those who were to\nundergo the last punishment to render the ceremony imposing. A few\nmore were required for the stake, or you would not have escaped from\nthose dungeons so soon. As it was, a month of anxiety and suspense,\nalmost insupportable, had to be passed away, before Amine was again\nsummoned to the Hall of Justice.\n\nAmine, at the time we have specified, was again introduced to the Hall\nof Justice, and was again asked if she would confess. Irritated at her\nlong confinement, and the injustice of the proceedings, she replied,\n\"I have told you once for all, that I have nothing to confess; do with\nme as you will; but be quick.\"\n\n\"Will torture oblige you to confess?\"\n\n\"Try me,\" replied Amine, firmly--\"try me, cruel men; and if you gain\nbut one word from me, then call me craven: I am but a woman--but I\ndare you--I defy you.\"\n\nIt was seldom that such expressions fell upon the ears of her judges,\nand still more seldom that a countenance was lighted up with such\ndetermination. But the torture was never applied until after the\naccusation had been made and answered.\n\n\"We shall see,\" said the Grand Inquisitor: \"take her away.\"\n\nAmine was led back to her cell. In the meantime, Father Mathias had\nhad several conferences with the Inquisitor. Although, in his wrath he\nhad accused Amine, and had procured the necessary witnesses against\nher, he now felt uneasy and perplexed. His long residence with\nher--her invariable kindness till the time of his dismissal--his\nknowledge that she had never embraced the faith--her boldness and\ncourage, nay, her beauty and youth--all worked strongly in her favour.\nHis only object now was, to persuade her to confess that she was\nwrong, induce her to embrace the faith, and save her. With this view\nhe had obtained permission from the Holy Office to enter her dungeon,\nand reason with her--a special favour which for many reasons they\ncould not well refuse him. It was on the third day after her second\nexamination, that the bolts were removed at an unusual hour, and\nFather Mathias entered the cell, which was again barred, and he was\nleft alone with Amine. \"My child! my child!\" exclaimed Father Mathias,\nwith sorrow in his countenance.\n\n\"Nay, Father, this is mockery. It is you who brought me here--leave\nme.\"\n\n\"I brought you here, 'tis true; but I would now remove you, if you\nwill permit me, Amine.\"\n\n\"Most willingly; I'll follow you.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay! there is much to talk over, much to be done. This is not a\ndungeon from which people can escape so easily.\"\n\n\"Then tell me what have you to say; and what is it must be done?\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\n\"But, stop; before you say one word answer me one question as you hope\nfor bliss: have you heard aught of Philip?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have. He is well.\"\n\n\"And where is he?\"\n\n\"He will soon be here.\"\n\n\"God, I thank you! Shall I see him, Father?\"\n\n\"That must depend upon yourself.\"\n\n\"Upon myself. Then tell me, quickly, what would they have me do?\"\n\n\"Confess your sins--your crimes.\"\n\n\"What sins?--what crimes?\"\n\n\"Have you not dealt with evil beings, invoked the spirits, and gained\nthe assistance of those who are not of this world?\"\n\nAmine made no reply.\n\n\"Answer me. Do you not confess?\"\n\n\"I do not confess to have done anything wrong.\"\n\n\"This is useless. You were seen by me and others. What will avail your\ndenial? Are you aware of the punishment, which most surely awaits you,\nif you do not confess, and become a member of our church?\"\n\n\"Why am I to become a member of your church? Do you, then, punish\nthose who refuse?\"\n\n\"No: had you not already consented to receive baptism, you would not\nhave been asked to become so; but having been baptised, you must now\nbecome a member, or be supposed to fall back into heresy.\"\n\n\"I knew not the nature of your baptism at that time.\"\n\n\"Granted: but you consented to it.\"\n\n\"Be it so. But, pray, what may be the punishment, if I refuse?\"\n\n\"You will be burnt alive at the stake; nothing can save you. Hear me,\nAmine Vanderdecken: when next summoned, you must confess all; and,\nasking pardon, request to be received into the church; then will you\nbe saved, and you will--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Again be clasped in Philip's arms.\"\n\n\"My Philip! my Philip! you, indeed, press me hard; but, Father, if I\nconfess I am wrong, when I feel that I am not\"\n\n\"Feel that you are not!\"\n\n\"Yes. I invoked my mother's assistance; she gave it me in a dream.\nWould a mother have assisted her daughter, if it were wrong?\"\n\n\"It was not your mother, but a fiend who took the likeness.\"\n\n\"It was my mother. Again you ask me to say that I believe that which I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That which you cannot! Amine Vanderdecken, be not obstinate.\"\n\n\"I am not obstinate, good Father. Have you not offered me, what is to\nme beyond all price, that I should again be in the arms of my husband?\nCan I degrade myself to a lie? not for life, or liberty or even for my\nPhilip.\"\n\n\"Amine Vanderdecken, if you will confess your crime, before you are\naccused, you will have done much; after your accusation has been made,\nit will be of little avail.\"\n\n\"It will not be done either before or after, Father. What I have done\nI have done, but a crime it is not to me and mine; with you it may be,\nbut I am not of yours.\"\n\n\"Recollect also that you peril your husband, for having wedded with a\nsorceress. Forget not: to-morrow I will see you again.\"\n\n\"My mind is troubled,\" replied Amine. \"Leave me, Father, it will be a\nkindness.\"\n\nFather Mathias quitted the cell, pleased with the last words of Amine.\nThe idea of her husband's danger seemed to have startled her.\n\nAmine threw herself down on the mattress, in the corner of the cell,\nand hid her face.\n\n\"Burnt alive!\" exclaimed she after a time, sitting up, and passing her\nhands over her forehead. \"Burnt alive! and these are Christians.\nThis, then, was the cruel death foretold by that creature,\nSchriften--foretold--yes, and therefore must be: it is my destiny:\nI cannot save myself. If I confess, then, I confess that Philip is\nwedded to a sorceress, and he will be punished too. No, never--never:\nI can suffer, 'tis cruel--'tis horrible to think of--but 'twill soon\nbe over. God of my fathers, give me strength against these wicked men,\nand enable me to bear all, for my dear Philip's sake.\"\n\nThe next evening Father Mathias again made his appearance. He found\nAmine calm and collected: she refused to listen to his advice, or\nfollow his injunctions. His last observation, that \"her husband would\nbe in peril, if she was found guilty of sorcery,\" had steeled her\nheart, and she had determined that neither torture nor the stake\nshould make her confess the act. The priest left the cell, sick at\nheart; he now felt miserable at the idea of Amine's perishing by so\ndreadful a death; accused himself of precipitation, and wished that he\nhad never seen Amine, whose constancy and courage, although in error,\nexcited his admiration and his pity. And then he thought of Philip,\nwho had treated him so kindly--how could he meet him? And if he asked\nfor his wife--what answer could he give?\n\nAnother fortnight passed, when Amine was again summoned to the Hall\nof Judgment, and again asked if she confessed her crimes. Upon her\nrefusal, the accusations against her were read. She was accused by\nFather Mathias with practising forbidden arts, and the depositions of\nthe boy Pedro, and the other witnesses, were read. In his zeal, Father\nMathias also stated that he had found her guilty of the same practices\nat Terneuse; and moreover, that in the violent storm when all expected\nto perish, she had remained calm and courageous, and told the captain\nthat they would be saved; which could only have been known by an undue\nspirit of prophecy, given by evil spirits. Amine's lip curled in\nderision when she heard the last accusation. She was asked if she had\nany defence to make.\n\n\"What defence can be offered,\" replied she, \"to such accusations\nas these? Witness the last--because I was not so craven as the\nChristians, I am accused of sorcery. The old dotard! but I will expose\nhim. Tell me, if one knows that sorcery is used, and conceals or\nallows it, is he not a participator and equally guilty?\"\n\n\"He is,\" replied the Inquisitor, anxiously awaiting the result.\n\n\"Then I denounce\" And Amine was about to reveal that Philip's mission\nwas known, and not forbidden by Fathers Mathias and Seysen; when\nrecollecting that Philip would be implicated, she stopped.\n\n\"Denounce whom?\" inquired the Inquisitor.\n\n\"No one,\" replied Amine, folding her arms and drooping her head.\n\n\"Speak, woman.\"\n\nAmine made no answer.\n\n\"The torture will make you speak.\"\n\n\"Never!\" replied Amine. \"Never! Torture me to death, if you choose; I\nprefer it to a public execution.\"\n\nThe Inquisitor and the Secretary consulted a short time. Convinced\nthat Amine would adhere to her resolution, and requiring her for\npublic execution, they abandoned the idea of the torture.\n\n\"Do you confess?\" inquired the Inquisitor.\n\n\"No,\" replied Amine, firmly.\n\n\"Then take her away.\"\n\nThe night before the _Auto da Fé_, Father Mathias again entered the\ncell of Amine, but all his endeavours to convert her were useless.\n\n\"To-morrow will end it all, Father,\" replied Amine; \"leave me--I would\nbe alone.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXVIII\n\n\nWe must now return to Philip and Krantz. When the latter retired from\nthe presence of the Portuguese Commandant, he communicated to Philip\nwhat had taken place, and the fabulous tale which he had invented to\ndeceive the Commandant. \"I said that you alone knew where the treasure\nwas concealed,\" continued Krantz, \"that you might be sent for, for in\nall probability he will keep me as a hostage: but never mind that, I\nmust take my chance. Do you contrive to escape somehow or another, and\nrejoin Amine.\"\n\n\"Not so,\" replied Philip, \"you must go with me, my friend: I feel that\nshould I part with you, happiness would no longer be in store for me.\"\n\n\"Nonsense--that is but an idle feeling; besides, I will evade him\nsomehow or another.\"\n\n\"I will not show the treasure, unless you go with me.\"\n\n\"Well--you may try it at all events.\"\n\nA low tap at the door was heard. Philip rose and opened it (for they\nhad retired to rest), and Pedro came in. Looking carefully round him,\nand then shutting the door softly, he put his finger on his lips to\nenjoin them to silence. He then in a whisper told them what he had\noverheard. \"Contrive, if possible, that I go with you,\" continued he;\n\"I must leave you now; he still paces his room.\" And Pedro slipped out\nof the door, and crawled stealthily away along the ramparts.\n\n\"The treacherous little rascal! But we will circumvent him, if\npossible,\" said Krantz, in a low tone. \"Yes, Philip, you are right, we\nmust both go, for you will require my assistance. I must persuade him\nto go himself. I'll think of it--so Philip, good-night.\"\n\nThe next morning Philip and Krantz were summoned to breakfast; the\nCommandant received them with smiles and urbanity. To Philip he\nwas peculiarly courteous. As soon as the repast was over, he thus\ncommunicated to him his intentions and wishes:--\n\n\"Signor, I have been reflecting upon what your friend told me, and the\nappearance of the spectre yesterday, which created such confusion; it\ninduced me to behave with a rashness for which I must now offer my\nmost sincere apologies. The reflections which I have made, joined with\nthe feelings of devotion which must be in the heart of every true\nCatholic, have determined me, with your assistance, to obtain this\ntreasure dedicated to the holy church. It is my proposal that you\nshould take a party of soldiers under your orders, proceed to the\nisland on which it is deposited, and having obtained it, return here.\nI will detain any vessel which may in the meantime put into the\nroadstead, and you shall then be the bearers of the treasure and of my\nletters to Goa. This will give you an honourable introduction to the\nauthorities, and enable you to pass away your time there in the most\nagreeable manner. You will also, signor, be restored to your wife,\nwhose charms had such an effect upon me; and for mention of whose name\nin the very unceremonious manner which I did, I must excuse myself\nupon the ground of total ignorance of who she was, or of her being in\nany way connected with your honourable person. If these measures suit\nyou, signor, I shall be most happy to give orders to that effect.\"\n\n\"As a good Catholic myself,\" replied Philip, \"I shall be most happy to\npoint out the spot where the treasure is concealed, and restore it to\nthe church. Your apologies relative to my wife I accept with pleasure,\nbeing aware that your conduct proceeded from ignorance of her\nsituation and rank; but I do not exactly see my way clear. You propose\na party of soldiers. Will they obey me?--Are they to be trusted?--I\nshall, have only myself and friend against them, and will they be\nobedient?\"\n\n\"No fear of that, signor, they are well disciplined; there is not even\noccasion for your friend to go with you. I wish to retain him with me,\nto keep me company during your absence.\"\n\n\"Nay! that I must object to,\" replied Philip; \"I will not trust myself\nalone.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I may be allowed to give an opinion on this subject,\"\nobserved Krantz; \"I see no reason, if my friend goes accompanied with\na party of soldiers only, why I should not go with him; but I consider\nit would be unadvisable that he proceed in the way the Commandant\nproposes, either with or without me. You must recollect, Commandant,\nthat it is no trifling sum which is to be carried away; that it will\nbe open to view, and will meet the eyes of your men; that these men\nhave been detained many years in this country, and are anxious to\nreturn home. When, therefore, they find themselves with only two\nstrangers with them--away from your authority, and in possession of a\nlarge sum of money--will not the temptation be too strong? They will\nonly have to run down the southern channel, gain the port of Bantam,\nand they will be safe; having obtained both freedom and wealth. To\nsend, therefore, my friend and me, would be to send us to almost\ncertain death; but if you were to go, Commandant, then the danger\nwould no longer exist. Your presence and your authority would control\nthem; and, whatever their wishes or thoughts might be, they would\nquail before the flash of your eye.\"\n\n\"Very true--very true,\" replied Philip--\"all this did not occur to\nme.\"\n\nNor had it occurred to the Commandant, but when pointed out, the force\nof these suggestions immediately struck him, and long before Krantz\nhad finished speaking, he had resolved to go himself.\n\n\"Well, signors,\" replied he; \"I am always ready to accede to your\nwishes; and since you consider my presence necessary, and as I do not\nthink there is any chance of another attack from the Ternate people\njust now, I will take upon myself the responsibility of leaving the\nfort for a few days under the charge of my lieutenant, while we do\nthis service to Holy Mother Church. I have already sent for one of the\nnative vessels, which are large and commodious, and will, with your\npermission, embark to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Two vessels will be better,\" observed Krantz; \"in the first place, in\ncase of an accident; and next because we can embark all the treasure\nin one with ourselves, and put a portion of the soldiers in the other;\nso that we may be in greater force, in case of the sight of so much\nwealth stimulating them to insubordination.\"\n\n\"True, signor, we will have two vessels; your advice is good.\"\n\nEverything was thus satisfactorily arranged, with the exception of\ntheir wish that Pedro should, accompany them on their expedition.\nThey were debating how this should be brought on the tapis, when the\nsoldier came to them, and stated that the Commandant had ordered him\nto be of the party, and that he was to offer his services to the two\nstrangers.\n\nOn the ensuing day everything was prepared. Ten soldiers and a\ncorporal had been selected by the Commandant; and it required but\nlittle time to put into the vessels the provisions and other articles\nwhich were required. At daylight they embarked--the Commandant and\nPhilip in one boat; Krantz, with the corporal and Pedro, in the\nother. The men, who had been kept in ignorance of the object of the\nexpedition, were now made acquainted with it by Pedro, and a long\nwhispering took place between them, much to the satisfaction of\nKrantz, who was aware that the mutiny would soon be excited, when\nit was understood that those who composed the expedition were to be\nsacrificed to the avarice of the Commandant. The weather being fine,\nthey sailed on during the night: passed the island of Ternate at ten\nleagues' distance; and before morning were among the cluster of isles,\nthe southernmost of which was the one on which the treasure had been\nburied. On the second night the vessels were beached upon a small\nisland; and then, for the first time, a communication took place\nbetween the soldiers who had been in the boat with Pedro and Krantz,\nand those who had been embarked with the Commandant. Philip and Krantz\nhad also an opportunity of communicating apart for a short time.\n\nWhen they made sail the next morning, Pedro spoke openly; he told\nKrantz that the soldiers in the boat had made up their minds, and that\nhe had no doubt that the others would do so before night; although\nthey had not decidedly agreed upon joining them in the morning when\nthey had re-embarked. That they would despatch the Commandant, and\nthen proceed to Batavia, and from thence obtain a passage home to\nEurope.\n\n\"Cannot you accomplish your end without murder?\"\n\n\"Yes, we could; but not our revenge. You do not know the treatment\nwhich we have received from his hands; and sweet as the money will be\nto us, his death will be even sweeter. Besides, has he not determined\nto murder us all in some way or another? It is but justice. No, no; if\nthere was no other knife ready--mine is.\"\n\n\"And so are all ours!\" cried the other soldiers, putting their hands\nto their weapons.\n\nOne more day's sail brought them within twenty miles of the island;\nfor Philip knew his landmarks well. Again they landed, and all retired\nto rest, the Commandant dreaming of wealth and revenge; while it was\narranging that the digging up of the treasure which he coveted should\nbe the signal for his death.\n\nOnce more did they embark, and the Commandant heeded not the dark and\nlowering faces with which he was surrounded. He was all gaiety and\npoliteness. Swiftly did they skim over the dark blue sea, between the\nbeautiful islands with which it was studded, and before the sun was\nthree hours high, Philip recognised the one sought after, and pointed\nout to the Commandant the notched cocoa-nut tree, which served as a\nguide to the spot where the money had been concealed. They landed on\nthe sandy beach, and the shovels were ordered to be brought on shore\nby the impatient little officer; who little thought that every moment\nof time gained was but so much _time_ lost to him, and that while he\nwas smiling and meditating treachery, that others could do the same.\n\nThe party arrived under the tree--the shovels soon removed the light\nsand, and, in a few minutes, the treasure was exposed to view. Bag\nafter bag was handed up, and the loose dollars collected into heaps.\nTwo of the soldiers had been sent to the vessels for sacks to put the\nloose dollars in, and the men had desisted from their labour; they\nlaid aside their spades, looks were exchanged, and all were ready.\n\nThe Commandant turned round to call to and hasten the movements of\nthe men who had been sent for the sacks, when three or four knives\nsimultaneously pierced him through the back; he fell, and was\nexpostulating when they were again buried in his bosom, and he lay a\ncorpse. Philip and Krantz remained silent spectators--the knives were\ndrawn out, wiped, and replaced in their sheathes.\n\n\"He has met his reward,\" said Krantz.\n\n\"Yes,\" exclaimed the Portuguese soldiers--\"justice, nothing but\njustice.\"\n\n\"Signors, you shall have your share,\" observed Pedro. \"Shall they not,\nmy men?\"\n\n\"Yes! yes!\"\n\n\"Not one dollar, my good friends,\" replied Philip; \"take all the\nmoney, and may you be happy; all we ask is, your assistance to proceed\non our way to where we are about to go. And now before you divide your\nmoney, oblige me by burying the body of that unfortunate man.\"\n\nThe soldiers obeyed. Resuming their shovels, they soon scooped out a\nshallow grave; the Commandant's body was thrown in, and covered up\nfrom sight.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXIX\n\n\nScarcely had the soldiers performed their task, and thrown down their\nshovels, when they commenced an altercation. It appeared that this\nmoney was to be again the cause of slaughter and bloodshed. Philip\nand Krantz determined to sail immediately in one of the peroquas,\nand leave them to settle their disputes as they pleased. He asked\npermission of the soldiers to take from the provisions and water,\nof which there was ample supply, a larger proportion than was their\nshare; stating, that he and Krantz had a long voyage and would require\nit, and pointing out to them that there were plenty of cocoa-nuts\nfor their support. The soldiers, who thought of nothing but their\nnewly-acquired wealth, allowed him to do as he pleased; and having\nhastily collected as many cocoa-nuts as they could, to add to their\nstock of provisions, before noon Philip and Krantz had embarked, and\nmade sail in the peroqua, leaving the soldiers with their knives again\ndrawn, and so busy in their angry altercation as to be heedless of\ntheir departure.\n\n\"There will be the same scene over again, I expect,\" observed Krantz,\nas the vessel parted swiftly from the shore.\n\n\"I have little doubt of it; observe, even now they are at blows and\nstabs.\"\n\n\"If I were to name that spot, it should be the '_Accursed Isle_.'\"\n\n\"Would not any other be the same, with so much to inflame the passions\nof men?\"\n\n\"Assuredly: what a curse is gold!\"\n\n\"And what a blessing!\" replied Krantz. \"I am sorry Pedro is left with\nthem.\"\n\n\"It is their destiny,\" replied Philip; \"so let's think no more of\nthem. Now what do you propose? With this vessel, small as she is, we\nmay sail over these seas in safety; and we have, I imagine, provisions\nsufficient for more than a month.\"\n\n\"My idea is to run into the track of the vessels going to the\nwestward, and obtain a passage to Goa.\"\n\n\"And if we do not meet with any, we can at all events proceed up the\nStraits as far as Pulo Penang without risk. There we may safely remain\nuntil a vessel passes.\"\n\n\"I agree with you; it is our best, nay our only place; unless, indeed,\nwe were to proceed to Cochin, where junks are always leaving for Goa.\"\n\n\"But that would be out of our way, and the junks cannot well pass us\nin the Straits without their being seen by us.\"\n\nThey had no difficulty in steering their course; the islands by day,\nand the clear stars by night, were their compass. It is true that\nthey did not follow the more direct track, but they followed the more\nsecure, working up through the smooth waters, and gaining to the\nnorthward more than to the west. Many times were they chased by the\nMalay proas, which infested the islands, but the swiftness of their\nlittle peroqua was their security; indeed the chase was, generally\nspeaking, abandoned, as soon as the smallness of the vessel was made\nout by the pirates, who expected that little or no booty was to be\ngained.\n\nThat Amine and Philip's mission was the constant theme of their\ndiscourse, may easily be imagined. One morning, as they were sailing\nbetween the isles, with less wind than usual, Philip observed:--\n\n\"Krantz, you said that there were events in your own life, or\nconnected with it, which would corroborate the mysterious tale I\nconfided to you. Will you now tell me to what you referred?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Krantz; \"I have often thought of doing so, but\none circumstance or another has hitherto prevented me; this is,\nhowever, a fitting opportunity. Prepare therefore to listen to a\nstrange story, quite as strange, perhaps, as your own.\n\n\"I take it for granted, that you have heard people speak of the Hartz\nMountains,\" observed Krantz.\n\n\"I have never heard people speak of them that I can recollect,\"\nreplied Philip; \"but I have read of them in some book, and of the\nstrange things which have occurred there.\"\n\n\"It is indeed a wild region,\" rejoined Krantz, \"and many strange tales\nare told of it; but, strange as they are, I have good reason for\nbelieving them to be true. I have told you, Philip, that I fully\nbelieve in your communion with the other world--that I credit the\nhistory of your father, and the lawfulness of your mission; for that\nwe are surrounded, impelled, and worked upon by beings different in\ntheir nature from ourselves, I have had full evidence, as you will\nacknowledge, when I state what has occurred in my own family. Why such\nmalevolent beings as I am about to speak of should be permitted to\ninterfere with us, and punish, I may say, comparatively unoffending\nmortals, is beyond my comprehension; but that they are so permitted is\nmost certain.\"\n\n\"The great principle of all evil fulfils his work of evil; why, then,\nnot the other minor spirits of the same class?\" inquired Philip. \"What\nmatters it to us, whether we are tried by, and have to suffer from,\nthe enmity of our fellow-mortals, or whether we are persecuted by\nbeings more powerful and more malevolent than ourselves? We know\nthat we have to work out our salvation, and that we shall be judged\naccording to our strength; if then there be evil spirits who delight\nto oppress man, there surely must be, as Amine asserts, good spirits,\nwhose delight is to do him service. Whether, then, we have to struggle\nagainst our passions only, or whether we have to struggle not only\nagainst our passions, but also the dire influence of unseen enemies,\nwe ever struggle with the same odds in our favour, as the good are\nstronger than the evil which we combat. In either case we are on the\n'vantage ground, whether, as in the first, we fight the good cause\nsingle-handed, or as in the second, although opposed, we have the host\nof Heaven ranged on our side. Thus are the scales of Divine Justice\nevenly balanced, and man is still a free agent, as his own virtuous or\nvicious propensities must ever decide whether he shall gain or lose\nthe victory.\"\n\n\"Most true,\" replied Krantz, \"and now to my history.\n\n\"My father was not born, or originally a resident, in the Hartz\nMountains; he was the serf of an Hungarian nobleman, of great\npossessions, in Transylvania; but, although a serf, he was not by\nany means a poor or illiterate man. In fact, he was rich, and his\nintelligence and respectability were such, that he had been raised\nby his lord to the stewardship; but, whoever may happen to be born a\nserf, a serf must he remain, even though he become a wealthy man; such\nwas the condition of my father. My father had been married for about\nfive years; and, by his marriage, had three children--my eldest\nbrother Caesar, myself (Hermann), and a sister named Marcella. You\nknow, Philip, that Latin is still the language spoken in that country;\nand that will account for our high sounding names. My mother was a\nvery beautiful woman, unfortunately more beautiful than virtuous: she\nwas seen and admired by the lord of the soil; my father was sent away\nupon some mission; and, during his absence, my mother, flattered by\nthe attentions, and won by the assiduities, of this nobleman,\nyielded to his wishes. It so happened that my father returned very\nunexpectedly, and discovered the intrigue. The evidence of my mother's\nshame was positive: he surprised her in the company of her seducer!\nCarried away by the impetuosity of his feelings, he watched the\nopportunity of a meeting taking place between them, and murdered both\nhis wife and her seducer. Conscious that, as a serf, not even the\nprovocation which he had received would be allowed as a justification\nof his conduct, he hastily collected together what money he could lay\nhis hands upon, and, as we were then in the depth of winter, he put\nhis horses to the sleigh, and taking his children with him, he set\noff in the middle of the night, and was far away before the tragical\ncircumstance had transpired. Aware that he would be pursued, and that\nhe had no chance of escape if he remained in any portion of his native\ncountry (in which the authorities could lay hold of him), he continued\nhis flight without intermission until he had buried himself in the\nintricacies and seclusion of the Hartz Mountains. Of course, all that\nI have now told you I learned afterwards. My oldest recollections are\nknit to a rude, yet comfortable cottage, in which I lived with my\nfather, brother, and sister. It was on the confines of one of those\nvast forests which cover the northern part of Germany; around it were\na few acres of ground, which, during the summer months, my father\ncultivated, and which, though they yielded a doubtful harvest, were\nsufficient for our support. In the winter we remained much in doors,\nfor, as my father followed the chase, we were left alone, and the\nwolves, during that season, incessantly prowled about. My father\nhad purchased the cottage, and land about it, of one of the rude\nforesters, who gain their livelihood partly by hunting, and partly\nby burning charcoal, for the purpose of smelting the ore from the\nneighbouring mines; it was distant about two miles from any other\nhabitation. I can call to mind the whole landscape now: the tall pines\nwhich rose up on the mountain above us, and the wide expanse of forest\nbeneath, on the topmost boughs and heads of whose trees we looked down\nfrom our cottage, as the mountain below us rapidly descended into the\ndistant valley. In summertime the prospect was beautiful; but during\nthe severe winter, a more desolate scene could not well be imagined.\n\n\"I said that, in the winter, my father occupied himself with the\nchase; every day he left us, and often would he lock the door, that we\nmight not leave the cottage. He had no one to assist him, or to take\ncare of us--indeed, it was not easy to find a female servant who would\nlive in such a solitude; but, could he have found one, my father would\nnot have received her, for he had imbibed a horror of the sex, as the\ndifference of his conduct towards us, his two boys, and my poor little\nsister, Marcella, evidently proved. You may suppose we were sadly\nneglected; indeed, we suffered much, for my father, fearful that we\nmight come to some harm, would not allow us fuel, when he left the\ncottage; and we were obliged, therefore, to creep under the heaps of\nbears'-skins, and there to keep ourselves as warm as we could until he\nreturned in the evening, when a blazing fire was our delight. That my\nfather chose this restless sort of life may appear strange, but the\nfact was that he could not remain quiet; whether from remorse for\nhaving committed murder, or from the misery consequent on his change\nof situation, or from both combined, he was never happy unless he\nwas in a state of activity. Children, however, when left much to\nthemselves, acquire a thoughtfulness not common to their age. So it\nwas with us; and during the short cold days of winter we would sit\nsilent, longing for the happy hours when the snow would melt, and the\nleaves burst out, and the birds begin their songs, and when we should\nagain be set at liberty.\n\n\"Such was our peculiar and savage sort of life until my brother Caesar\nwas nine, myself seven, and my sister five, years old, when the\ncircumstances occurred on which is based the extraordinary narrative\nwhich I am about to relate.\n\n\"One evening my father returned home rather later than usual; he had\nbeen unsuccessful, and, as the weather was very severe, and many feet\nof snow were upon the ground, he was not only very cold, but in a very\nbad humour. He had brought in wood, and we were all three of us gladly\nassisting each other in blowing on the embers to create the blaze,\nwhen he caught poor little Marcella by the arm and threw her aside;\nthe child fell, struck her mouth, and bled very much. My brother ran\nto raise her up. Accustomed to ill usage, and afraid of my father,\nshe did not dare to cry, but looked up in his face very piteously.\nMy father drew his stool nearer to the hearth, muttered something\nin abuse of women, and busied himself with the fire, which both my\nbrother and I had deserted when our sister was so unkindly treated. A\ncheerful blaze was soon the result of his exertions; but we did not,\nas usual, crowd round it. Marcella, still bleeding, retired to a\ncorner, and my brother and I took our seats beside her, while my\nfather hung over the fire gloomily and alone. Such had been our\nposition for about half-an-hour, when the howl of a wolf, close under\nthe window of the cottage, fell on our ears. My father started up, and\nseized his gun: the howl was repeated, he examined the priming, and\nthen hastily left the cottage, shutting the door after him. We all\nwaited (anxiously listening), for we thought that if he succeeded in\nshooting the wolf, he would return in a better humour; and although\nhe was harsh to all of us, and particularly so to our little sister,\nstill we loved our father, and loved to see him cheerful and happy,\nfor what else had we to look up to? And I may here observe, that\nperhaps there never were three children who were fonder of each other;\nwe did not, like other children, fight and dispute together; and if,\nby chance, any disagreement did arise between my elder brother and me,\nlittle Marcella would run to us, and kissing us both, seal, through\nher entreaties, the peace between us. Marcella was a lovely, amiable\nchild; I can recall her beautiful features even now--Alas! poor little\nMarcella.\"\n\n\"She is dead then?\" observed Philip.\n\n\"Dead! yes, dead!--but how did she die?--But I must not anticipate,\nPhilip; let me tell my story.\n\n\"We waited for some time, but the report of the gun did not reach us,\nand my elder brother then said, 'Our father has followed the wolf, and\nwill not be back for some time. Marcella, let us wash the blood from\nyour mouth, and then we will leave this corner, and go to the fire and\nwarm ourselves.'\n\n\"We did so, and remained there until near midnight, every minute\nwondering, as it grew later, why our father did not return. We had\nno idea that he was in any danger, but we thought that he must have\nchased the wolf for a very long time. 'I will look out and see if\nfather is coming,' said my brother Caesar, going to the door. 'Take\ncare,' said Marcella, 'the wolves must be about now, and we cannot\nkill them, brother.' My brother opened the door very cautiously, and\nbut a few inches; he peeped out.--'I see nothing,' said he, after a\ntime, and once more he joined us at the fire. 'We have had no supper,'\nsaid I, for my father usually cooked the meat as soon as he came\nhome; and during his absence we had nothing but the fragments of the\npreceding day.\n\n\"'And if our father comes home after his hunt, Caesar,' said Marcella,\n'he will be pleased to have some supper; let us cook it for him and\nfor ourselves.' Caesar climbed upon the stool, and reached down some\nmeat--I forget now whether it was venison or bear's meat; but we cut\noff the usual quantity, and proceeded to dress it, as we used to do\nunder our father's superintendence. We were all busied putting it into\nthe platters before the fire, to await his coming, when we heard the\nsound of a horn. We listened--there was a noise outside, and a minute\nafterwards my father entered, ushering in a young female, and a large\ndark man in a hunter's dress.\n\n\"Perhaps I had better now relate, what was only known to me many years\nafterwards. When my father had left the cottage, he perceived a large\nwhite wolf about thirty yards from him; as soon as the animal saw\nmy father, it retreated slowly, growling and snarling. My father\nfollowed; the animal did not run, but always kept at some distance;\nand my father did not like to fire until he was pretty certain that\nhis ball would take effect: thus they went on for some time, the wolf\nnow leaving my father far behind, and then stopping and snarling\ndefiance at him, and then again, on his approach, setting off at\nspeed.\n\n\"Anxious to shoot the animal (for the white wolf is very rare), my\nfather continued the pursuit for several hours, during which he\ncontinually ascended the mountain.\n\n\"You must know, Philip, that there are peculiar spots on those\nmountains which are supposed, and, as my story will prove, truly\nsupposed, to be inhabited by the evil influences; they are well known\nto the huntsmen, who invariably avoid them. Now, one of these spots,\nan open space in the pine forests above us, had been pointed out to my\nfather as dangerous on that account. But, whether he disbelieved\nthese wild stories, or whether, in his eager pursuit of the chase, he\ndisregarded them, I know not; certain, however, it is, that he was\ndecoyed by the white wolf to this open space, when the animal appeared\nto slacken her speed. My father approached, came close up to her,\nraised his gun to his shoulder, and was about to fire; when the wolf\nsuddenly disappeared. He thought that the snow on the ground must have\ndazzled his sight, and he let down his gun to look for the beast--but\nshe was gone; how she could have escaped over the clearance, without\nhis seeing her, was beyond his comprehension. Mortified at the ill\nsuccess of his chase, he was about to retrace his steps, when he heard\nthe distant sound of a horn. Astonishment at such a sound--at such\nan hour--in such a wilderness, made him forget for the moment his\ndisappointment, and he remained riveted to the spot. In a minute the\nhorn was blown a second time, and at no great distance; my father\nstood still, and listened: a third time it was blown. I forget the\nterm used to express it, but it was the signal which, my father well\nknew, implied that the party was lost in the woods. In a few minutes\nmore my father beheld a man on horseback, with a female seated on the\ncrupper, enter the cleared space, and ride up to him. At first, my\nfather called to mind the strange stories which he had heard of the\nsupernatural beings who were said to frequent these mountains; but the\nnearer approach of the parties satisfied him that they were mortals\nlike himself. As soon as they came up to him, the man who guided the\nhorse accosted him. 'Friend Hunter, you are out late, the better\nfortune for us: we have ridden far, and are in fear of our lives,\nwhich are eagerly sought after. These mountains have enabled us to\nelude our pursuers; but if we find not shelter and refreshment, that\nwill avail us little, as we must perish from hunger and the inclemency\nof the night. My daughter, who rides behind me, is now more dead than\nalive,--say, can you assist us in our difficulty?'\n\n\"'My cottage is some few miles distant,' replied my father, 'but I\nhave little to offer you besides a shelter from the weather; to the\nlittle I have you are welcome. May I ask whence you come?'\n\n\"'Yes, friend, it is no secret now; we have escaped from Transylvania,\nwhere my daughter's honour and my life were equally in jeopardy!'\n\n\"This information was quite enough to raise an interest in my father's\nheart. He remembered his own escape: he remembered the loss of\nhis wife's honour, and the tragedy by which it was wound up. He\nimmediately, and warmly, offered all the assistance which he could\nafford them.\n\n\"'There is no time to be lost, then, good sir,' observed the horseman;\n'my daughter is chilled with the frost, and cannot hold out much\nlonger against the severity of the weather.'\n\n\"'Follow me,' replied my father, leading the way towards his home.\n\n\"'I was lured away in pursuit of a large white wolf,' observed my\nfather; 'it came to the very window of my hut, or I should not have\nbeen out at this time of night.'\n\n\"'The creature passed by us just as we came out of the wood,' said the\nfemale in a silvery tone.\n\n\"I was nearly discharging my piece at it,' observed the hunter; 'but\nsince it did us such good service, I am glad that I allowed it to\nescape.'\n\n\"In about an hour and a half, during which my father walked at a rapid\npace, the party arrived at the cottage, and, as I said before, came\nin.\n\n\"'We are in good time, apparently,' observed the dark hunter, catching\nthe smell of the roasted meat, as he walked to the fire and surveyed\nmy brother and sister, and myself. 'You have young cooks here,\nMynheer.' 'I am glad that we shall not have to wait,' replied my\nfather. 'Come, mistress, seat yourself by the fire; you require warmth\nafter your cold ride.' 'And where can I put up my horse, Mynheer?'\nobserved the huntsman.' 'I will take care of him,' replied my father,\ngoing out of the cottage door.\n\n\"The female must, however, be particularly described. She was young,\nand apparently twenty years of age. She was dressed in a travelling\ndress, deeply bordered with white fur, and wore a cap of white ermine\non her head. Her features were very beautiful, at least I thought so,\nand so my father has since declared. Her hair was flaxen, glossy and\nshining, and bright as a mirror; and her mouth, although somewhat\nlarge when it was open, showed the most brilliant teeth I have ever\nbeheld. But there was something about her eyes, bright as they were,\nwhich made us children afraid; they were so restless, so furtive; I\ncould not at that time tell why, but I felt as if there was cruelty in\nher eye; and when she beckoned us to come to her, we approached her\nwith fear and trembling. Still she was beautiful, very beautiful. She\nspoke kindly to my brother and myself, patted our heads, and caressed\nus; but Marcella would not come near her; on the contrary, she slunk\naway, and hid herself in the bed, and would not wait for the supper,\nwhich half an hour before she had been so anxious for.\n\n\"My father, having put the horse into a close shed, soon returned,\nand supper was placed upon the table. When it was over, my father\nrequested that the young lady would take possession of his bed, and\nhe would remain at the fire, and sit up with her father. After some\nhesitation on her part, this arrangement was agreed to, and I and my\nbrother crept into the other bed with Marcella, for we had as yet\nalways slept together.\n\n\"But we could not sleep; there was something so unusual, not only\nin seeing strange people, but in having those people sleep at the\ncottage, that we were bewildered. As for poor little Marcella, she was\nquiet, but I perceived that she trembled during the whole night, and\nsometimes I thought that she was checking a sob. My father had brought\nout some spirits, which he rarely used, and he and the strange hunter\nremained drinking and talking before the fire. Our ears were ready to\ncatch the slightest whisper--so much was our curiosity excited.\n\n\"'You said you came from Transylvania?' observed my father.\n\n\"'Even so, Mynheer,' replied the hunter. 'I was a serf to the noble\nhouse of ----; my master would insist upon my surrendering up my fair\ngirl to his wishes; it ended in my giving him a few inches of my\nhunting-knife.'\n\n\"'We are countrymen, and brothers in misfortune,' replied my father,\ntaking the huntsman's hand, and pressing it warmly.\n\n\"'Indeed! Are you, then, from that country?'\n\n\"'Yes; and I too have fled for my life. But mine is a melancholy\ntale.'\n\n\"'Your name?' inquired the hunter.\n\n\"'Krantz.'\n\n\"'What! Krantz of ---- I have heard your tale; you need not renew your\ngrief by repeating it now. Welcome, most welcome, Mynheer, and, I\nmay say, my worthy kinsman. I am your second cousin, Wilfred of\nBarnsdorf,' cried the hunter, rising up and embracing my father.\n\n\"They filled their horn mugs to the brim, and drank to one another,\nafter the German fashion. The conversation was then carried on in a\nlow tone; all that we could collect from it was, that our new relative\nand his daughter were to take up their abode in our cottage, at least\nfor the present. In about an hour they both fell back in their chairs,\nand appeared to sleep.\n\n\"'Marcella, dear, did you hear?' said my brother in a low tone.\n\n\"'Yes,' replied Marcella, in a whisper; 'I heard all. Oh! brother, I\ncannot bear to look upon that woman--I feel so frightened.'\n\n\"My brother made no reply, and shortly afterwards we were all three\nfast asleep.\n\n\"When we awoke the next morning, we found that the hunter's daughter\nhad risen before us. I thought she looked more beautiful than ever.\nShe came up to little Marcella and caressed her; the child burst into\ntears, and sobbed as if her heart would break.\n\n\"But, not to detain you with too long a story, the huntsman and his\ndaughter were accommodated in the cottage. My father and he went\nout hunting daily, leaving Christina with us. She performed all the\nhousehold duties; was very kind to us children; and, gradually, the\ndislike even of little Marcella wore away. But a great change took\nplace in my father; he appeared to have conquered his aversion to the\nsex, and was most attentive to Christina. Often, after her father and\nwe were in bed, would he sit up with her, conversing in a low tone by\nthe fire. I ought to have mentioned, that my father and the huntsman\nWilfred, slept in another portion of the cottage, and that the bed\nwhich he formerly occupied, and which was in the same room as ours,\nhad been given up to the use of Christina. These visitors had been\nabout three weeks at the cottage, when, one night, after we children\nhad been sent to bed, a consultation was held. My father had asked\nChristina in marriage, and had obtained both her own consent and that\nof Wilfred; after this a conversation took place, which was, as nearly\nas I can recollect, as follows:--\n\n\"'You may take my child, Mynheer Krantz, and my blessing with her,\nand I shall then leave you and seek some other habitation--it matters\nlittle where.'\n\n\"'Why not remain here, Wilfred?'\n\n\"'No, no, I am called elsewhere; let that suffice, and ask no more\nquestions. You have my child.'\n\n\"'I thank you for her, and will duly value her; but there is one\ndifficulty.'\n\n\"'I know what you would say; there is no priest here in this wild\ncountry: true; neither is there any law to bind; still must some\nceremony pass between you, to satisfy a father. Will you consent to\nmarry her after my fashion? if so, I will marry you directly.'\n\n\"'I will,' replied my father.\n\n\"'Then take her by the hand. Now, Mynheer, swear.'\n\n\"'I swear,' repeated my father.\n\n\"'By all the spirits of the Hartz Mountains--'\n\n\"'Nay, why not by Heaven?' interrupted my father.\n\n\"'Because it is not my humour,' rejoined Wilfred; 'if I prefer that\noath, less binding perhaps, than another, surely you will not thwart\nme.'\n\n\"'Well, be it so then; have your humour. Will you make me swear by\nthat in which I do not believe?'\n\n\"'Yet many do so, who in outward appearance are Christians,' rejoined\nWilfred; 'say, will you be married, or shall I take my daughter away\nwith me?'\n\n\"'Proceed,' replied my father, impatiently.\n\n\"'I swear by all the spirits of the Hartz Mountains, by all their\npower for good or for evil, that I take Christina for my wedded wife;\nthat I will ever protect her, cherish her, and love her; that my hand\nshall never be raised against her to harm her.'\n\n\"My father repeated the words after Wilfred.\n\n\"'And if I fail in this my vow, may all the vengeance of the spirits\nfall upon me and upon my children; may they perish by the vulture, by\nthe wolf, or other beasts of the forest; may their flesh be torn from\ntheir limbs, and their bones blanch in the wilderness; all this I\nswear.'\n\n\"My father hesitated, as he repeated the last words; little Marcella\ncould not restrain herself, and as my father repeated the last\nsentence, she burst into tears. This sudden interruption appeared to\ndiscompose the party, particularly my father; he spoke harshly to the\nchild, who controlled her sobs, burying her face under the bedclothes.\n\n\"Such was the second marriage of my father. The next morning, the\nhunter Wilfred mounted his horse, and rode away.\n\n\"My father resumed his bed, which was in the same room as ours; and\nthings went on much as before the marriage, except that our new\nmother-in-law did not show any kindness towards us; indeed, during\nmy father's absence, she would often beat us, particularly little\nMarcella, and her eyes would flash fire, as she looked eagerly upon\nthe fair and lovely child.\n\n\"One night, my sister awoke me and my brother.\n\n\"'What is the matter?' said Caesar.\n\n\"'She has gone out,' whispered Marcella.\n\n\"'Gone out!'\n\n\"'Yes, gone out at the door, in her night-clothes,' replied the child;\n'I saw her get out of bed, look at my father to see if he slept, and\nthen she went out at the door.'\n\n\"What could induce her to leave her bed, and all undressed to go out,\nin such bitter wintry weather, with the snow deep on the ground, was\nto us incomprehensible; we lay awake, and in about an hour we heard\nthe growl of a wolf, close under the window.\n\n\"'There is a wolf,' said Caesar; 'she will be torn to pieces.'\n\n\"'Oh, no!' cried Marcella.\n\n\"In a few minutes afterwards our mother-in-law appeared; she was in\nher night-dress, as Marcella had stated. She let down the latch of the\ndoor, so as to make no noise, went to a pail of water, and washed her\nface and hands, and then slipped into the bed where my father lay.\n\n\"We all three trembled, we hardly knew why, but we resolved to watch\nthe next night: we did so--and not only on the ensuing night, but\non many others, and always at about the same hour, would our\nmother-in-law rise from her bed, and leave the cottage--and after she\nwas gone, we invariably heard the growl of a wolf under our window,\nand always saw her, on her return, wash herself before she retired to\nbed. We observed, also, that she seldom sat down to meals, and that\nwhen she did, she appeared to eat with dislike; but when the meat was\ntaken down, to be prepared for dinner, she would often furtively put a\nraw piece into her mouth.\n\n\"My brother Caesar was a courageous boy; he did not like to speak to\nmy father until he knew more. He resolved that he would follow her\nout, and ascertain what she did. Marcella and I endeavoured to\ndissuade him from this project; but he would not be controlled, and,\nthe very next night he lay down in his clothes, and as soon as our\nmother-in-law had left the cottage, he jumped up, took down my\nfather's gun, and followed her.\n\n\"You may imagine in what a state of suspense Marcella and I remained,\nduring his absence. After a few minutes, we heard the report of a gun.\nIt did not awaken my father, and we lay trembling with anxiety. In\na minute afterwards we saw our mother-in-law enter the cottage--her\ndress was bloody. I put my hand to Marcella's mouth to prevent her\ncrying out, although I was myself in great alarm. Our mother-in-law\napproached my father's bed, looked to see if he was asleep, and then\nwent to the chimney, and blew up the embers into a blaze.\n\n\"'Who is there?' said my father, waking up.\n\n\"'Lie still, dearest,' replied my mother-in-law, 'it is only me; I\nhave lighted the fire to warm some water; I am not quite well.'\n\n\"My father turned round and was soon asleep; but we watched our\nmother-in-law. She changed her linen, and threw the garments she had\nworn into the fire; and we then perceived that her right leg was\nbleeding profusely, as if from a gun-shot wound. She bandaged it up,\nand then dressing herself, remained before the fire until the break of\nday.\n\n\"Poor little Marcella, her heart beat quick as she pressed me to her\nside--so indeed did mine. Where was our brother, Caesar? How did my\nmother-in-law receive the wound unless from his gun? At last my father\nrose, and then, for the first time I spoke, saying, 'Father, where is\nmy brother, Caesar?'\n\n\"'Your brother!' exclaimed he, 'why, where can he be?'\n\n\"'Merciful Heaven! I thought as I lay very restless last night,'\nobserved our mother-in-law, 'that I heard somebody open the latch of\nthe door; and, dear me, husband, what has become of your gun?'\n\n\"My father cast his eyes up above the chimney, and perceived that his\ngun was missing. For a moment he looked perplexed, then seizing a\nbroad axe, he went out of the cottage without saying another word.\n\n\"He did not remain away from us long: in a few minutes he returned,\nbearing in his arms the mangled body of my poor brother; he laid it\ndown, and covered up his face.\n\n\"My mother-in-law rose up, and looked at the body, while Marcella and\nI threw ourselves by its side wailing and sobbing bitterly.\n\n\"'Go to bed again, children,' said she sharply. 'Husband,' continued\nshe, 'your boy must have taken the gun down to shoot a wolf, and the\nanimal has been too powerful for him. Poor boy! he has paid dearly for\nhis rashness.'\n\n\"My father made no reply; I wished to speak--to tell all--but\nMarcella, who perceived my intention, held me by the arm, and looked\nat me so imploringly, that I desisted.\n\n\"My father, therefore, was left in his error; but Marcella and\nI, although we could not comprehend it, were conscious that our\nmother-in-law was in some way connected with my brother's death.\n\n\"That day my father went out and dug a grave, and when he laid the\nbody in the earth, he piled up stones over it, so that the wolves\nshould not be able to dig it up. The shock of this catastrophe was\nto my poor father very severe; for several days he never went to the\nchase, although at times he would utter bitter anathemas and vengeance\nagainst the wolves.\n\n\"But during this time of mourning on his part, my mother-in-law's\nnocturnal wanderings continued with the same regularity as before.\n\n\"At last, my father took down his gun, to repair to the forest; but he\nsoon returned, and appeared much annoyed.\n\n\"'Would you believe it, Christina, that the wolves--perdition to the\nwhole race--have actually contrived to dig up the body of my poor boy,\nand now there is nothing left of him but his bones?'\n\n\"'Indeed!' replied my mother-in-law. Marcella looked at me, and I saw\nin her intelligent eye all she would have uttered.\n\n\"'A wolf growls under our window every night, father,' said I.\n\n\"'Aye, indeed?--why did you not tell me, boy?--wake me the next time\nyou hear it.'\n\n\"I saw my mother-in-law turn away; her eyes flashed fire, and she\ngnashed her teeth.\n\n\"My father went out again, and covered up with a larger pile of stones\nthe little remnants of my poor brother which the wolves had spared.\nSuch was the first act of the tragedy.\n\n\"The spring now came on: the snow disappeared, and we were permitted\nto leave the cottage; but never would I quit, for one moment, my dear\nlittle sister, to whom, since the death of my brother, I was more\nardently attached than ever; indeed I was afraid to leave her alone\nwith my mother-in-law, who appeared to have a particular pleasure in\nill-treating the child. My father was now employed upon his little\nfarm, and I was able to render him some assistance.\n\n\"Marcella used to sit by us while we were at work, leaving my\nmother-in-law alone in the cottage. I ought to observe that, as the\nspring advanced, so did my mother-in-law decrease her nocturnal\nrambles, and that we never heard the growl of the wolf under the\nwindow after I had spoken of it to my father.\n\n\"One day, when my father and I were in the field, Marcella being with\nus, my mother-in-law came out, saying that she was going into the\nforest, to collect some herbs my father wanted, and that Marcella\nmust go to the cottage and watch the dinner. Marcella went, and my\nmother-in-law soon disappeared in the forest, taking a direction quite\ncontrary to that in which the cottage stood, and leaving my father and\nI, as it were, between her and Marcella.\n\n\"About an hour afterwards we were startled by shrieks from the\ncottage, evidently the shrieks of little Marcella. 'Marcella has burnt\nherself, father,' said I, throwing down my spade. My father threw down\nhis, and we both hastened to the cottage. Before we could gain the\ndoor, out darted a large white wolf, which fled with the utmost\ncelerity. My father had no weapon; he rushed into the cottage, and\nthere saw poor little Marcella expiring: her body was dreadfully\nmangled, and the blood pouring from it had formed a large pool on the\ncottage floor. My father's first intention had been to seize his gun\nand pursue, but he was checked by this horrid spectacle; he knelt down\nby his dying child, and burst into tears: Marcella could just look\nkindly on us for a few seconds, and then her eyes were closed in\ndeath.\n\n\"My father and I were still hanging over my poor sister's body, when\nmy mother-in-law came in. At the dreadful sight she expressed much\nconcern, but she did not appear to recoil from the sight of blood, as\nmost women do.\n\n\"'Poor child!' said she, 'it must have been that great white wolf\nwhich passed me just now, and frightened me so--she's quite dead,\nKrantz.'\n\n\"I know it--I know it!' cried my father in agony.\n\n\"I thought my father would never recover from the effects of this\nsecond tragedy: he mourned bitterly over the body of his sweet child,\nand for several days would not consign it to its grave, although\nfrequently requested by my mother-in-law to do so. At last he yielded,\nand dug a grave for her close by that of my poor brother, and took\nevery precaution that the wolves should not violate her remains.\n\n\"I was now really miserable, as I lay alone in the bed which I had\nformerly shared with my brother and sister. I could not help thinking\nthat my mother-in-law was implicated in both their deaths, although I\ncould not account for the manner; but I no longer felt afraid of her:\nmy little heart was full of hatred and revenge.\n\n\"The night after my sister had been buried, as I lay awake, I\nperceived my mother-in-law get up and go out of the cottage. I waited\nsome time, then dressed myself, and looked out through the door, which\nI half opened. The moon shone bright, and I could see the spot where\nmy brother and my sister had been buried; and what was my horror,\nwhen I perceived my mother-in-law busily removing the stones from\nMarcella's grave.\n\n\"She was in her white night-dress, and the moon shone full upon her.\nShe was digging with her hands, and throwing away the stones behind\nher with all the ferocity of a wild beast. It was some time before\nI could collect my senses and decide what I should do. At last, I\nperceived that she had arrived at the body, and raised it up to the\nside of the grave. I could bear it no longer; I ran to my father and\nawoke him.\n\n\"'Father! father!' cried I, 'dress yourself, and get your gun.'\n\n\"'What!' cried my father, 'the wolves are there, are they?'\n\n\"He jumped out of bed, threw on his clothes, and in his anxiety did\nnot appear to perceive the absence of his wife. As soon as he was\nready, I opened the door, he went out, and I followed him.\n\n\"Imagine his horror, when (unprepared as he was for such a sight) he\nbeheld, as he advanced towards the grave, not a wolf, but his wife, in\nher night-dress, on her hands and knees, crouching by the body of my\nsister, and tearing off large pieces of the flesh, and devouring them\nwith all the avidity of a wolf. She was too busy to be aware of our\napproach. My father dropped his gun, his hair stood on end; so did\nmine; he breathed heavily, and then his breath for a time stopped. I\npicked up the gun and put it into his hand. Suddenly he appeared as if\nconcentrated rage had restored him to double vigour; he levelled his\npiece, fired, and with a loud shriek, down fell the wretch whom he had\nfostered in his bosom.\n\n\"'God of Heaven!' cried my father, sinking down upon the earth in a\nswoon, as soon as he had discharged his gun.\n\n\"I remained some time by his side before he recovered. 'Where am I?'\nsaid he, 'what has happened?--Oh!--yes, yes! I recollect now. Heaven\nforgive me!'\n\n\"He rose and we walked up to the grave; what again was our\nastonishment and horror to find that instead of the dead body of my\nmother-in-law, as we expected, there was lying over the remains of my\npoor sister, a large, white she wolf.\n\n\"'The white wolf!' exclaimed my father, 'the white wolf which decoyed\nme into the forest--I see it all now--I have dealt with the spirits of\nthe Hartz Mountains.'\n\n\"For some time my father remained in silence and deep thought. He then\ncarefully lifted up the body of my sister, replaced it in the grave,\nand covered it over as before, having struck the head of the dead\nanimal with the heel of his boot, and raving like a madman. He walked\nback to the cottage, shut the door, and threw himself on the bed; I\ndid the same, for I was in a stupor of amazement.\n\n\"Early in the morning we were both roused by a loud knocking at the\ndoor, and in rushed the hunter Wilfred.\n\n\"'My daughter!--man--my daughter!--where is my daughter!' cried he in\na rage.\n\n\"'Where the wretch, the fiend, should be, I trust,' replied my father,\nstarting up and displaying equal choler; 'where she should be--in\nhell!--Leave this cottage or you may fare worse.'\n\n\"'Ha--ha!' replied the hunter, 'would you harm a potent spirit of the\nHartz Mountains. Poor mortal, who must needs wed a weir wolf.'\n\n\"'Out demon! I defy thee and thy power.'\n\n\"'Yet shall you feel it; remember your oath--your solemn oath--never\nto raise your hand against her to harm her.'\n\n\"'I made no compact with evil spirits.'\n\n\"'You did; and if you failed in your vow, you were to meet the\nvengeance of the spirits. Your children were to perish by the vulture,\nthe wolf--'\n\n\"'Out, out, demon!'\n\n\"'And their bones blanch in the wilderness. Ha!--ha!'\n\n\"My father, frantic with rage, seized his axe, and raised it over\nWilfred's head to strike.\n\n\"'All this I swear,' continued the huntsman, mockingly.\n\n\"The axe descended; but it passed through the form of the hunter, and\nmy father lost his balance, and fell heavily on the floor.\n\n\"'Mortal!' said the hunter, striding over my father's body, 'we have\npower over those only who have committed murder. You have been guilty\nof a double murder--you shall pay the penalty attached to your\nmarriage vow. Two of your children are gone; the third is yet to\nfollow--and follow them he will, for your oath is registered. Go--it\nwere kindness to kill thee--your punishment is--that you live!'\n\n\"With these words the spirit disappeared. My father rose from the\nfloor, embraced me tenderly, and knelt down in prayer.\n\n\"The next morning he quitted the cottage for ever. He took me with him\nand bent his steps to Holland, where we safely arrived. He had some\nlittle money with him; but he had not been many days in Amsterdam\nbefore he was seized with a brain fever, and died raving mad. I was\nput into the Asylum, and afterwards was sent to sea before the mast.\nYou now know all my history. The question is, whether I am to pay the\npenalty of my father's oath? I am myself perfectly convinced that, in\nsome way or another, I shall.\"\n\nOn the twenty-second day the high land of the south of Sumatra was in\nview; as there were no vessels in sight, they resolved to keep their\ncourse through the Straits, and run for Pulo Penang, which they\nexpected, as their vessel laid so close to the wind, to reach in seven\nor eight days. By constant exposure, Philip and Krantz were now so\nbronzed, that with their long beards and Mussulman dresses, they might\neasily have passed off for natives. They had steered during the whole\nof the days exposed to a burning sun; they had lain down and slept in\nthe dew of night, but their health had not suffered. But for several\ndays, since he had confided the history of his family to Philip,\nKrantz had become silent and melancholy; his usual flow of spirits had\nvanished, and Philip had often questioned him as to the cause. As they\nentered the Straits, Philip talked of what they should do upon their\narrival at Goa. When Krantz gravely replied, \"For some days, Philip, I\nhave had a presentiment that I shall never see that city.\"\n\n\"You are out of health, Krantz,\" replied Philip.\n\n\"No; I am in sound health, body and mind. I have endeavoured to shake\noff the presentiment, but in vain; there is a warning voice that\ncontinually tells me that I shall not be long with you. Philip, will\nyou oblige me by making me content on one point: I have gold about\nmy person which may be useful to you; oblige me by taking it, and\nsecuring it on your own.\"\n\n\"What nonsense, Krantz.\"\n\n\"It is no nonsense, Philip. Have you not had your warnings? Why should\nI not have mine? You know that I have little fear in my composition,\nand that I care not about death; but I feel the presentiment which I\nspeak of more strongly every hour. It is some kind spirit who would\nwarn me to prepare for another world. Be it so. I have lived long\nenough in this world to leave it without regret; although to part\nwith you and Amine, the only two now dear to me, is painful, I\nacknowledge.\"\n\n\"May not this arise from over-exertion and fatigue, Krantz? consider\nhow much excitement you have laboured under within these last four\nmonths. Is not that enough to create a corresponding depression?\nDepend upon it, my dear friend, such is the fact.\"\n\n\"I wish it were--but I feel otherwise, and there is a feeling of\ngladness connected with the idea that I am to leave this world,\narising from another presentiment, which equally occupies my mind.\"\n\n\"Which is?\"\n\n\"I hardly can tell you; but Amine and you are connected with it. In my\ndreams I have seen you meet again; but it has appeared to me, as if a\nportion of your trial was purposely shut from my sight in dark clouds;\nand I have asked, 'May not I see what is there concealed?'--and an\ninvisible has answered, 'No! 'twould make you wretched. Before these\ntrials take place, you will be summoned away'--and then I have thanked\nHeaven, and felt resigned.\"\n\n\"These are the imaginings of a disturbed brain, Krantz; that I am\ndestined to suffering may be true; but why Amine should suffer, or why\nyou, young, in full health and vigour, should not pass your days in\npeace, and live to a good old age, there is no cause for believing.\nYou will be better to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so,\" replied Krantz;--\"but still you must yield to my whim,\nand take the gold. If I am wrong, and we do arrive safe, you know,\nPhilip, you can let me have it back,\" observed Krantz, with a faint\nsmile--\"but you forget, our water is nearly out, and we must look out\nfor a rill on the coast to obtain a fresh supply.\"\n\n\"I was thinking of that when you commenced this unwelcome topic. We\nhad better look out for the water before dark, and as soon as we have\nreplenished our jars, we will make sail again.\"\n\nAt the time that this conversation took place, they were on the\neastern side of the Strait, about forty miles to the northward.\nThe interior of the coast was rocky and mountainous, but it slowly\ndescended to low land of alternate forest and jungles, which continued\nto the beach: the country appeared to be uninhabited. Keeping close in\nto the shore, they discovered, after two hours' run, a fresh stream\nwhich burst in a cascade from the mountains, and swept its devious\ncourse through the jungle, until it poured its tribute into the waters\nof the Strait.\n\nThey ran close in to the mouth of the stream, lowered the sails, and\npulled the peroqua against the current, until they had advanced far\nenough to assure them that the water was quite fresh. The jars were\nsoon filled, and they were again thinking of pushing off; when,\nenticed by the beauty of the spot, the coolness of the fresh water,\nand wearied with their long confinement on board of the peroqua, they\nproposed to bathe--a luxury hardly to be appreciated by those who\nhave not been in a similar situation. They threw off their Mussulman\ndresses, and plunged into the stream, where they remained for some\ntime. Krantz was the first to get out; he complained of feeling\nchilled, and he walked on to the banks where their clothes had been\nlaid. Philip also approached nearer to the beach, intending to follow\nhim.\n\n\"And now, Philip,\" said Krantz, \"this will be a good opportunity for\nme to give you the money. I will open my sash, and pour it out, and\nyou can put it into your own before you put it on.\"\n\nPhilip was standing in the water, which was about level with his\nwaist.\n\n\"Well, Krantz,\" said he, \"I suppose if it must be so, it must; but it\nappears to me an idea so ridiculous--however, you shall have your own\nway.\"\n\nPhilip quitted the run, and sat down by Krantz, who was already busy\nin shaking the doubloons out of the folds of his sash; at last he\nsaid--\n\n\"I believe, Philip, you have got them all, now?--I feel satisfied.\"\n\n\"What danger there can be to you, which I am not equally exposed to, I\ncannot conceive,\" replied Philip; \"however--\"\n\nHardly had he said these words, when there was a tremendous roar--a\nrush like a mighty wind through the air--a blow which threw him on\nhis back--a loud cry--and a contention. Philip recovered himself, and\nperceived the naked form of Krantz carried off with the speed of\nan arrow by an enormous tiger through the jungle. He watched with\ndistended eyeballs; in a few seconds the animal and Krantz had\ndisappeared!\n\n\"God of Heaven! would that Thou hadst spared me this,\" cried Philip,\nthrowing himself down in agony on his face. \"Oh! Krantz, my friend--my\nbrother--too sure was your presentiment. Merciful God! have pity--but\nThy will be done;\" and Philip burst into a flood of tears.\n\nFor more than an hour did he remain fixed upon the spot, careless\nand indifferent to the danger by which he was surrounded. At last,\nsomewhat recovered, he rose, dressed himself, and then again sat\ndown--his eyes fixed upon the clothes of Krantz, and the gold which\nstill lay on the sand.\n\n\"He would give me that gold. He foretold his doom. Yes! yes! it was\nhis destiny, and it has been fulfilled. _His bones will bleach in\nthe wilderness_, and the spirit-hunter and his wolfish daughter are\navenged.\"\n\nThe shades of evening now set in, and the low growling of the beasts\nof the forest recalled Philip to a sense of his own danger. He thought\nof Amine; and hastily making the clothes of Krantz and the doubloons\ninto a package, he stepped into the peroqua, with difficulty shoved it\noff, and with a melancholy heart, and in silence, hoisted the sail,\nand pursued his course.\n\n\"Yes, Amine,\" thought Philip, as he watched the stars twinkling and\ncorruscating. \"Yes, you are right, when you assert that the destinies\nof men are foreknown, and may by some be read. My destiny is, alas!\nthat I should be severed from all I value upon earth, and die\nfriendless and alone. Then welcome death, if such is to be the case;\nwelcome a thousand welcomes! what a relief wilt thou be to me! what\njoy to find myself summoned to where the weary are at rest! I have my\ntask to fulfil. God grant that it may soon be accomplished, and let\nnot my life be embittered by any more trials such as this.\"\n\nAgain did Philip weep, for Krantz had been his long-tried, valued\nfriend, his partner in all his dangers and privations, from the period\nthat they had met when the Dutch fleet attempted the passage round\nCape Horn.\n\nAfter seven days of painful watching and brooding over bitter\nthoughts, Philip arrived at Pulo Penang, where he found a vessel about\nto sail for the city to which he was destined. He ran his peroqua\nalongside of her, and found that she was a brig under the Portuguese\nflag, having, however, but two Portuguese on board, the rest of the\ncrew being natives. Representing himself as an Englishman in the\nPortuguese service, who had been wrecked, and offering to pay for\nhis passage, he was willingly received, and in a few days the vessel\nsailed.\n\nTheir voyage was prosperous; in six weeks they anchored in the roads\nof Goa; the next day they went up the river. The Portuguese captain\ninformed Philip where he might obtain lodging; and passing him off as\none of his crew, there was no difficulty raised as to his landing.\nHaving located himself at his new lodging, Philip commenced some\ninquiries of his host relative to Amine, designating her merely as a\nyoung woman who had arrived there in a vessel some weeks before; but\nhe could obtain no information concerning her. \"Signor,\" said the\nhost, \"to-morrow is the grand _Auto da Fé_; we can do nothing until\nthat is over; afterwards, I will put you in the way to find out what\nyou wish. In the meantime, you can walk about the town; to-morrow I\nwill take you to where you can behold the grand procession, and then\nwe will try what we can do to assist you in your search.\"\n\nPhilip went out, procured a suit of clothes, removed his beard, and\nthen walked about the town, looking up at every window to see if he\ncould perceive Amine. At a corner of one of the streets, he thought he\nrecognised Father Mathias, and ran up to him; but the monk had drawn\nhis cowl over his head, and when addressed by that name, made no\nreply.\n\n\"I was deceived,\" thought Philip; \"but I really thought it was him.\"\nAnd Philip was right; it was Father Mathias, who thus screened himself\nfrom Philip's recognition.\n\nTired, at last he returned to his hotel, just before it was dark. The\ncompany there were numerous; everybody for miles distant had come to\nGoa to witness the _Auto da Fé_,--and everybody was discussing the\nceremony.\n\n\"I will see this grand procession,\" said Philip to himself, as he\nthrew himself on his bed. \"It will drive thought from me for a time,\nand God knows how painful my thoughts have now become. Amine, dear\nAmine, may angels guard thee!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter XL\n\n\nAlthough to-morrow was to end all Amine's hopes and fears--all her\nshort happiness--her suspense and misery--yet Amine slept until\nher last slumber in this world was disturbed by the unlocking and\nunbarring of the doors of her cell, and the appearance of the head\njailor with a light. Amine started up--she had been dreaming of her\nhusband--of happiness! She awoke to the sad reality. There stood the\njailor, with a dress in his hand, which he desired she would put on.\nHe lighted a lamp for her, and left her alone. The dress was of black\nserge, with white stripes.\n\nAmine put on the dress, and threw herself down on the bed, trying if\npossible to recall the dream from which she had been awakened, but\nin vain. Two hours passed away, and the jailor again entered, and\nsummoned her to follow him. Perhaps one of the most appalling customs\nof the Inquisition is, that after accusation, whether the accused\nparties confess their guilt or not, they return to their dungeons,\nwithout the least idea of what may have been their sentence, and when\nsummoned on the morning of the execution they are equally kept in\nignorance.\n\nThe prisoners were all summoned by the jailors, from the various\ndungeons, and led into a large hall, where they found their\nfellow-sufferers collected.\n\nIn this spacious, dimly lighted hall were to be seen about two hundred\nmen, standing up as if for support, against the walls, all dressed in\nthe same black and white serge; so motionless, so terrified were they,\nthat if it had not been for the rolling of their eyes, as they watched\nthe jailors, who passed and repassed, you might have imagined them to\nbe petrified. It was the agony of suspense, worse than the agony of\ndeath. After a time, a wax candle, about five feet long, was put into\nthe hands of each prisoner, and then some were ordered to put on\nover their dress the _Sanbenitos_--others the _Samarias_! Those who\nreceived these dresses, with flames painted on them, gave themselves\nup for lost; and it was dreadful to perceive the anguish of each\nindividual as the dresses were one by one brought forward, and with\nthe heavy drops of perspiration on his brows, he watched with terror\nlest one should be presented to him. All was doubt, fear, and horror!\n\nBut the prisoners in this hall were not those who were to suffer\ndeath. Those who wore the Sanbenitos had to walk in the procession and\nreceive but slight punishment; those who wore the Samarias had\nbeen condemned, but had been saved from the consuming fire, by an\nacknowledgment of their offence; the flames painted on their dresses\nwere _reversed_, and signified that they were not to suffer; but this\nthe unfortunate wretches did not know, and the horrors of a cruel\ndeath stared them in the face!\n\nAnother hall, similar to the one in which the men had been\ncollected, was occupied by female culprits. The same ceremonies were\nobserved--the same doubt, fear, and agony were depicted upon every\ncountenance. But there was a third chamber, smaller than the other\ntwo, and this chamber was reserved for those who had been sentenced,\nand who were to suffer at the stake. It was into this chamber that\nAmine was led, and there she found seven other prisoners dressed in\nthe same manner as herself: two only were Europeans, the other five\nwere negro slaves. Each of these had their confessor with them, and\nwere earnestly listening to his exhortation. A monk approached Amine,\nbut she waved him away with her hand: he looked at her, spat on the\nfloor, and cursed her. The head jailor now made his appearance with\nthe dresses for those who were in this chamber; these were Samarias,\nonly different from the others, inasmuch as the flames were painted on\nthem _upwards_ instead of down. These dresses were of grey stuff, and\nloose, like a waggoner's frock; at the lower part of them, both before\nand behind, was painted the likeness of the wearer, that is, the face\nonly, resting upon a burning faggot, and surrounded with flames and\ndemons. Under the portrait was written the crime for which the party\nsuffered. Sugar-loaf caps, with flames painted on them, were also\nbrought and put on their heads, and the long wax candles were placed\ninto their hands.\n\nAmine and the others condemned being arrayed in these dresses,\nremained in the chambers, for some hours before it was time for the\nprocession to commence, for they had been all summoned up by the\njailors at about two o'clock in the morning.\n\nThe sun rose brilliantly, much to the joy of the members of the Holy\nOffice, who would not have had the day obscured on which they were to\nvindicate the honour of the church, and prove how well they acted up\nto the mild doctrines of the Saviour--those of charity, good-will,\nforbearing one another, forgiving one another. God of Heaven! And not\nonly did those of the Holy Inquisition rejoice, but thousands and\nthousands more who had flocked from all parts to witness the dreadful\nceremony, and to hold a jubilee--many indeed actuated by fanaticism,\nsuperstition, but more attended from thoughtlessness and the love of\npageantry. The streets and squares through which the procession was\nto pass were filled at an early hour. Silks, tapestries, and cloth of\ngold and silver were hung over the balconies, and out of the windows,\nin honour of the procession. Every balcony and window was thronged\nwith ladies and cavaliers in their gayest attire, all waiting\nanxiously to see the wretches paraded before they suffered; but the\nworld is fond of excitement, and where is anything so exciting to a\nsuperstitious people as an _Auto da Fé_?\n\nAs the sun rose, the heavy bell of the Cathedral tolled, and all the\nprisoners were led down to the Grand Hall, that the order of the\nprocession might be arranged. At the large entrance door, on a raised\nthrone, sat the Grand Inquisitor, encircled by many of the most\nconsiderable nobility and gentry of Goa. By the Grand Inquisitor stood\nhis Secretary, and as the prisoners walked past the throne, and their\nnames were mentioned, the Secretary, after each, called out the names\nof one of those gentlemen, who immediately stepped forward, and took\nhis station by the prisoner. These people are termed the godfathers;\ntheir duty is to accompany and be answerable for the prisoner, who is\nunder their charge, until the ceremony is over. It is reckoned a high\nhonour conferred on those whom the Grand Inquisitor appoints to this\noffice.\n\nAt last the procession commenced. First was raised on high the\nstandard of the Dominican Order of Monks, for the Dominican Order\nwere the founders of the Inquisition, and claimed this privilege, by\nprescriptive right. After the banner the monks themselves followed,\nin two lines. And what was the motto of their banner? \"Justitia et\nMisericordia!\" Then followed the culprits, to the number of three\nhundred, each with his godfather by his side, and his large wax candle\nlighted in his hand. Those whose offences have been most venial walk\nfirst; all are bareheaded, and barefooted. After this portion, who\nwore only the dress of black and white serge, came those who carried\nthe Sanbenitos; then those who wore the Samarias, with the flames\nreversed. Here there was a separation in the procession, caused by a\nlarge cross, with the carved image of Our Saviour nailed to it, the\nface of the image carried forward. This was intended to signify, that\nthose in advance of the Crucifix, and upon whom the Saviour looked\ndown, were not to suffer; and that those who were behind, and upon\nwhom his back was turned, were cast away, to perish for ever in this\nworld, and the next. Behind the Crucifix followed the seven condemned;\nand, as the greatest criminal, Amine walked the last. But the\nprocession did not close here. Behind Amine were five effigies, raised\nhigh on poles, clothed in the same dresses, painted with flames and\ndemons. Behind each effigy was borne a coffin, containing a skeleton;\nthe effigies were of those who had died in their dungeon, or expired\nunder the torture, and who had been tried and condemned after their\ndeath, and sentenced to be burnt. These skeletons had been dug up,\nand were to suffer the same sentence as, had they still been living\nbeings, they would have undergone. The effigies were to be tied to the\nstakes, and the bones were to be consumed. Then followed the members\nof the Inquisition; the familiars, monks, priests, and hundreds of\npenitents, in black dresses, which concealed their faces, all with the\nlighted tapers in their hands.\n\nIt was two hours before the procession, which had paraded through\nalmost every important street in Goa, arrived at the Cathedral in\nwhich the further ceremonies were to be gone through. The barefooted\nculprits could now scarcely walk, the small sharp flints having so\nwounded their feet, that their tracks up the steps of the Cathedral\nwere marked with blood.\n\nThe grand altar of the Cathedral was hung with black cloth, and\nlighted up with thousands of tapers. On one side of it was a throne\nfor the Grand Inquisitor, on the other, a raised platform for the\nViceroy of Goa, and his suite. The centre aisle had benches for the\nprisoners, and their godfathers; the other portions of the procession\nfalling off to the right and left, to the side aisles, and mixing for\nthe time with the spectators. As the prisoners entered the Cathedral,\nthey were led into their seats, those least guilty sitting nearest to\nthe altar, and those who were condemned to suffer at the stake being\nplaced the farthest from it.\n\nThe bleeding Amine tottered to her seat, and longed for the hour which\nwas to sever her from a Christian world. She thought not of herself,\nnor of what she was to suffer; she thought but of Philip; of his being\nsafe from these merciless creatures--of the happiness of dying first,\nand of meeting him again in bliss.\n\nWorn with long confinement, with suspense and anxiety, fatigued and\nsuffering from her painful walk, and the exposure to the burning sun,\nafter so many months' incarceration in a dungeon, she no longer shone\nradiant with beauty; but still there was something even more touching\nin her care-worn, yet still perfect features. The object of universal\ngaze, she had walked with her eyes cast down, and nearly closed; but\noccasionally, when she did look up, the fire that flashed from them\nspoke the proud soul within, and many feared and wondered, while more\npitied that one so young, and still so lovely, should be doomed to\nsuch an awful fate. Amine had not taken her seat in the Cathedral more\nthan a few seconds, when, overpowered by her feelings and by fatigue,\nshe fell back in a swoon.\n\nDid no one step forward to assist her? to raise her up, and offer her\nrestoratives? No--not one. Hundreds would have done so, but they dared\nnot: she was an outcast, excommunicated, abandoned, and lost; and\nshould any one, moved by compassion for a suffering fellow-creature,\nhave ventured to raise her up, he would have been looked upon with\nsuspicion, and most probably have been arraigned, and have had to\nsettle the affair of conscience with the Holy Inquisition.\n\nAfter a short time two of the officers of the Inquisition went to\nAmine and raised her again in her seat, and she recovered sufficiently\nto enable her to retain her posture.\n\nA sermon was then preached by a Dominican monk, in which he pourtrayed\nthe tender mercies, the paternal love of the Holy Office. He compared\nthe Inquisition to the ark of Noah, out of which all the animals\nwalked after the deluge; but with this difference, highly in favour of\nthe Holy Office, that the animals went forth from the ark no better\nthan they went in, whereas those who had gone into the Inquisition\nwith all the cruelty of disposition, and with the hearts of wolves,\ncame out as mild and patient as lambs.\n\nThe public accuser then mounted the pulpit, and read from it all the\ncrimes of those who had been condemned, and the punishments which they\nwere to undergo. Each prisoner, as the sentence was read, was brought\nforward to the pulpit by the officers, to hear their sentence,\nstanding up, with their wax candles lighted in their hands. As soon as\nthe sentences of all those whose lives had been spared were read, the\nGrand Inquisitor put on his priestly robes and, followed by several\nothers, took off from them the ban of excommunication (which they were\nsupposed to have fallen under), by throwing holy water on them with a\nsmall broom.\n\nAs soon as this portion of the ceremony was over, those who were\ncondemned to suffer, and the effigies of those who had escaped by\ndeath, were brought up one by one, and their sentences read; the\nwinding up of the condemnation of all was in the same words, \"that the\nHoly Inquisition found it impossible on account of the hardness of\ntheir hearts and the magnitude of their crimes, to pardon them. With\ngreat concern it handed them over to Secular Justice to undergo the\npenalty of the laws; exhorting the authorities at the same time to\nshow clemency and mercy towards the unhappy wretches, and if they\n_must_ suffer death, that at all events it might be without the\n_spilling of blood_.\" What mockery was this apparent intercession, not\nto shed blood, when to comply with their request, they substituted the\ntorment and the agony of the stake!\n\nAmine was the last who was led forward to the pulpit, which was fixed\nagainst one of the massive columns of the centre aisle, close to the\nthrone occupied by the Grand Inquisitor. \"You, Amine Vanderdecken,\"\ncried the public accuser. At this moment an unusual bustle was heard\nin the crowd under the pulpit, there was struggling and expostulation,\nand the officers raised their wands for silence and decorum--but it\ncontinued.\n\n\"You, Amine Vanderdecken, being accused--\"\n\nAnother violent struggle; and from the crowd darted a young man, who\nrushed to where Amine was standing, and caught her in his arms.\n\n\"Philip! Philip!\" screamed Amine, falling on his bosom; as he caught\nher, the cap of flames fell off her head and rolled along the marble\npavement. \"My Amine--my wife--my adored one--is it thus we meet? My\nlord, she is innocent. Stand off, men,\" continued he to the officers\nof the Inquisition, who would have torn them asunder. \"Stand off, or\nyour lives shall answer for it.\"\n\nThis threat to the officers, and the defiance of all rules, were not\nto be borne; the whole Cathedral was in a state of commotion, and the\nsolemnity of the ceremony was about to be compromised. The Viceroy and\nhis followers had risen from their chairs to observe what was passing,\nand the crowd was pressing on, when the Grand Inquisitor gave his\ndirections, and other officers hastened to the assistance of the\ntwo who had led Amine forward, and proceeded to disengage her from\nPhilip's arms. The struggle was severe. Philip appeared to be endued\nwith the strength of twenty men; and it was some minutes before they\ncould succeed in separating him, and when they had so done, his\nstruggles were dreadful.\n\nAmine, also, held by two of the familiars, shrieked, as she attempted\nonce more, but in vain, to rush into her husband's arms. At last, by\na tremendous effort, Philip released himself, but as soon as he was\nreleased, he sank down helpless on the pavement; the exertion had\ncaused the bursting of a blood-vessel, and he lay without motion.\n\n\"Oh God! Oh God! they have killed him--monsters--murderers--let me\nembrace him but once more,\" cried Amine, frantically.\n\nA priest now stepped forward--it was Father Mathias--with sorrow in\nhis countenance; he desired some of the bystanders to carry out Philip\nVanderdecken, and Philip, in a state of insensibility, was borne away\nfrom the sight of Amine, the blood streaming from his mouth.\n\nAmine's sentence was read--she heard it not, her brain was bewildered.\nShe was led back to her seat, and then it was that all her courage,\nall her constancy and fortitude gave way; and during the remainder\nof the ceremony, she filled the Cathedral with her wild hysterical\nsobbing; all entreaties or threats being wholly lost upon her.\n\nAll was now over, except the last and most tragical scene of the\ndrama. The culprits who had been spared were led back to the\nInquisition by their godfathers, and those who had been sentenced were\ntaken down to the banks of the river to suffer. It was on a large open\nspace, on the left of the Custom-house, that this ceremony was to be\ngone through. As in the Cathedral, raised thrones were prepared for\nthe Grand Inquisitor and the Viceroy, who, in state, headed the\nprocession, followed by an immense concourse of people. Thirteen\nstakes had been set up, eight for the living, five for the dead. The\nexecutioners were sitting on, or standing by, the piles of wood and\nfaggots, waiting for their victims. Amine could not walk; she was at\nfirst supported by the familiars, and then carried by them, to the\nstake which had been assigned for her. When they put her on her feet\nopposite to it, her courage appeared to revive, she walked boldly up,\nfolded her arms, and leant against it.\n\nThe executioners now commenced their office: the chains were passed\nround Amine's body--the wood and faggots piled around her. The same\npreparations had been made with all the other culprits, and the\nconfessors stood by the side of each victim. Amine waved her hand\nindignantly to those who approached her, when Father Mathias, almost\nbreathless, made his appearance from the crowd, through which he had\nforced his way.\n\n\"Amine Vanderdecken--unhappy woman! had you been counselled by me this\nwould not have been. Now it is too late, but not too late to save your\nsoul. Away then with this obstinacy--this hardness of heart; call upon\nthe blessed Saviour, that He may receive your spirit--call upon His\nwounds for mercy. It is the eleventh hour, but not too late. Amine,\"\ncontinued the old man, with tears, \"I implore, I conjure you. At\nleast, may this load of trouble be taken from my heart.\"\n\n\"'Unhappy woman!' you say?\" replied she, \"say rather, 'unhappy\npriest:' for Amine's sufferings will soon be over, while you must\nstill endure the torments of the damned. Unhappy was the day when my\nhusband rescued you from death. Still more unhappy the compassion\nwhich prompted him to offer you an asylum and a refuge. Unhappy the\nknowledge of you from the _first_ day to the _last_. I leave you to\nyour conscience--if conscience you retain--nor would I change this\ncruel death for the pangs which you in your future life will suffer.\nLeave me--_I die in the faith of my forefathers_, and scorn a creed\nthat warrants such a scene as this.\"\n\n\"Amine Vanderdecken,\" cried the priest on his knees, clasping his\nhands in agony.\n\n\"Leave me, Father.\"\n\n\"There is but a minute left--for the love of God--\"\n\n\"I tell you then, leave me--that minute is my own.\"\n\nFather Mathias turned away in despair, and the tears coursed down the\nold man's cheeks. As Amine said, his misery was extreme.\n\nThe head executioner now inquired of the confessors whether the\nculprits died in the _true_ faith? If answered in the affirmative, a\nrope was passed round their necks and twisted to the stake, so that\nthey were strangled before the fire was kindled. All the other\nculprits had died in this manner; and the head executioner inquired of\nFather Mathias, whether Amine had a claim to so much mercy. The old\npriest answered not, but shook his head.\n\nThe executioner turned away. After a moment's pause, Father Mathias\nfollowed him, and seized him by the arm, saying, in a faltering voice,\n\"Let her not suffer long.\"\n\nThe Grand Inquisitor gave the signal, and the fires were all lighted\nat the same moment. In compliance with the request of the priest, the\nexecutioner had thrown a quantity of wet straw upon Amine's pile,\nwhich threw up a dense smoke before it burnt into flames.\n\n\"Mother! mother! I come to thee!\" were the last words heard from\nAmine's lips.\n\nThe flames soon raged furiously, ascending high above the top of the\nstake to which she had been chained. Gradually they sunk down; and\nonly when the burning embers covered the ground, a few fragments of\nbones hanging on the chain were all that remained of the once peerless\nand high-minded Amine.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XLI\n\n\nYears have passed away since we related Amine's sufferings and cruel\ndeath; and now once more we bring Philip Vanderdecken on the scene.\nAnd during this time, where has he been? A lunatic--at one time\nfrantic, chained, coerced with blows; at others, mild and peaceable.\nReason occasionally appeared to burst out again, as the sun on a\ncloudy day, and then it was again obscured. For many years there was\none who watched him carefully, and lived in hope to witness his return\nto a sane mind; he watched in sorrow and remorse,--he died without his\ndesires being gratified. This was Father Mathias!\n\nThe cottage at Terneuse had long fallen into ruin; for many years it\nwaited the return of its owners, and at last the heirs-at-law claimed\nand recovered the substance of Philip Vanderdecken. Even the fate of\nAmine had passed from the recollection of most people; although her\nportrait, over burning coals, with her crime announced beneath it, still\nhangs--as is the custom in the church of the Inquisition--attracting,\nfrom its expressive beauty, the attention of the most careless\npassers-by.\n\nBut many, many years have rolled away--Philip's hair is white--his\nonce-powerful frame is broken down--and he appears much older than he\nreally is. He is now sane; but his vigour is gone. Weary of life, all\nhe wishes for is to execute his mission--and then to welcome death.\n\nThe relic has never been taken from him: he has been discharged from\nthe lunatic asylum, and has been provided with the means of returning\nto his country. Alas! he has now no country--no home--nothing in the\nworld to induce him to remain in it. All he asks is--to do his duty\nand to die.\n\nThe ship was ready to sail for Europe; and Philip Vanderdecken went on\nboard--hardly caring whither he went. To return to Terneuse was not\nhis object; he could not bear the idea of revisiting the scene of so\nmuch happiness and so much misery. Amine's form was engraven on his\nheart, and he looked forward with impatience to the time when he\nshould be summoned to join her in the land of spirits.\n\nHe had awakened as from a dream, after so many years of aberration of\nintellect. He was no longer the sincere Catholic that he had been;\nfor he never thought of religion without his Amine's cruel fate being\nbrought to his recollection. Still he clung on to the relic--he\nbelieved in that--and that only. It was his god--his creed--his\neverything--the passport for himself and for his father into the next\nworld--the means whereby he should join his Amine--and for hours would\nhe remain holding in his hand that object so valued--gazing upon\nit--recalling every important event in his life, from the death of his\npoor mother, and his first sight of Amine; to the last dreadful scene.\nIt was to him a journal of his existence, and on it were fixed all his\nhopes for the future.\n\n\"When! oh when is it to be accomplished!\" was the constant subject\nof his reveries. \"Blessed, indeed, will be the day when I leave this\nworld of hate, and seek that other in which 'the weary are at rest.'\"\n\nThe vessel on board of which Philip was embarked as a passenger was\nthe _Nostra Señora da Monte_, a brig of three hundred tons, bound for\nLisbon. The captain was an old Portuguese, full of superstition, and\nfond of arrack--a fondness rather unusual with the people of his\nnation. They sailed from Goa, and Philip was standing abaft, and sadly\ncontemplating the spire of the Cathedral, in which he had last parted\nwith his wife, when his elbow was touched, and he turned round.\n\n\"Fellow-passenger, again!\" said a well-known voice--it was that of the\npilot Schriften.\n\nThere was no alteration in the man's appearance; he showed no marks of\ndeclining years; his one eye glared as keenly as ever.\n\nPhilip started, not only at the sight of the man, but at the\nreminiscences which his unexpected appearance brought to his mind. It\nwas but for a second, and he was again calm and pensive.\n\n\"You here again, Schriften?\" observed Philip. \"I trust your appearance\nforebodes the accomplishment of my task.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it does,\" replied the pilot; \"we both are weary.\"\n\nPhilip made no reply; he did not even ask Schriften in what manner he\nhad escaped from the fort; he was indifferent about it; for he felt\nthat the man had a charmed life.\n\n\"Many are the vessels that have been wrecked, Philip Vanderdecken, and\nmany the souls summoned to their account by meeting with your father's\nship, while you have been so long shut up,\" observed the pilot.\n\n\"May our next meeting with him be more fortunate--may it be the last!\"\nreplied Philip.\n\n\"No, no! rather may he fulfil his doom, and sail till the day of\njudgment,\" replied the pilot with emphasis.\n\n\"Vile caitiff! I have a foreboding that you will not have your\ndetestable wish. Away!--leave me! or you shall find, that although\nthis head is blanched by misery, this arm has still some power.\"\n\nSchriften scowled as he walked away; he appeared to have some fear\nof Philip, although it was not equal to his hate. He now resumed his\nformer attempts of stirring up the ship's company against Philip,\ndeclaring that he was a Jonas, who would occasion the loss of the\nship, and that he was connected with the _Flying Dutchman_.\nPhilip very soon observed that he was avoided; and he resorted to\ncounter-statements, equally injurious to Schriften, whom he declared\nto be a demon. The appearance of Schriften was so much against him,\nwhile that of Philip, on the contrary, was so prepossessing, that the\npeople on board hardly knew what to think. They were divided: some\nwere on the side of Philip--some on that of Schriften; the captain and\nmany others looking with equal horror upon both, and longing for the\ntime when they could be sent out of the vessel.\n\nThe captain, as we have before observed, was very superstitious, and\nvery fond of his bottle. In the morning he would be sober and pray; in\nthe afternoon he would be drunk, and swear at the very saints whose\nprotection he had invoked but a few hours before.\n\n\"May Holy Saint Antonio preserve us, and keep us from temptation,\"\nsaid he, on the morning after a conversation with the passengers about\nthe Phantom Ship. \"All the saints protect us from harm,\" continued he,\ntaking off his hat reverentially, and crossing himself. \"Let me but\nrid myself of these two dangerous men without accident, and I will\noffer up a hundred wax candles, of three ounces each, to the shrine\nof the Virgin, upon my safe anchoring off the tower of Belem.\" In the\nevening he changed his language.\n\n\"Now, if that Maldetto Saint Antonio don't help us, may he feel the\ncoals of hell yet; damn him and his pigs too; if he has the courage to\ndo his duty, all will be well; but he is a cowardly wretch, he cares\nfor nobody, and will not help those who call upon him in trouble.\nCarambo! that for you,\" exclaimed the captain, looking at the small\nshrine of the saint at the bittacle, and snapping his fingers at the\nimage--\"that for you, you useless wretch, who never help us in our\ntrouble. The Pope must canonise some better saints for us, for all we\nhave now are worn out. They could do something formerly, but now I\nwould not give two ounces of gold for the whole calendar; as for you,\nyou lazy old scoundrel,\"--continued the captain, shaking his fist at\npoor Saint Antonio.\n\nThe ship had now gained off the southern coast of Africa, and was\nabout one hundred miles from the Lagullas coast; the morning was\nbeautiful, a slight ripple only turned over the waves, the breeze was\nlight and steady, and the vessel was standing on a wind, at the rate\nof about four miles an hour.\n\n\"Blessed be the holy saints,\" said the captain, who had just gained\nthe deck; \"another little slant in our favour, and we shall lay our\ncourse.--Again I say, blessed be the holy saints, and particularly\nour worthy patron Saint Antonio, who has taken under his peculiar\nprotection the _Nostra Señora da Monte_. We have a prospect of fine\nweather; come, signors, let us down to breakfast, and after breakfast\nwe will enjoy our cigarros upon the deck.\"\n\nBut the scene was soon changed; a bank of clouds rose up from the\neastward, with a rapidity that, to the seamen's eyes, was unnatural,\nand it soon covered the whole firmament; the sun was obscured, and all\nwas one deep and unnatural gloom; the wind subsided, and the ocean was\nhushed. It was not exactly dark, but the heavens were covered with one\nred haze, which gave an appearance as if the world was in a state of\nconflagration.\n\nIn the cabin the increased darkness was first observed by Philip, who\nwent on deck; he was followed by the captain and passengers, who were\nin a state of amazement. It was unnatural and incomprehensible. \"Now,\nholy Virgin, protect us--what can this be?\" exclaimed the captain in a\nfright. \"Holy Saint Antonio, protect us--but this is awful.\"\n\n\"There! there!\" shouted the sailors, pointing to the beam of the\nvessel. Every eye looked over the gunnel to witness what had\noccasioned such exclamations. Philip, Schriften, and the captain were\nside by side. On the beam of the ship, not more than two cables'\nlength distant, they beheld, slowly rising out of the water, the\ntapering mast-head and spars of another vessel. She rose, and rose\ngradually; her topmasts and top-sail yards, with the sails set, next\nmade their appearance; higher and higher she rose up from the element.\nHer lower masts and rigging, and, lastly, her hull showed itself above\nthe surface. Still she rose up till her ports, with her guns, and at\nlast the whole of her floatage was above water, and there she remained\nclose to them, with her main-yard squared, and hove-to.\n\n\"Holy Virgin!\" exclaimed the captain, breathless; \"I have known ships\nto _go down_, but never to _come up_ before. Now will I give one\nthousand candles, of ten ounces each, to the shrine of the Virgin to\nsave us in this trouble. One thousand wax candles! Hear me, blessed\nlady; ten ounces each. Gentlemen,\" cried the captain to the\npassengers, who stood aghast--\"why don't you promise?--promise, I say;\n_promise_, at all events.\"\n\n\"The Phantom Ship--_The Flying Dutchman_\" shrieked Schriften; \"I told\nyou so, Philip Vanderdecken; there is your father--He! he!\"\n\nPhilip's eyes had remained fixed on the vessel; he perceived that they\nwere lowering down a boat from her quarter. \"It is possible,\" thought\nhe, \"I shall now be permitted!\" and Philip put his hand into his bosom\nand grasped the relic.\n\nThe gloom now increased, so that the strange vessel's hull could\nbut just be discovered through the murky atmosphere. The seamen and\npassengers threw themselves down on their knees, and invoked their\nsaints. The captain ran down for a candle, to light before the image\nof St Antonio, which he took out of its shrine, and kissed with much\napparent affection and devotion, and then replaced.\n\nShortly afterwards the splash of oars was heard alongside, and a voice\ncalling out, \"I say, my good people, give us a rope from forward.\"\n\nNo one answered, or complied with the request. Schriften only went up\nto the captain, and told him that if they offered to send letters they\nmust not be received or the vessel would be doomed, and all would\nperish.\n\nA man now made his appearance from over the gunnel, at the gangway.\n\"You might as well have let me had a side rope, my hearties,\" said he,\nas he stepped on deck; \"where is the captain?\"\n\n\"Here,\" replied the captain, trembling from head to foot. The man who\naccosted him appeared a weather-beaten seaman, dressed in a fur cap\nand canvas petticoats; he held some letters in his hand.\n\n\"What do you want?\" at last screamed the captain.\n\n\"Yes--what do you want?\" continued Schriften. \"He! he!\"\n\n\"What, you here, pilot?\" observed the man; \"well--I thought you had\ngone to Davy's locker, long enough ago.\"\n\n\"He! he!\" replied Schriften, turning away.\n\n\"Why the fact is, captain, we have had very foul weather, and we wish\nto send letters home; I do believe that we shall never get round this\nCape.\"\n\n\"I can't take them,\" cried the captain.\n\n\"Can't take them! well, it's very odd--but every ship refuses to\ntake our letters; it's very unkind--seamen should have a feeling for\nbrother seamen, especially in distress. God knows, we wish to see our\nwives and families again; and it would be a matter of comfort to them,\nif they only could hear from us.\"\n\n\"I cannot take your letters--the saints preserve us;\" replied the\ncaptain.\n\n\"We have been a long while out,\" said the seaman, shaking his head.\n\n\"How long?\" inquired the captain, not knowing what to say.\n\n\"We can't tell; our almanack was blown overboard, and we have lost our\nreckoning. We never have our latitude exact now, for we cannot tell\nthe sun's declination for the right day.\"\n\n\"Let _me_ see your letters,\" said Philip, advancing, and taking them\nout of the seaman's hands.\n\n\"They must not be touched,\" screamed Schriften.\n\n\"Out, monster!\" replied Philip, \"who dares interfere with me?\"\n\n\"Doomed--doomed--doomed!\" shrieked Schriften, running up and down the\ndeck, and then breaking into a wild fit of laughter.\n\n\"Touch not the letters,\" said the captain, trembling as if in an ague\nfit.\n\nPhilip made no reply, but held his hand out for the letters.\n\n\"Here is one from our second mate, to his wife at Amsterdam, who lives\non Waser Quay.\"\n\n\"Waser Quay has long been gone, my good friend; there is now a large\ndock for ships where it once was,\" replied Philip.\n\n\"Impossible!\" replied the man; \"here is another from the boatswain to\nhis father, who lives in the old market-place.\"\n\n\"The old market-place has long been pulled down, and there now stands\na church upon the spot.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" replied the seaman; \"here is another from myself to my\nsweetheart, Vrow Ketser--with money to buy her a new brooch.\"\n\nPhilip shook his head--\"I remember seeing an old lady of that name\nburied some thirty years ago.\"\n\n\"Impossible! I left her young and blooming. Here's one for the house\nof Slutz & Co., to whom the ship belongs.\"\n\n\"There's no such house now,\" replied Philip; \"but I have heard, that\nmany years ago there was a firm of that name.\"\n\n\"Impossible! you must be laughing at me. Here is a letter from our\ncaptain to his son\"\n\n\"Give it me,\" cried Philip, seizing the letter, he was about to break\nthe seal, when Schriften snatched it out of his hand, and threw it\nover the lee gunnel.\n\n\"That's a scurvy trick for an old shipmate,\" observed the seaman.\nSchriften made no reply, but catching up the other letters which\nPhilip had laid down on the capstan, he hurled them after the first.\n\nThe strange seaman shed tears, and walked again to the side:--\"It is\nvery hard--very unkind,\" observed he, as he descended; \"the time may\ncome when you may wish that your family should know your situation;\"\nso saying, he disappeared: in a few seconds was heard the sound of the\noars, retreating from the ship.\n\n\"Holy St Antonio!\" exclaimed the captain, \"I am lost in wonder and\nfright. Steward, bring me up the arrack.\"\n\nThe steward ran down for the bottle; being as much alarmed as his\ncaptain, he helped himself before he brought it up to his commander.\n\"Now,\" said the captain, after keeping his mouth for two minutes to\nthe bottle, and draining it to the bottom, \"what is to be done next?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you,\" said Schriften, going up to him. \"That man there has\na charm hung round his neck; take it from him and throw it overboard,\nand your ship will be saved; if not, it will be lost, with every soul\non board.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, it's all right depend upon it;\" cried the sailors.\n\n\"Fools,\" replied Philip, \"do you believe that wretch? Did you not hear\nthe man who came on board recognise him, and call him shipmate? He is\nthe party whose presence on board will prove so unfortunate.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" cried the sailors, \"it's all right, the man did call him\nshipmate.\"\n\n\"I tell you it's all wrong,\" cried Schriften; \"that is the man, let\nhim give up the charm.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; let him give up the charm,\" cried the sailors, and they\nrushed upon Philip.\n\nPhilip started back to where the captain stood. \"Mad-men, know ye what\nye are about? It is the holy cross that I wear round my neck. Throw it\noverboard if you dare, and your souls are lost for ever;\" and Philip\ntook the relic from his bosom and showed it to the captain.\n\n\"No, no, men;\" exclaimed the captain, who was now more settled in his\nnerves; \"that won't do--the saints protect us.\"\n\nThe seamen, however, became clamorous; one portion were for throwing\nSchriften overboard, the other for throwing Philip; at last, the point\nwas decided by the captain, who directed the small skiff, hanging\nastern, to be lowered down, and ordered both Philip and Schriften to\nget into it. The seamen approved of this arrangement, as it satisfied\nboth parties. Philip made no objection; Schriften screamed and fought,\nbut he was tossed into the boat. There he remained trembling in the\nstern sheets, while Philip, who had seized the sculls, pulled away\nfrom the vessel in the direction of the Phantom Ship.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XLII\n\n\nIn a few minutes the vessel which Philip and Schriften had left was no\nlonger to be discerned through the thick haze; the Phantom Ship was\nstill in sight, but at a much greater distance from them than she was\nbefore. Philip pulled hard towards her, but although hove-to, she\nappeared to increase her distance from the boat. For a short time he\npaused on his oars, to regain his breath, when Schriften rose up and\ntook his seat in the stern sheets of the boat. \"You may pull and pull,\nPhilip Vanderdecken,\" observed Schriften; \"but you will not gain that\nship--no, no, that cannot be--we may have a long cruise together, but\nyou will be as far from your object at the end of it, as you are now\nat the commencement.--Why don't you throw me overboard again? You\nwould be all the lighter--He! he!\"\n\n\"I threw you overboard in a state of frenzy,\" replied Philip, \"when\nyou attempted to force from me my relic.\"\n\n\"And have I not endeavoured to make others take it from you this very\nday?--Have I not--He! he!\"\n\n\"You have,\" rejoined Philip; \"but I am now convinced, that you are\nas unhappy as myself, and that in what you are doing, you are only\nfollowing your destiny, as I am mine. Why, and wherefore I cannot\ntell, but we are both engaged in the same mystery;--if the success of\nmy endeavours depends upon guarding the relic, the success of yours\ndepends upon your obtaining it, and defeating my purpose by so doing.\nIn this matter we are both agents, and you have been, as far as my\nmission is concerned, my most active enemy. But, Schriften, I have\nnot forgotten, and never will, that you kindlily _did advise_ my poor\nAmine; that you prophesied to her what would be her fate, if she did\nnot listen to your counsel; that you were no enemy of hers, although\nyou have been, and are still mine. Although my enemy, for her sake _I\nforgive you_, and will not attempt to harm you.\"\n\n\"You do then _forgive your enemy_, Philip Vanderdecken?\" replied\nSchriften, mournfully, \"for such, I acknowledge myself to be.\"\n\n\"I do, with _all my heart, with all my soul_,\" replied Philip.\n\n\"Then have you conquered me, Philip Vanderdecken; you have now made me\nyour friend, and your wishes are about to be accomplished. You would\nknow who I am. Listen:--when your Father, defying the Almighty's will,\nin his rage took my life, he was vouchsafed a chance of his doom being\ncancelled, through the merits of his son. I had also my appeal, which\nwas for _vengeance_; it was granted that I should remain on earth,\nand thwart your will. That as long as we were enemies, you should not\nsucceed; but that when you had conformed to the highest attribute\nof Christianity, proved on the holy cross, that of _forgiving your\nenemy_, your task should be fulfilled. Philip Vanderdecken, you have\nforgiven your enemy, and both our destinies are now accomplished.\"\n\nAs Schriften spoke, Philip's eyes were fixed upon him. He extended his\nhand to Philip--it was taken; and as it was pressed, the form of the\npilot wasted as it were into the air, and Philip found himself alone.\n\n\"Father of Mercy, I thank Thee,\" said Philip, \"that my task is done,\nand that I again may meet my Amine.\"\n\nPhilip then pulled towards the Phantom Ship, and found that she no\nlonger appeared to leave him; on the contrary, every minute he was\nnearer and nearer, and at last he threw in his oars, climbed up her\nsides, and gained her deck.\n\nThe crew of the vessel crowded round him.\n\n\"Your captain,\" said Philip; \"I must speak with your captain.\"\n\n\"Who shall I say, sir?\" demanded one, who appeared to be the first\nmate.\n\n\"Who?\" replied Philip; \"tell him his son would speak to him, his son\nPhilip Vanderdecken.\"\n\nShouts of laughter from the crew, followed this answer of Philip's;\nand the mate, as soon as they ceased, observed with a smile,\n\n\"You forget, sir, perhaps you would say his father.\"\n\n\"Tell him his son, if you please,\" replied Philip, \"take no note of\ngrey hairs.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, here he is coming forward,\" replied the mate, stepping\naside, and pointing to the captain.\n\n\"What is all this?\" inquired the captain.\n\n\"Are you Philip Vanderdecken, the captain of this vessel?\"\n\n\"I am, sir,\" replied the other.\n\n\"You appear not to know me! But how can you? you saw me but when I was\nonly three years old; yet may you remember a letter which you gave to\nyour wife.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" replied the captain; \"and who then are you?\"\n\n\"Time has stopped with you, but with those who live in the world he\nstops not! and for those who pass a life of misery, he hurries on\nstill faster. In me, behold your son, Philip Vanderdecken, who has\nobeyed your wishes; and after a life of such peril and misery as few\nhave passed, has at last fulfilled his vow, and now offers to his\nfather the precious relic that he required to kiss.\"\n\nPhilip drew out the relic, and held it towards his father. As if a\nflash of lightning had passed through his mind, the captain of the\nvessel started back, clasped his hands, fell on his knees, and wept.\n\n\"My son, my son!\" exclaimed he, rising, and throwing himself into\nPhilip's arms, \"my eyes are opened--the Almighty knows how long they\nhave been obscured.\" Embracing each other, they walked aft, away from\nthe men, who were still crowded at the gangway.\n\n\"My son, my noble son, before the charm is broken--before we resolve,\nas we must, into the elements, oh! let me kneel in thanksgiving\nand contrition: my son, my noble son, receive a father's thanks,\"\nexclaimed Vanderdecken. Then with tears of joy and penitence he humbly\naddressed himself to that Being, whom he once so awfully defied.\n\nThe elder Vanderdecken knelt down: Philip did the same; still\nembracing each other with one arm, while they raised on high the\nother, and prayed.\n\nFor the last time the relic was taken from the bosom of Philip and\nhanded to his father--and his father raised his eyes to heaven and\nkissed it. And as he kissed it, the long tapering upper spars of the\nPhantom vessel, the yards and sails that were set, fell into dust,\nfluttered in the air and sank upon the wave. Then mainmast, foremast,\nbowsprit, everything above the deck, crumbled into atoms and\ndisappeared.\n\nAgain he raised the relic to his lips, and the work of destruction\ncontinued, the heavy iron guns sank through the decks and disappeared;\nthe crew of the vessel (who were looking on) crumbled down into\nskeletons, and dust, and fragments of ragged garments; and there were\nnone left on board the vessel in the semblance of life but the father\nand the son.\n\nOnce more did he put the sacred emblem to his lips, and the beams\nand timbers separated, the decks of the vessel slowly sank, and the\nremnants of the hull floated upon, the water; and as the father and\nson--the one young and vigorous, the other old and decrepit--still\nkneeling, still embracing, with their hands raised to heaven, sank\nslowly under the deep blue wave, the lurid sky was for a moment\nillumined by a lightning cross.\n\nThen did the clouds which obscured the heavens roll away swift as\nthought--the sun again burst out in all his splendour--the rippling\nwaves appeared to dance with joy. The screaming sea-gull again whirled\nin the air, and the scared albatross once more slumbered on the wing.\nThe porpoise tumbled and tossed in his sportive play, the albicore and\ndolphin leaped from the sparkling sea.--All nature smiled as if it\nrejoiced that the charm was dissolved for ever, and that \"THE PHANTOM\nSHIP\" WAS NO MORE.",

He had a number of subjects who used to work underground,\nand their labour was to bring to the surface the black diamonds of\nthe earth. It was not altogether a pleasant occupation, but still,\nthe task had to be accomplished. His Majesty was fond of ferocious\npractical jokes, and perchance this may have been the origin of\nthe jocular description attached to his name. One day, some of his\nsubjects complained that their hours of labour were too many.\n\n\"How long do you work?\" asked the King.\n\n\"May it please you, Sire, sixteen,\" was the reply.\n\n\"Try what you can do with twelve,\" and they were about to depart\nrejoicing, when the Monarch called them back and added, \"But mind you,\nI shall expect just as many black diamonds to be unearthed as before.\"\n\nSo the King's subjects worked only twelve hours, and strange to say,\nquite as many black diamonds were produced as in the olden days. Then\nthe workmen began to grumble once more, and the King again interviewed\nthem.\n\n\"Do you still work twelve hours?\" he asked the deputation.\n\n\"Certainly, Your Majesty; but we think half would be quite enough,\"\nreturned the spokesman.\n\n\"By all means--why not make it three hours?\" and again his subjects\nwere departing, rejoicing, when once more he added, \"But I shall\nexpect just the same output as before.\"\n\nAnd he got it, for the men worked harder than ever. And then they\ncame yet again to him. Once more they considered the hours of labour\nexcessive. They thought sixty minutes plenty.\n\n\"So do I,\" replied the Monarch, \"not only plenty, but too many. But\nas it is scarcely worth while employing you only half an hour a day,\nI shall make other arrangements.\"\n\nAnd from that time forth he brought up his black diamonds from the\ncentre of the earth by machinery!\n\nNOT \"HALF A CHAP.\"--A well-known Clergyman, who \"does nothing by\nhalves.\" i.e., Dean HOLE.\n\n[Illustration: \"WHEN A MAN DOES NOT LOOK HIS BEST.\"--NO. 4.\n\nWHEN HE JUST BEGINS TO REALISE WHAT A SUFFERING HE WOULD HAVE SAVED\nHIMSELF, IF HE HAD ONLY HAD THE _COURAGE_ TO SAY \"_MEDIUM_\" INSTEAD OF\n\"HARD.\"]\n\nOUR BOOKING-OFFICE.\n\n[Illustration: The Baron's Retainers, Mesdames Blythe and Gay, giving\nhim the results of their readings.]\n\nIn the Christmas Numbers of the numerous picture-papers it is at first\nrather difficult to discover which is the genuine article illustrated,\nand which the advertisement, likewise illustrated. In the outside\npicture of the Christmas Number of _The Penny Illustrated Paper_,\nwhich represents a couple dancing together, I am not yet quite sure\nthat the handsome Hebraic gentleman, dancing with a fair Anglo-Saxon\ngirl, is not assuring his frightened-looking partner that \"Epps's\nCocoa is Grateful--Comforting,\" as stated in the paragraph immediately\nbeneath the aforesaid picture. On the next page is a sad illustration\nentitled, \"The Curse of Revenge. Lost to Human Aid.\" which turns out\nto be not a Christmas story at all, but an advertisement for Fruit\nSalt. Then opposite this commences a story by GEORGE R. SIMS; and at\nthe foot of this page some one replies, \"Mr. DOOLAN! There's no one\nof that name here now, Sir.\" Whereupon, being interested, the reader\nturns over page 1 to find at the head of page 2, not the continuation\nof the above interesting story in the shape of some remark on the part\nof the inquirer, nor any account of what happened after this reply\nhad been given, but simply \"Benson's Watches\" followed by \"Fry's\nChocolate,\" then a picture (not an advertisement) facing that, and\nthen on page 4 the remainder of the dialogue. It doesn't much matter\nperhaps, as the excitement aroused by the story is not violent, and\nthe mistake of giving somebody else's card for your own does not occur\nhere for the first time as the motive of a plot. CUTHBERT BEDE's name\nis to a \"Christmas Carol,\" and Mr. JOHN LATEY's to a dramatically told\ntale called \"Mark Temple's Trial,\" in which the imaginary heroine\npays a visit to a very real person of the name of Madame KATTI\nLANNER, whose pupils are represented as all assembled, with bouquets\nand posies, to do honour to the birthday of their \"well-loved\nmistress,\" who is at the same time, \"the acknowledged mistress of the\nchoreographic art.\" In this story, the author is to be complimented\non his invention of the name, \"Lord Morgagemore\" as an ancient looking\nand highly aristocratic Irish title.\n\n\"Up to any game at Christmas, if it's not too high,\" says the Baron\nof Hampershire, who detests all game that is lofty, but is glad to\nwelcome a Shakspearian Revival by MYERS & Co. in the shape of a _Nine\nMen's Morris_, a title the Baron recommends to the notice of Mr.\nWILLIAM MORRIS, yclept \"BILLY,\" when he is making another bouquet of\npoesies. By the way, BIM BROS.' Almanac Cards, one of the Baron's\nLady Helps describes as \"decidedly dainty.\" Christmas is specially a\ncard-playing season, a time of _Pax_ to everybody.\n\nFrom the _Gordon Stables_ of HUTCHINSON & Co. issues the nightmare\ntale of _The Cruise in the Crystal Boat_; when finished, try their\n_Family Difficulty_, by SARAH DOUDNEY. Send to the Deanery of DEAN AND\nSON, ask for _Baby's Biography_ and _The Little One's Own Beehive_.\nThe Spindleside department of the Baron's Booking-Office recommends\nboth the above for the Tiny Trots; while the Spearside tells the\nboys to go in for MANVILLE FENN's _Burr Junior_ and Mrs. R. LEE's\n_Adventures in Australia_. Then for all-comers, procure BEATRICE\nHARRADEN's _New Book of Fairies_, for, our \"Co.\" thus puts it, \"This\nis all concerning those poor little Fairies, about whom no one takes\nany trouble, and who are left out in the cold at Christmas time.\"\nThus for this week conclude the duties of Mesdames BLYTHE and GAY,\nthe Baron's Lady Assistant Perusers. \"I trust my gentle Public will\nbenefit by their advice,\" quoth,\n\nTheirs truly,\n\nTHE BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.\n\n\"NOW YOU'RE QUITE THE GENTLEMAN!\"\n\n(_A BALLAD OF BIRMINGHAM._)\n\n    [\"You will not find an alliance in which the weaker side has\n    been so loyal, so straight, so single-hearted, so patriotic\n    as the Liberal Unionists have been during the last five\n    years....

She's\njust been marryin' her daughter, you know--rather a good match, too.\nNot what I call pretty,--smart-lookin', that's all. But then her\n_sister_ wasn't pretty till she married.\n\n_Col.

I really think, dear, it would be better if we\nall kept together--for so _many_ reasons!\n\n_Culch._ (_with alacrity_). I agree with Miss PRENDERGAST.

He advocates direct ways, as best in the long run.\n\n_Miss T._ It's only going to be a short run, my love.

The struggles of _Mr. and Mrs. Bompas_ to conceal this\n_mésalliance_, and the assistance given them in their difficulties by\nthe _Hon. Montague Trimble_, constitute the motive of the play. But\nthe question that must occur to the critical mind is, \"Did the author\nmean this piece for high comedy, or farcical comedy?\" If the former,\nthen Mr. TERRY is wrong in his conception of the part; if the latter,\neverybody else is wrong in their conception of their parts.\n\nIt seems to me as if, in the course of rehearsal, the peculiarities\ndistinguishing the character of _Percy Egerton Bompas, M.P._, had\ngradually become assimilated with the individualities of the actor,\nMr. EDWARD TERRY. If Mr. PINERO so meant it, if he so wrote it for Mr.\nTERRY and for Mr. TERRY only, then there is nothing more to be said;\nMr. PINERO's ideal is realised. But if the author did _not_ intend Mr.\nTERRY's impersonation, then he must be content to sacrifice the ideal\nto the real, shrug his shoulders, and pocket his profits. Yet, as if\nmaking an appeal to the public to judge between the auctorial abstract\nand the representational concrete, Mr. PINERO not only publishes his\nplaybook, but sells it in the theatre. Visitors to TERRY's, who buy\nthe book, will judge the play by its stage interpretation that has had\nthe advantage of the author's personal supervision and direction. The\nrepresentation, therefore, is either more or less in accordance with\nhis teaching, or flatly contradicts it.\n\n[Illustration: One of the Leaders in _The Times_.]\n\nThe publication of the book of a comedy in a theatre may be thankfully\nreceived as a present help to the audience, and an aid to memory\nafterwards, or it may be considered as a protest on the part of the\nauthor who says, \"Here's what I have written. See how they act it:\nwhether it be farce or comedy, judge for yourselves. You pay your\nmoney, and you take your choice.\" Suffice it, then, to record that, on\nthe night of this deponent's visit, the piece played from eight till\npast eleven, and that the audience from first to last was generally\namused, but, I should be inclined to say, particularly disappointed\nat the collapse of Mr. TERRY's part in the last Act (the principal\nportion of which he passes curled up on a sofa, with the top of\nhis forehead powdered white! Why?), and mystified by the sudden and\napparently unnecessary revelation, made by _Miss Cazalet_, to the\neffect that _Lucy Tuck_ (a mentally and physically short-sighted girl)\nis her illegitimate daughter; and these two last-named personages,\nthough essential to the plot, fail unfortunately in rousing any\nsentiment of pity or of sympathy.\n\nMr. ELLIOT is excellent as the _Hon. Montague Trimble_; nothing\nbetter, apart from Mr. HARE's eccentric characters, has been seen on\nthe stage for some considerable time. I hope the author is of the same\nopinion. Mr. FRED THORNE is capital as the Irish Member; and as _Mrs.\nHooley_, an obtrusively Irish eccentricity of Thackerayan extraction,\nMiss ALEXES LEIGHTON is very good, for the character, as drawn by\nthe author, _is_ obtrusive, and is so meant to be. The _Mrs. Egerton\nBompas_ of Miss FANNY BROUGH is _the_ woman to the life, and, in my\nhumble judgment, Miss BROUGH's impersonation is well-nigh faultless.\nWhether, if the part of _Egerton Bompas_ were played as high comedy,\nthis would still improve Miss BROUGH's impersonation of _Mrs. Bompas_\nor not, it is difficult to decide; but I am inclined to think this\nwould be the result. What does the author think? Most likely he will\ncontinue to \"think\"; it is the wiser course. Mr. HENRY V. ESMOND makes\nthe lad, _Howard Bompas_, unnecessarily repulsive; but if, in doing\nso, he is only exactly carrying out the author's idea, i.e., \"Master's\norders,\" then he is no longer responsible for the overcharged\ncolouring. The probable fate of this unhappy pair, an impulsive\nuneducated kind of Irish orange-girl married to a contemptible\nyoung sot, is not a pleasant termination to the story, nor is the\nanticipatory sadness felt for the future of this ill-assorted couple\nin any way dissipated by the stereotyped and perfunctory offer of\nmarriage made by the young London Journal Nobleman to the daughter of\nthe utterly crushed snob just before the Curtain descends.\n\nWhy the piece is called _The Times_, remains a mystery. _To-day_\nwould have been better; that is, if by _The Times_ is only meant \"The\nPresent Day.\" And if it doesn't mean this, what meaning has it? For\nalliterative advertisement it may be useful; e.g., \"Times at TERRY's.\"\nThe dialogue generally is easy, natural and telling.\n\nYours,\n\nPRIVATE BOX.\n\nFOLLOW THE BARON!\n\n    [\"Such characters as he should retire into fiction, they\n    are too exaggerated for real life.\"--_\"Times\" on Mr. R.L.\n    Stevenson's Sad Maron of Samou._]\n\n  Oh, most excellent true!

It was the very day the\nMarquis DE MOULIN had been elected Pompier. The other guests were,\nHis Excellency the CON OF CRIM TARTARY, Prince ALLEZ-VOUS-EN, His\nExcellency the VICUNA of BRAZIL, the SANDWICH AMBASSADOR, the DOGE of\nVENICE, and the Baron MUNCHAUSEN, who was a kind of amateur partner of\nmine, in whom I had much confidence--I always left him with my day's\ncorrespondence ready to be committed to paper. In the course of the\ndinner a stupid _garçon_, handing the ice round, dropped a small piece\ndown the back of the neck of the DOGE of VENICE. With great presence\nof mind Baron MUNCHAUSEN seized the poker (which fortunately happened\nto be in the fire), and, with inimitable dexterity, passed the red-hot\nbrand between the DOGE's shirt-collar and his neck, and, deftly\ntouching the piece of ice, melted it. It was an awkward moment. The\ncanned lobster was just served, but no one thought of eating it. The\nCON of CRIM TARTARY turning to Baron MAC HINERY, said,--\n\n\"You, my Lord, who are disinterested in this matter, tell us what you\nthink of it.\"\n\n\"I think,\" replied the Baron, with admirable _sangfroid_, \"his\nHighness the DOGE would have felt better if the ice had been warmer,\nand the poker cooler.\"\n\nEverybody laughed.

PUNCH ON TOUR IN YORKSHIRE.]\n\n\"ON THE HYP\"-NOTIST.\n\n(_FRAGMENT FROM A ROMANCE PURELY IMAGINARY AND YET TO BE WRITTEN._)\n\nThe _Savants_ were gathered together to consider the question of\nHypnotism. They had been appointed by a learned Association, and their\nHon. Secretary had distinguished himself by writing a letter, which if\neccentric in punctuation, was yet to the point.\n\n\"We must not forget, Gentlemen,\" said one of the learned persons,\n\"that we have been appointed to investigate the use of Hypnotism as\na therapeutic agent. It will be our duty to ascertain, if it is\npossible, that operations can be performed under the shield of its\nanæsthesia.\"\n\n\"You are indeed right,\" replied another, \"and it is fortunate in one\nsense that we have not had the advantage of greeting at our board,\nDoctor OWEN COLEMAN of Dunedin, Surbiton.\"\n\n\"Why so?\" asked a third.\n\n\"Because,\" returned _Savant_ No. 2, \"that distinguished Member of the\nMedical Profession can give instances of successful treatment under\nthe prescribed circumstances. For instance, JULES CLOQUET, as early\nas 1845 was using Hypnotism in the cause of painless surgery. However,\nour pleasant little gathering can do no harm.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" acquiesced _Savant_ No. 3. \"Although it is only right\nto remark that had we had Dr. COLEMAN's knowledge, we should have\npossibly considered it _qua_ Committee a trifle superfluous.\"\n\n\"Do you not think we ought to visit the Aquarium?\" asked the first\nspeaker. \"I am told that there is a Hypnotist who appears there twice\na-day, and whose exhibition, from a scientific point of view, should\nbe decidedly interesting.\"\n\nAfter this there was a speedy departure, and for some hours the\nCommittee lounged about the Aquarium, They there saw a female acrobat\nof great strength. Then they paid a visit to the Alhambra, where they\nmet a pleasant young lady, who, seemingly without any assistance,\nlifted four or five bulky gentlemen seated on a chair. This she did\nwithout any exertion and with a smiling countenance. On their return\nto their private room, they seemed somewhat hostile to the pretensions\nof the Hypnotist, whose feats they had just witnessed--they preferred\nto his performances the feats of the Magnetic Lady.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Quite a mistake,\" said one; \"instead of taking off a leg, or showing\nthe strength of a billiard cue, he makes men believe that they are\nswimming in a tank!\"\n\n\"Very undignified,\" remarked another; \"it would have been so much\nbetter had he performed a surgical operation--say, setting a compound\nfracture of the leg, like that performed by two medical men in 1845;\nand more interesting to the vast majority of the audience.\"\n\n\"But the Alhambra was excellent,\" was the reply. \"Suppose we send\nto our Committee a Report of the 'Magnetic Lady' and ignore the\nHypnotist?\"\n\nAnd so it was decided, and it was time to write their Report. Then\npens, ink, and paper were produced, and the _Savants_ prepared for\nwork. They had scarcely commenced, when a gentleman stood in their\nmidst, and glared at them. He gave them each a disc, and commanded\nthem to gaze upon its surface. Then, one by one, they fell over fast\nasleep. He placed them back in their chairs.\n\n\"Now for your Report,\" he murmured. \"And so you would ignore _my_\nshow and praise another! But you are in my power, and _shall_ obey\nme!

Though not a\nnative of Texas, “Uncle Lance” was entitled to be classed among its\npioneers, his parents having emigrated from Tennessee along with a\nparty of Stephen F. Austin’s colonists in 1821. The colony with which\nhis people reached the state landed at Quintana, at the mouth of the\nBrazos River, and shared the various hardships that befell all the\nearly Texan settlers, moving inland later to a more healthy locality.\nThus the education of young Lovelace was one of privation. Like other\nboys in pioneer families, he became in turn a hewer of wood or drawer\nof water, as the necessities of the household required, in reclaiming\nthe wilderness. When Austin hoisted the new-born Lone Star flag, and\ncalled upon the sturdy pioneers to defend it, the adventurous settlers\ncame from every quarter of the territory, and among the first who\nresponded to the call to arms was young Lance Lovelace. After San\nJacinto, when the fighting was over and the victory won, he laid down\nhis arms, and returned to ranching with the same zeal and energy. The\nfirst legislature assembled voted to those who had borne arms in behalf\nof the new republic, lands in payment for their services. With this\nland scrip for his pay, young Lovelace, in company with others, set out\nfor the territory lying south of the Nueces. They were a band of daring\nspirits. The country was primitive and fascinated them, and they\nremained. Some settled on the Frio River, though the majority crossed\nthe Nueces, many going as far south as the Rio Grande. The country was\nas large as the men were daring, and there was elbow room for all and\nto spare. Lance Lovelace located a ranch a few miles south of the\nNueces River, and, from the cooing of the doves in the encinal, named\nit Las Palomas.\n\n“When I first settled here in 1838,” said Uncle Lance to me one\nmorning, as we rode out across the range, “my nearest neighbor lived\nforty miles up the river at Fort Ewell. Of course there were some\nMexican families nearer, north on the Frio, but they don’t count. Say,\nTom, but she was a purty country then! Why, from those hills yonder,\nany morning you could see a thousand antelope in a band going into the\nriver to drink. And wild turkeys? Well, the first few years we lived\nhere, whole flocks roosted every night in that farther point of the\nencinal. And in the winter these prairies were just flooded with geese\nand brant. If you wanted venison, all you had to do was to ride through\nthose mesquite thickets north of the river to jump a hundred deer in a\nmorning’s ride. Oh, I tell you she was a land of plenty.”\n\nThe pioneers of Texas belong to a day and generation which has almost\ngone. If strong arms and daring spirits were required to conquer the\nwilderness, Nature seemed generous in the supply; for nearly all were\nstalwart types of the inland viking. Lance Lovelace, when I first met\nhim, would have passed for a man in middle life. Over six feet in\nheight, with a rugged constitution, he little felt his threescore\nyears, having spent his entire lifetime in the outdoor occupation of a\nranchman. Living on the wild game of the country, sleeping on the\nground by a camp-fire when his work required it, as much at home in the\nsaddle as by his ranch fireside, he was a romantic type of the\nstrenuous pioneer.\n\nHe was a man of simple tastes, true as tested steel in his friendships,\nwith a simple honest mind which followed truth and right as unerringly\nas gravitation. In his domestic affairs, however, he was unfortunate.\nThe year after locating at Las Palomas, he had returned to his former\nhome on the Colorado River, where he had married Mary Bryan, also of\nthe family of Austin’s colonists. Hopeful and happy they returned to\ntheir new home on the Nueces, but before the first anniversary of their\nwedding day arrived, she, with her first born, were laid in the same\ngrave. But grief does not kill, and the young husband bore his loss as\nbrave men do in living out their allotted day. But to the hour of his\ndeath the memory of Mary Bryan mellowed him into a child, and, when\nunoccupied, with every recurring thought of her or the mere mention of\nher name, he would fall into deep reverie, lasting sometimes for hours.\nAnd although he contracted two marriages afterward, they were simply\nmarriages of convenience, to which, after their termination, he\nfrequently referred flippantly, sometimes with irreverence, for they\nwere unhappy alliances.\n\nOn my arrival at Las Palomas, the only white woman on the ranch was\n“Miss Jean,” a spinster sister of its owner, and twenty years his\njunior. After his third bitter experience in the lottery of matrimony,\nevidently he gave up hope, and induced his sister to come out and\npreside as the mistress of Las Palomas. She was not tall like her\nbrother, but rather plump for her forty years. She had large gray eyes,\nwith long black eyelashes, and she had a trick of looking out from\nunder them which was both provoking and disconcerting, and no doubt\nmany an admirer had been deceived by those same roguish, laughing eyes.\nEvery man, Mexican and child on the ranch was the devoted courtier of\nMiss Jean, for she was a lovable woman; and in spite of her isolated\nlife and the constant plaguings of her brother on being a spinster, she\nfitted neatly into our pastoral life. It was these teasings of her\nbrother that gave me my first inkling that the old ranchero was a wily\nmatchmaker, though he religiously denied every such accusation. With a\nremarkable complacency, Jean Lovelace met and parried her tormentor,\nbut her brother never tired of his hobby while there was a third person\nto listen.\n\nThough an unlettered man, Lance Lovelace had been a close observer of\nhumanity. The big book of Life had been open always before him, and he\nhad profited from its pages. With my advent at Las Palomas, there were\nless than half a dozen books on the ranch, among them a copy of Bret\nHarte’s poems and a large Bible.\n\n“That book alone,” said he to several of us one chilly evening, as we\nsat around the open fireplace, “is the greatest treatise on humanity\never written. Go with me to-day to any city in any country in\nChristendom, and I’ll show you a man walk up the steps of his church on\nSunday who thanks God that he’s better than his neighbor. But you\nneedn’t go so far if you don’t want to. I reckon if I could see myself,\nI might show symptoms of it occasionally. Sis here thanks God daily\nthat she is better than that Barnes girl who cut her out of Amos\nAlexander. Now, don’t you deny it, for you know it’s gospel truth! And\nthat book is reliable on lots of other things. Take marriage, for\ninstance. It is just as natural for men and women to mate at the proper\ntime, as it is for steers to shed in the spring. But there’s no\nnecessity of making all this fuss about it. The Bible way discounts all\nthese modern methods. ‘He took unto himself a wife’ is the way it\ndescribes such events. But now such an occurrence has to be announced,\nmonths in advance. And after the wedding is over, in less than a year\nsometimes, they are glad to sneak off and get the bond dissolved in\nsome divorce court, like I did with my second wife.”\n\nAll of us about the ranch, including Miss Jean, knew that the old\nranchero’s views on matrimony could be obtained by leading up to the\nquestion, or differing, as occasion required. So, just to hear him talk\non his favorite theme, I said: “Uncle Lance, you must recollect this is\na different generation. Now, I’ve read books”—\n\n“So have I. But it’s different in real life. Now, in those novels you\nhave read, the poor devil is nearly worried to death for fear he’ll not\nget her. There’s a hundred things happens; he’s thrown off the scent\none day and cuts it again the next, and one evening he’s in a heaven of\nbliss and before the dance ends a rival looms up and there’s hell to\npay,—excuse me, Sis,—but he gets her in the end. And that’s the way it\ngoes in the books. But getting down to actual cases—when the money’s on\nthe table and the game’s rolling—it’s as simple as picking a sire and a\ndam to raise a race horse. When they’re both willing, it don’t require\nany expert to see it—a one-eyed or a blind man can tell the symptoms.\nNow, when any of you boys get into that fix, get it over with as soon\nas possible.”\n\n“From the drift of your remarks,” said June Deweese very innocently,\n“why wouldn’t it be a good idea to go back to the old method of letting\nthe parents make the matches?”\n\n“Yes; it would be a good idea. How in the name of common sense could\nyou expect young sap-heads like you boys to understand anything about a\nwoman? I know what I’m talking about. A single woman never shows her\ntrue colors, but conceals her imperfections. The average man is not to\nbe blamed if he fails to see through her smiles and Sunday humor. Now,\nI was forty when I married the second time, and forty-five the last\nwhirl. Looks like I’d a-had some little sense, now, don’t it? But I\ndidn’t. No, I didn’t have any more show than a snowball in—Sis, hadn’t\nyou better retire. You’re not interested in my talk to these\nboys.—Well, if ever any of you want to get married you have my consent.\nBut you’d better get my opinion on her dimples when you do. Now, with\nmy sixty odd years, I’m worth listening to. I can take a cool,\ndispassionate view of a woman now, and pick every good point about her,\njust as if she was a cow horse that I was buying for my own saddle.”\n\nMiss Jean, who had a ready tongue for repartee, took advantage of the\nfirst opportunity to remark: “Do you know, brother, matrimony is a\nsubject that I always enjoy hearing discussed by such an oracle as\nyourself. But did it never occur to you what an unjust thing it was of\nProvidence to reveal so much to your wisdom and conceal the same from\nus babes?”\n\nIt took some little time for the gentle reproof to take effect, but\nUncle Lance had an easy faculty of evading a question when it was\ncontrary to his own views. “Speaking of the wisdom of babes,” said he,\n“reminds me of what Felix York, an old ’36 comrade of mine, once said.\nHe had caught the gold fever in ’49, and nothing would do but he and\nsome others must go to California. The party went up to Independence,\nMissouri, where they got into an overland emigrant train, bound for the\nland of gold. But it seems before starting, Senator Benton had made a\nspeech in that town, in which he made the prophecy that one day there\nwould be a railroad connecting the Missouri River with the Pacific\nOcean. Felix told me this only a few years ago. But he said that all\nthe teamsters made the prediction a byword. When, crossing some of the\nmountain ranges, the train halted to let the oxen blow, one\nbull-whacker would say to another: ‘Well, I’d like to see old Tom\nBenton get his railroad over _this_ mountain.’ When Felix told me this\nhe said—‘There’s a railroad to-day crosses those same mountain passes\nover which we forty-niners whacked our bulls. And to think I was a\ngrown man and had no more sense or foresight than a little baby\nblinkin’ its eyes in the sun.’”\n\nWith years at Las Palomas, I learned to like the old ranchero. There\nwas something of the strong, primitive man about him which compelled a\nyouth of my years to listen to his counsel. His confidence in me was a\ncompliment which I appreciate to this day. When I had been in his\nemploy hardly two years, an incident occurred which, though only one of\nmany similar acts cementing our long friendship, tested his trust.\n\nOne morning just as he was on the point of starting on horseback to the\ncounty seat to pay his taxes, a Mexican arrived at the ranch and\nannounced that he had seen a large band of _javalina_ on the border of\nthe chaparral up the river. Uncle Lance had promised his taxes by a\ncertain date, but he was a true sportsman and owned a fine pack of\nhounds; moreover, the peccary is a migratory animal and does not wait\nupon the pleasure of the hunter. As I rode out from the corrals to\nlearn what had brought the vaquero with such haste, the old ranchero\ncried, “Here, Tom, you’ll have to go to the county seat. Buckle this\nmoney belt under your shirt, and if you lack enough gold to cover the\ntaxes, you’ll find silver here in my saddle-bags. Blow the horn, boys,\nand get the guns. Lead the way, Pancho. And say, Tom, better leave the\nroad after crossing the Sordo, and strike through that mesquite\ncountry,” he called back as he swung into the saddle and started,\nleaving me a sixty-mile ride in his stead. His warning to leave the\nroad after crossing the creek was timely, for a ranchman had been\nrobbed by bandits on that road the month before. But I made the ride in\nsafety before sunset, paying the taxes, amounting to over a thousand\ndollars.\n\nDuring all our acquaintance, extending over a period of twenty years,\nLance Lovelace was a constant revelation to me, for he was original in\nall things. Knowing no precedent, he recognized none which had not the\napproval of his own conscience. Where others were content to follow, he\nblazed his own pathways—immaterial to him whether they were followed by\nothers or even noticed. In his business relations and in his own way,\nhe was exact himself and likewise exacting of others. Some there are\nwho might criticise him for an episode which occurred about four years\nafter my advent at Las Palomas.\n\nMr. Whitley Booth, a younger man and a brother-in-law of the old\nranchero by his first wife, rode into the ranch one evening, evidently\non important business. He was not a frequent caller, for he was also a\nranchman, living about forty miles north and west on the Frio River,\nbut was in the habit of bringing his family down to the Nueces about\ntwice a year for a visit of from ten days to two weeks’ duration. But\nthis time, though we had been expecting the family for some little\ntime, he came alone, remained over night, and at breakfast ordered his\nhorse, as if expecting to return at once. The two ranchmen were holding\na conference in the sitting-room when a Mexican boy came to me at the\ncorrals and said I was wanted in the house. On my presenting myself, my\nemployer said: “Tom, I want you as a witness to a business transaction.\nI’m lending Whit, here, a thousand dollars, and as we have never taken\nany notes between us, I merely want you as a witness. Go into my room,\nplease, and bring out, from under my bed, one of those largest bags of\nsilver.”\n\nThe door was unlocked, and there, under the ranchero’s bed,\ndust-covered, were possibly a dozen sacks of silver. Finding one tagged\nwith the required amount, I brought it out and laid it on the table\nbetween the two men. But on my return I noticed Uncle Lance had turned\nhis chair from the table and was gazing out of the window, apparently\nabsorbed in thought. I saw at a glance that he was gazing into the\npast, for I had become used to these reveries on his part. I had not\nbeen excused, and an embarrassing silence ensued, which was only broken\nas he looked over his shoulder and said: “There it is, Whit; count it\nif you want to.”\n\nBut Mr. Booth, knowing the oddities of Uncle Lance, hesitated.\n“Well—why—Look here, Lance. If you have any reason for not wanting to\nloan me this amount, why, say so.”\n\n“There’s the money, Whit; take it if you want to. It’ll pay for the\nhundred cows you are figuring on buying. But I was just thinking: can\ntwo men at our time of life, who have always been friends, afford to\ntake the risk of letting a business transaction like this possibly make\nus enemies? You know I started poor here, and what I have made and\nsaved is the work of my lifetime. You are welcome to the money, but if\nanything should happen that you didn’t repay me, you know I wouldn’t\nfeel right towards you. It’s probably my years that does it, but—now, I\nalways look forward to the visits of your family, and Jean and I always\nenjoy our visits at your ranch. I think we’d be two old fools to allow\nanything to break up those pleasant relations.” Uncle Lance turned in\nhis chair, and, looking into the downcast countenance of Mr. Booth,\ncontinued: “Do you know, Whit, that youngest girl of yours reminds me\nof her aunt, my own Mary, in a hundred ways. I just love to have your\ngirls tear around this old ranch—they seem to give me back certain\nglimpses of my youth that are priceless to an old man.”\n\n“That’ll do, Lance,” said Mr. Booth, rising and extending his hand. “I\ndon’t want the money now. Your view of the matter is right, and our\nfriendship is worth more than a thousand cattle to me. Lizzie and the\ngirls were anxious to come with me, and I’ll go right back and send\nthem down.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\nSHEPHERD’S FERRY\n\n\nWithin a few months after my arrival at Las Palomas, there was a dance\nat Shepherd’s Ferry. There was no necessity for an invitation to such\nlocal meets; old and young alike were expected and welcome, and a dance\nnaturally drained the sparsely settled community of its inhabitants\nfrom forty to fifty miles in every direction. On the Nueces in 1875,\nthe amusements of the countryside were extremely limited; barbecues,\ntournaments, and dancing covered the social side of ranch life, and\nwhether given up or down our home river, or north on the Frio, so they\nwere within a day’s ride, the white element of Las Palomas could always\nbe depended on to be present, Uncle Lance in the lead.\n\nShepherd’s Ferry is somewhat of a misnomer, for the water in the river\nwas never over knee-deep to a horse, except during freshets. There may\nhave been a ferry there once; but from my advent on the river there was\nnothing but a store, the keeper of which also conducted a road-house\nfor the accommodation of travelers. There was a fine grove for picnic\npurposes within easy reach, which was also frequently used for\ncamp-meeting purposes. Gnarly old live-oaks spread their branches like\na canopy over everything, while the sea-green moss hung from every limb\nand twig, excluding the light and lazily waving with every vagrant\nbreeze. The fact that these grounds were also used for camp-meetings\nonly proved the broad toleration of the people. On this occasion I\ndistinctly remember that Miss Jean introduced a lady to me, who was the\nwife of an Episcopal minister, then visiting on a ranch near Oakville,\nand I danced several times with her and found her very amiable.\n\nOn receipt of the news of the approaching dance at the ferry, we set\nthe ranch in order. Fortunately, under seasonable conditions work on a\ncattle range is never pressing. A programme of work outlined for a\ncertain week could easily be postponed a week or a fortnight for that\nmatter; for this was the land of “la mañana,” and the white element on\nLas Palomas easily adopted the easy-going methods of their Mexican\nneighbors. So on the day everything was in readiness. The ranch was a\ntrifle over thirty miles from Shepherd’s, which was a fair half day’s\nride, but as Miss Jean always traveled by ambulance, it was necessary\nto give her an early start. Las Palomas raised fine horses and mules,\nand the ambulance team for the ranch consisted of four mealy-muzzled\nbrown mules, which, being range bred, made up in activity what they\nlacked in size.\n\nTiburcio, a trusty Mexican, for years in the employ of Uncle Lance, was\nthe driver of the ambulance, and at an early morning hour he and his\nmules were on their mettle and impatient to start. But Miss Jean had a\nhundred petty things to look after. The lunch—enough for a round-up—was\nprepared, and was safely stored under the driver’s seat. Then there\nwere her own personal effects and the necessary dressing and tidying,\nwith Uncle Lance dogging her at every turn.\n\n“Now, Sis,” said he, “I want you to rig yourself out in something\nsumptuous, because I expect to make a killing with you at this dance.\nI’m almost sure that that Louisiana mule-drover will be there. You know\nyou made quite an impression on him when he was through here two years\nago. Well, I’ll take a hand in the game this time, and if there’s any\nmarry in him, he’ll have to lead trumps. I’m getting tired of having my\ndear sister trifled with by every passing drover. Yes, I am! The next\none that hangs around Las Palomas, basking in your smiles, has got to\ndeclare his intentions whether he buys mules or not. Oh, you’ve got a\nbrother, Sis, that’ll look out for you. But you must play your part.\nNow, if that mule-buyer’s there, shall I”—\n\n“Why, certainly, brother, invite him to the ranch,” replied Miss Jean,\nas she busied herself with the preparations. “It’s so kind of you to\nlook after me. I was listening to every word you said, and I’ve got my\nbest bib and tucker in that hand box. And just you watch me dazzle that\nMr. Mule-buyer. Strange you didn’t tell me sooner about his being in\nthe country. Here, take these boxes out to the ambulance. And, say, I\nput in the middle-sized coffee pot, and do you think two packages of\nground coffee will be enough? All right, then. Now, where’s my gloves?”\n\nWe were all dancing attendance in getting the ambulance off, but Uncle\nLance never relaxed his tormenting, “Come, now, hurry up,” said he, as\nJean and himself led the way to the gate where the conveyance stood\nwaiting; “for I want you to look your best this evening, and you’ll be\nall tired out if you don’t get a good rest before the dance begins.\nNow, in case the mule-buyer don’t show up, how about Sim Oliver? You\nsee, I can put in a good word there just as easily as not. Of course,\nhe’s a widower like myself, but you’re no spring pullet—you wouldn’t\nclass among the buds—besides Sim branded eleven hundred calves last\nyear. And the very last time I was talking to him, he allowed he’d\ncrowd thirteen hundred close this year—big calf crop, you see. Now,\njust why he should go to the trouble to tell me all this, unless he had\nhis eye on you, is one too many for me. But if you want me to cut him\nout of your string of eligibles, say the word, and I’ll chouse him out.\nYou just bet, little girl, whoever wins you has got to score right.\nGreat Scott! but you have good taste in selecting perfumery. Um-ee! it\nmakes me half drunk to walk alongside of you. Be sure and put some of\nthat ointment on your kerchief when you get there.”\n\n“Really,” said Miss Jean, as they reached the ambulance, “I wish you\nhad made a little memorandum of what I’m expected to do—I’m all in a\nflutter this morning. You see, without your help my case is hopeless.\nBut I think I’ll try for the mule-buyer. I’m getting tired looking at\nthese slab-sided cowmen. Now, just look at those mules—haven’t had a\nharness on in a month. And Tiburcio can’t hold four of them, nohow.\nLance, it looks like you’d send one of the boys to drive me down to the\nferry.”\n\n“Why, Lord love you, girl, those mules are as gentle as kittens; and\nyou don’t suppose I’m going to put some gringo over a veteran like\nTiburcio. Why, that old boy used to drive for Santa Anna during the\ninvasion in ’36. Besides, I’m sending Theodore and Glenn on horseback\nas a bodyguard. Las Palomas is putting her best foot forward this\nmorning in giving you a stylish turnout, with outriders in their Sunday\nlivery. And those two boys are the best ropers on the ranch, so if the\nmules run off just give one of your long, keen screams, and the boys\nwill rope and hog-tie every mule in the team. Get in now and don’t make\nany faces about it.”\n\nIt was pettishness and not timidity that ailed Jean Lovelace, for a\npioneer woman like herself had of course no fear of horse-flesh. But\nthe team was acting in a manner to unnerve an ordinary woman. With me\nclinging to the bits of the leaders, and a man each holding the\nwheelers, as they pawed the ground and surged about in their creaking\nharness, they were anything but gentle; but Miss Jean proudly took her\nseat; Tiburcio fingered the reins in placid contentment; there was a\nparting volley of admonitions from brother and sister—the latter was\ntelling us where we would find our white shirts—when Uncle Lance\nsignaled to us; and we sprang away from the team. The ambulance gave a\nlurch, forward, as the mules started on a run, but Tiburcio dexterously\nthrew them on to a heavy bed of sand, poured the whip into them as they\nlabored through it; they crossed the sand bed, Glenn Gallup and\nTheodore Quayle, riding, at their heads, pointed the team into the\nroad, and they were off.\n\nThe rest of us busied ourselves getting up saddle horses and dressing\nfor the occasion. In the latter we had no little trouble, for dress\noccasions like this were rare with us. Miss Jean had been thoughtful\nenough to lay our clothes out, but there was a busy borrowing of\ncollars and collar buttons, and a blacking of boots which made the\nsweat stand out on our foreheads in beads. After we were dressed and\nready to start, Uncle Lance could not be induced to depart from his\nusual custom, and wear his trousers outside his boots. Then we had to\npull the boots off and polish them clear up to the ears in order to\nmake him presentable. But we were in no particular hurry about\nstarting, as we expected to out across the country and would overtake\nthe ambulance at the mouth of the Arroyo Seco in time for the noonday\nlunch. There were six in our party, consisting of Dan Happersett, Aaron\nScales, John Cotton, June Deweese, Uncle Lance, and myself. With the\nexception of Deweese, who was nearly twenty-five years old, the\nremainder of the boys on the ranch were young fellows, several of whom\nbesides myself had not yet attained their majority. On ranch work, in\nthe absence of our employer, June was recognized as the _segundo_ of\nLos Palomas, owing to his age and his long employment on the ranch. He\nwas a trustworthy man, and we younger lads entertained no envy towards\nhim.\n\nIt was about nine o’clock when we mounted our horses and started. We\njollied along in a party, or separated into pairs in cross-country\nriding, covering about seven miles an hour. “I remember,” said Uncle\nLance, as we were riding in a group, “the first time I was ever at\nShepherd’s Ferry. We had been down the river on a cow hunt for about\nthree weeks and had run out of bacon. We had been eating beef, and\nvenison, and antelope for a week until it didn’t taste right any\nlonger, so I sent the outfit on ahead and rode down to the store in the\nhope of getting a piece of bacon. Shepherd had just established the\nplace at the time, and when I asked him if he had any bacon, he said he\nhad, ‘But is it good?’ I inquired, and before he could reply an\neight-year-old boy of his stepped between us, and throwing back his tow\nhead, looked up into my face and said: ‘Mister, it’s a little the best\nI ever tasted.’”\n\n“Now, June,” said Uncle Lance, as we rode along, “I want you to let\nHenry Annear’s wife strictly alone to-night. You know what a stink it\nraised all along the river, just because you danced with her once, last\nSan Jacinto day. Of course, Henry made a fool of himself by trying to\nborrow a six-shooter and otherwise getting on the prod. And I’ll admit\nthat it don’t take the best of eyesight to see that his wife to-day\nthinks more of your old boot than she does of Annear’s wedding suit,\nyet her husband will be the last man to know it. No man can figure to a\ncertainty on a woman. Three guesses is not enough, for she will and she\nwon’t, and she’ll straddle the question or take the fence, and when you\nput a copper on her to win, she loses. God made them just that way, and\nI don’t want to criticise His handiwork. But if my name is Lance\nLovelace, and I’m sixty-odd years old, and this a chestnut horse that\nI’m riding, then Henry Annear’s wife is an unhappy woman. But that\nfact, son, don’t give you any license to stir up trouble between man\nand wife. Now, remember, I’ve warned you not to dance, speak to, or\neven notice her on this occasion. The chances are that that locoed fool\nwill come heeled this time, and if you give him any excuse, he may burn\na little powder.”\n\nJune promised to keep on his good behavior, saying: “That’s just what\nI’ve made up my mind to do. But look’ee here: Suppose he goes on the\nwar path, you can’t expect me to show the white feather, nor let him\nrun any sandys over me. I loved his wife once and am not ashamed of it,\nand he knows it. And much as I want to obey you, Uncle Lance, if he\nattempts to stand up a bluff on me, just as sure as hell’s hot there’ll\nbe a strange face or two in heaven.”\n\nI was a new man on the ranch and unacquainted with the facts, so\nshortly afterwards I managed to drop to the rear with Dan Happersett,\nand got the particulars. It seems that June and Mrs. Annear had not\nonly been sweethearts, but that they had been engaged, and that the\nengagement had been broken within a month of the day set for their\nwedding, and that she had married Annear on a three weeks’\nacquaintance. Little wonder Uncle Lance took occasion to read the riot\nact to his _segundo_ in the interests of peace. This was all news to\nme, but secretly I wished June courage and a good aim if it ever came\nto a show-down between them.\n\nWe reached the Arroyo Seco by high noon, and found the ambulance in\ncamp and the coffee pot boiling. Under the direction of Miss Jean,\nTiburcio had removed the seats from the conveyance, so as to afford\nseating capacity for over half our number. The lunch was spread under\nan old live-oak on the bank of the Nueces, making a cosy camp. Miss\nJean had the happy knack of a good hostess, our twenty-mile ride had\nwhetted our appetites, and we did ample justice to her tempting spread.\nAfter luncheon was over and while the team was being harnessed in, I\nnoticed Miss Jean enticing Deweese off on one side, where the two held\na whispered conversation, seated on an old fallen tree. As they\nreturned, June was promising something which she had asked of him. And\nif there was ever a woman lived who could exact a promise that would be\nrespected, Jean Lovelace was that woman; for she was like an elder\nsister to us all.\n\nIn starting, the ambulance took the lead as before, and near the middle\nof the afternoon we reached the ferry. The merry-makers were assembling\nfrom every quarter, and on our arrival possibly a hundred had come,\nwhich number was doubled by the time the festivities began. We turned\nour saddle and work stock into a small pasture, and gave ourselves over\nto the fast-gathering crowd. I was delighted to see that Miss Jean and\nUncle Lance were accorded a warm welcome by every one, for I was\nsomewhat of a stray on this new range. But when it became known that I\nwas a recent addition to Las Palomas, the welcome was extended to me,\nwhich I duly appreciated.\n\nThe store and hostelry did a rushing business during the evening hours,\nfor the dance did not begin until seven. A Mexican orchestra,\nconsisting of a violin, an Italian harp, and two guitars, had come up\nfrom Oakville to furnish the music for the occasion. Just before the\ndance commenced, I noticed Uncle Lance greet a late arrival, and on my\ninquiring of June who he might be, I learned that the man was Captain\nFrank Byler from Lagarto, the drover Uncle Lance had been teasing Miss\nJean about in the morning, and a man, as I learned later, who drove\nherds of horses north on the trail during the summer and during the\nwinter drove mules and horses to Louisiana, for sale among the\nplanters. Captain Byler was a good-looking, middle-aged fellow, and I\nmade up my mind at once that he was due to rank as the lion of the\nevening among the ladies.\n\nIt is useless to describe this night of innocent revelry. It was a\nrustic community, and the people assembled were, with few exceptions,\npurely pastoral. There may have been earnest vows spoken under those\nspreading oaks—who knows? But if there were, the retentive ear which\nlistened, and the cautious tongue which spake the vows, had no\nintention of having their confidences profaned on this page. Yet it was\na night long to be remembered. Timid lovers sat apart, oblivious to the\ngaze of the merry revelers. Matrons and maidens vied with each other in\naffability to the sterner sex. I had a most enjoyable time.\n\nI spoke Spanish well, and made it a point to cultivate the acquaintance\nof the leader of the orchestra. On his learning that I also played the\nviolin, he promptly invited me to play a certain new waltz which he was\ndesirous of learning. But I had no sooner taken the violin in my hand\nthan the lazy rascal lighted a cigarette and strolled away, absenting\nhimself for nearly an hour. But I was familiar with the simple dance\nmusic of the country, and played everything that was called for. My\ntalent was quite a revelation to the boys of our ranch, and especially\nto the owner and mistress of Las Palomas. The latter had me play\nseveral old Colorado River favorites of hers, and I noticed that when\nshe had the dashing Captain Byler for her partner, my waltzes seemed\nnever long enough to suit her.\n\nAfter I had been relieved, Miss Jean introduced me to a number of nice\ngirls, and for the remainder of the evening I had no lack of partners.\nBut there was one girl there whom I had not been introduced to, who\nalways avoided my glance when I looked at her, but who, when we were in\nthe same set and I squeezed her hand, had blushed just too lovely. When\nthat dance was over, I went to Miss Jean for an introduction, but she\ndid not know her, so I appealed to Uncle Lance, for I knew he could\ngive the birth date of every girl present. We took a stroll through the\ncrowd, and when I described her by her big eyes, he said in a voice so\nloud that I felt sure she must hear: “Why, certainly, I know her.\nThat’s Esther McLeod. I’ve trotted her on my knee a hundred times.\nShe’s the youngest girl of old man Donald McLeod who used to ranch over\non the mouth of the San Miguel, north on the Frio. Yes, I’ll give you\nan interslaption.” Then in a subdued tone: “And if you can drop your\nrope on her, son, tie her good and fast, for she’s good stock.”\n\nI was made acquainted as his latest adopted son, and inferred the old\nranchero’s approbation by many a poke in the ribs from him in the\nintervals between dances; for Esther and I danced every dance together\nuntil dawn. No one could charge me with neglect or inattention, for I\nclose-herded her like a hired hand. She mellowed nicely towards me\nafter the ice was broken, and with the limited time at my disposal, I\nmade hay. When the dance broke up with the first signs of day, I\nsaddled her horse and assisted her to mount, when I received the cutest\nlittle invitation, ‘if ever I happened over on the San Miguel, to try\nand call.’ Instead of beating about the bush, I assured her bluntly\nthat if she ever saw me on Miguel Creek, it would be intentional; for I\nshould have made the ride purely to see her. She blushed again in a way\nwhich sent a thrill through me. But on the Nueces in ’75, if a fellow\ntook a fancy to a girl there was no harm in showing it or telling her\nso.\n\nI had been so absorbed during the latter part of the night that I had\npaid little attention to the rest of the Las Palomas outfit, though I\noccasionally caught sight of Miss Jean and the drover, generally\ndancing, sometimes promenading, and once had a glimpse of them\ntête-à-tête on a rustic settee in a secluded corner. Our employer\nseldom danced, but kept his eye on June Deweese in the interests of\npeace, for Annear and his wife were both present. Once while Esther and\nI were missing a dance over some light refreshment, I had occasion to\nwatch June as he and Annear danced in the same set. I thought the\nlatter acted rather surly, though Deweese was the acme of geniality,\nand was apparently having the time of his life as he tripped through\nthe mazes of the dance. Had I not known of the deadly enmity existing\nbetween them, I could never have suspected anything but friendship, he\nwas acting the part so perfectly. But then I knew he had given his\nplighted word to the master and mistress, and nothing but an insult or\nindignity could tempt him to break it.\n\nOn the return trip, we got the ambulance off before sunrise, expecting\nto halt and breakfast again at the Arroyo Seco. Aaron Scales and Dan\nHappersett acted as couriers to Miss Jean’s conveyance, while the rest\ndallied behind, for there was quite a cavalcade of young folks going a\ndistance our way. This gave Uncle Lance a splendid chance to quiz the\ngirls in the party. I was riding with a Miss Wilson from Ramirena, who\nhad come up to make a visit at a near-by ranch and incidentally attend\nthe dance at Shepherd’s. I admit that I was a little too much absorbed\nover another girl to be very entertaining, but Uncle Lance helped out\nby joining us. “Nice morning overhead, Miss Wilson,” said he, on riding\nup. “Say, I’ve waited just as long as I’m going to for that invitation\nto your wedding which you promised me last summer. Now, I don’t know so\nmuch about the young men down about Ramirena, but when I was a\nyoungster back on the Colorado, when a boy loved a girl he married her,\nwhether it was Friday or Monday, rain or shine. I’m getting tired of\nbeing put off with promises. Why, actually, I haven’t been to a wedding\nin three years. What are we coming to?”\n\n\n[Illustration: WE GOT THE AMBULANCE OFF BEFORE SUNRISE]\n\n\nOn reaching the road where Miss Wilson and her party separated from us,\nUncle Lance returned to the charge: “Now, no matter how busy I am when\nI get your invitation, I don’t care if the irons are in the fire and\nthe cattle in the corral, I’ll drown the fire and turn the cows out.\nAnd if Las Palomas has a horse that’ll carry me, I’ll merely touch the\nhigh places in coming. And when I get there I’m willing to do\nanything,—give the bride away, say grace, or carve the turkey. And\nwhat’s more, I never kissed a bride in my life that didn’t have good\nluck. Tell your pa you saw me. Good-by, dear.”\n\nOn overtaking the ambulance in camp, our party included about twenty,\nseveral of whom were young ladies; but Miss Jean insisted that every\none remain for breakfast, assuring them that she had abundance for all.\nAfter the impromptu meal was disposed of, we bade our adieus and\nseparated to the four quarters. Before we had gone far, Uncle Lance\nrode alongside of me and said: “Tom, why didn’t you tell me you was a\nfiddler? God knows you’re lazy enough to be a good one, and you ought\nto be good on a bee course. But what made me warm to you last night was\nthe way you built to Esther McLeod. Son, you set her cush about right.\nIf you can hold sight on a herd of beeves on a bad night like you did\nher, you’ll be a foreman some day. And she’s not only good blood\nherself, but she’s got cattle and land. Old man Donald, her father, was\nkilled in the Confederate army. He was an honest Scotchman who kept\nSunday and everything else he could lay his hands on. In all my travels\nI never met a man who could offer a longer prayer or take a bigger\ndrink of whiskey. I remember the first time I ever saw him. He was\nserving on the grand jury, and I was a witness in a cattle-stealing\ncase. He was a stranger to me, and we had just sat down at the same\ntable at a hotel for dinner. We were on the point of helping ourselves,\nwhen the old Scot arose and struck the table a blow that made the\ndishes rattle. ‘You heathens,’ said he, ‘will you partake of the bounty\nof your Heavenly Father without returning thanks?’ We laid down our\nknives and forks like boys caught in a watermelon patch, and the old\nman asked a blessing. I’ve been at his house often. He was a good man,\nbut Secession caught him and he never came back. So, Quirk, you see, a\nson-in-law will be a handy man in the family, and with the start you\nmade last night I hope for good results.” The other boys seemed to\nenjoy my embarrassment, but I said nothing in reply, being a new man\nwith the outfit. We reached the ranch an hour before noon, two hours in\nadvance of the ambulance; and the sleeping we did until sunrise the\nnext morning required no lullaby.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\nLAS PALOMAS\n\n\nThere is something about those large ranches of southern Texas that\nreminds one of the old feudal system. The pathetic attachment to the\nsoil of those born to certain Spanish land grants can only be compared\nto the European immigrant when for the last time he looks on the land\nof his birth before sailing. Of all this Las Palomas was typical. In\nthe course of time several such grants had been absorbed into its\nbaronial acres. But it had always been the policy of Uncle Lance never\nto disturb the Mexican population; rather he encouraged them to remain\nin his service. Thus had sprung up around Las Palomas ranch a little\nMexican community numbering about a dozen families, who lived in\n_jacals_ close to the main ranch buildings. They were simple people,\nand rendered their new master a feudal loyalty. There were also several\nsmall _ranchites_ located on the land, where, under the Mexican régime,\nthere had been pretentious adobe buildings. A number of families still\nresided at these deserted ranches, content in cultivating small fields\nor looking after flocks of goats and a few head of cattle, paying no\nrental save a service tenure to the new owner.\n\nThe customs of these Mexican people were simple and primitive. They\nblindly accepted the religious teachings imposed with fire and sword by\nthe Spanish conquerors upon their ancestors. A padre visited them\nyearly, christening the babes, marrying the youth, shriving the\npenitent, and saying masses for the repose of the souls of the\ndeparted. Their social customs were in many respects unique. For\ninstance, in courtship a young man was never allowed in the presence of\nhis inamorata, unless in company of others, or under the eye of a\nchaperon. Proposals, even among the nearest of neighbors or most\nintimate of friends, were always made in writing, usually by the father\nof the young man to the parents of the girl, but in the absence of\nsuch, by a godfather or _padrino_. Fifteen days was the term allowed\nfor a reply, and no matter how desirable the match might be, it was not\naccounted good taste to answer before the last day. The owner of Las\nPalomas was frequently called upon to act as _padrino_ for his people,\nand so successful had he always been that the vaqueros on his ranch\npreferred his services to those of their own fathers. There was\nscarcely a vaquero at the home ranch but, in time past, had invoked his\ngood offices in this matter, and he had come to be looked on as their\npatron saint.\n\nThe month of September was usually the beginning of the branding season\nat Las Palomas. In conducting this work, Uncle Lance was the leader,\nand with the white element already enumerated, there were twelve to\nfifteen vaqueros included in the branding outfit. The dance at\nShepherd’s had delayed the beginning of active operations, and a large\ncalf crop, to say nothing of horse and mule colts, now demanded our\nattention and promised several months’ work. The year before, Las\nPalomas had branded over four thousand calves, and the range was now\ndotted with the crop, awaiting the iron stamp of ownership.\n\nThe range was an open one at the time, compelling us to work far beyond\nthe limits of our employer’s land. Fortified with our own commissary,\nand with six to eight horses apiece in our mount, we scoured the\ncountry for a radius of fifty miles. When approaching another range, it\nwas our custom to send a courier in advance to inquire of the ranchero\nwhen it would be convenient for him to give us a rodeo. A day would be\nset, when our outfit and the vaqueros of that range rounded up all the\ncattle watering at given points. Then we cut out the Las Palomas brand,\nand held them under herd or started them for the home ranch, where the\ncalves were to be branded. In this manner we visited all the adjoining\nranches, taking over a month to make the circuit of the ranges.\n\nIn making the tour, the first range we worked was that of rancho Santa\nMaria, south of our range and on the head of Tarancalous Creek. On\napproaching the ranch, as was customary, we prepared to encamp and ask\nfor a rodeo. But in the choice of a vaquero to be dispatched on this\nmission, a spirited rivalry sprang up. When Uncle Lance learned that\nthe rivalry amongst the vaqueros was meant to embarrass Enrique Lopez,\nwho was _oso_ to Anita, the pretty daughter of the corporal of Santa\nMaria, his matchmaking instincts came to the fore. Calling Enrique to\none side, he made the vaquero confess that he had been playing for the\nfavor of the señorita at Santa Maria. Then he dispatched Enrique on the\nmission, bidding him carry the choicest compliments of Las Palomas to\nevery Don and Doña of Santa Maria. And Enrique was quite capable of\nadding a few embellishments to the old matchmaker’s extravagant\nflatteries.\n\nEnrique was in camp next morning, but at what hour of the night he had\nreturned is unknown. The rodeo had been granted for the following day;\nthere was a pressing invitation to Don Lance—unless he was willing to\noffend—to spend the idle day as the guest of Don Mateo. Enrique\nelaborated the invitation with a thousand adornments. But the owner of\nLas Palomas had lived nearly forty years among the Spanish-American\npeople on the Nueces, and knew how to make allowances for the\nexuberance of the Latin tongue. There was no telling to what extent\nEnrique could have kept on delivering messages, but to his employer he\nwas avoiding the issue.\n\n“But did you get to see Anita?” interrupted Uncle Lance. Yes, he had\nseen her, but that was about all. Did not Don Lance know the customs\namong the Castilians? There was her mother ever present, or if she must\nabsent herself, there was a bevy of _tias comadres_ surrounding her,\nuntil the Doña Anita dare not even raise her eyes to meet his. “To\nperdition with such customs, no?” The freedom of a cow camp is a\nsplendid opportunity to relieve one’s mind upon prevailing injustices.\n\n“Don’t fret your cattle so early in the morning, son,” admonished the\nwary matchmaker. “I’ve handled worse cases than this before. You\nMexicans are sticklers on customs, and we must deal with our neighbors\ncarefully. Before I show my hand in this, there’s just one thing I want\nto know—is the girl willing? Whenever you can satisfy me on that point,\nEnrique, just call on the old man. But before that I won’t stir a step.\nYou remember what a time I had over Tiburcio’s Juan—that’s so, you were\ntoo young then. Well, June here remembers it. Why, the girl just cut up\nshamefully. Called Juan an Indian peon, and bragged about her Castilian\nfamily until you’d have supposed she was a princess of the blood royal.\nWhy, it took her parents and myself a whole day to bring the girl\naround to take a sensible view of matters. On my soul, except that I\ndidn’t want to acknowledge defeat, I felt a dozen times like telling\nher to go straight up. And when she did marry you, she was as happy as\na lark—wasn’t she, Juan? But I like to have the thing over with\nin—well, say half an hour’s time. Then we can have refreshments, and\nsmoke, and discuss the prospects of the young couple.”\n\nUncle Lance’s question was hard to answer. Enrique had known the girl\nfor several years, had danced with her on many a feast day, and never\nlost an opportunity to whisper the old, old story in her willing ear.\nOthers had done the like, but the dark-eyed señorita is an adept in the\nart of coquetry, and there you are. But Enrique swore a great oath he\nwould know. Yes, he would. He would lay siege to her as he had never\ndone before. He would become _un oso grande_. Just wait until the\nbranding was over and the fiestas of the Christmas season were on, and\nwatch him dog her every step until he received her signal of surrender.\nWitness, all the saints, this row of Enrique Lopez, that the Doña Anita\nshould have no peace of mind, no, not for one little minute, until she\nhad made a complete capitulation. Then Don Lauce, the _padrino_ of Las\nPalomas, would at once write the letter which would command the hand of\nthe corporal’s daughter. Who could refuse such a request, and what was\na daughter of Santa Maria compared to a son of Las Palomas?\n\nTarancalous Creek ran almost due east, and rancho Santa Maria was\nlocated near its source, depending more on its wells for water supply\nthan on the stream which only flowed for a few months during the year.\nWhere the watering facilities were so limited the rodeo was an easy\nmatter. A number of small round-ups at each established watering point,\na swift cutting out of everything bearing the Las Palomas brand, and we\nmoved on to the next rodeo, for we had an abundance of help at Santa\nMaria. The work was finished by the middle of the afternoon. After\nsending, under five or six men, our cut of several hundred cattle\nwestward on our course, our outfit rode into rancho Santa Maria proper\nto pay our respects. Our wagon had provided an abundant dinner for our\nassistants and ourselves; but it would have been, in Mexican etiquette,\nextremely rude on our part not to visit the rancho and partake of a cup\nof coffee and a cigarette, thanking the ranchero on parting for his\nkindness in granting us the rodeo.\n\nSo when the last round-up was reached, Don Mateo and Uncle Lance turned\nthe work over to their corporals, and in advance rode up to Santa\nMaria. The vaqueros of our ranch were anxious to visit the rancho, so\nit devolved on the white element to take charge of the cut. Being a\nstranger to Santa Maria, I was allowed to accompany our _segundo_, June\nDeweese, on an introductory visit. On arriving at the rancho, the\nvaqueros scattered among the _jacals_ of their _amigos_, while June and\nmyself were welcomed at the _casa primero_. There we found Uncle Lance\npartaking of refreshment, and smoking a cigarette as though he had been\nborn a Señor Don of some ruling hacienda. June and I were seated at\nanother table, where we were served with coffee, wafers, and home-made\ncigarettes. This was perfectly in order, but I could hardly control\nmyself over the extravagant Spanish our employer was using in\nexpressing the amity existing between Santa Maria and Las Palomas. In\nordinary conversation, such as cattle and ranch affairs, Uncle Lance\nhad a good command of Spanish; but on social and delicate topics some\nof his efforts were ridiculous in the extreme. He was well aware of his\nshortcomings, and frequently appealed to me to assist him. As a boy my\nplaymates had been Mexican children, so that I not only spoke Spanish\nfluently but could also readily read and write it. So it was no\nsurprise to me that, before taking our departure, my employer should\ncommand my services as an interpreter in driving an entering wedge. He\nwas particular to have me assure our host and hostess of his high\nregard for them, and his hope that in the future even more friendly\nrelations might exist between the two ranches. Had Santa Maria no young\ncavalier for the hand of some daughter of Las Palomas? Ah! there was\nthe true bond for future friendships. Well, well, if the soil of this\nrancho was so impoverished, then the sons of Las Palomas must take the\nbit in their teeth and come courting to Santa Maria. And let Doña\nGregoria look well to her daughters, for the young men of Las Palomas,\ntrue to their race, were not only handsome fellows but ardent lovers,\nand would be hard to refuse.\n\nAfter taking our leave and catching up with the cattle, we pushed\nwestward for the Ganso, our next stream of water. This creek was a\ntributary to the Nueces, and we worked down it several days, or until\nwe had nearly a thousand cattle and were within thirty miles of home.\nTurning this cut over to June Deweese and a few vaqueros to take in to\nthe ranch and brand, the rest of us turned westward and struck the\nNueces at least fifty miles above Las Palomas. For the next few days\nour dragnet took in both sides of the Nueces, and when, on reaching the\nmouth of the Ganso, we were met by Deweese and the vaqueros we had\nanother bunch of nearly a thousand ready. Dan Happersett was dispatched\nwith the second bunch for branding, when we swung north to Mr. Booth’s\nranch on the Frio, where we rested a day. But there is little\nrecreation on a cow hunt, and we were soon under full headway again. By\nthe time we had worked down the Frio, opposite headquarters, we had too\nlarge a herd to carry conveniently, and I was sent in home with them,\nnever rejoining the outfit until they reached Shepherd’s Ferry. This\nwas a disappointment to me, for I had hopes that when the outfit worked\nthe range around the mouth of San Miguel, I might find some excuse to\nvisit the McLeod ranch and see Esther. But after turning back up the\nhome river to within twenty miles of the ranch, we again turned\nsouthward, covering the intervening ranches rapidly until we struck the\nTarancalous about twenty-five miles east of Santa Maria.\n\nWe had spent over thirty days in making this circle, gathering over\nfive thousand cattle, about one third of which were cows with calves by\ntheir sides. On the remaining gap in the circle we lost two days in\nwaiting for rodeos, or gathering independently along the Tarancalous,\nand, on nearing the Santa Maria range, we had nearly fifteen hundred\ncattle. Our herd passed within plain view of the rancho, but we did not\nturn aside, preferring to make a dry camp for the night, some five or\nsix miles further on our homeward course. But since we had used the\nmajority of our _remuda_ very hard that day, Uncle Lance dispatched\nEnrique and myself, with our wagon and saddle horses, by way of Santa\nMaria, to water our saddle stock and refill our kegs for camping\npurposes. Of course, the compliments of our employer to the ranchero of\nSanta Maria went with the _remuda_ and wagon.\n\nI delivered the compliments and regrets to Don Mateo, and asked the\npermission to water our saddle stock, which was readily granted. This\nrequired some time, for we had about a hundred and twenty-five loose\nhorses with us, and the water had to be raised by rope and pulley from\nthe pommel of a saddle horse. After watering the team we refilled our\nkegs, and the cook pulled out to overtake the herd, Enrique and I\nstaying to water the _remuda_. Enrique, who was riding the saddle\nhorse, while I emptied the buckets as they were hoisted to the surface,\nwas evidently killing time. By his dilatory tactics, I knew the young\nrascal was delaying in the hope of getting a word with the Doña Anita.\nBut it was getting late, and at the rate we were hoisting darkness\nwould overtake us before we could reach the herd. So I ordered Enrique\nto the bucket, while I took my own horse and furnished the hoisting\npower. We were making some headway with the work, when a party of\nwomen, among them the Doña Anita, came down to the well to fill vessels\nfor house use.\n\nThis may have been all chance—and then again it may not. But the\ngallant Enrique now outdid himself, filling jar after jar and lifting\nthem to the shoulder of the bearer with the utmost zeal and amid a\nprofusion of compliments. I was annoyed at the interruption in our\nwork, but I could see that Enrique was now in the highest heaven of\ndelight. The Doña Anita’s mother was present, and made it her duty to\nnotice that only commonplace formalities passed between her daughter\nand the ardent vaquero. After the jars were all filled, the bevy of\nwomen started on their return; but Doña Anita managed to drop a few\nfeet to the rear of the procession, and, looking back, quietly took up\none corner of her mantilla, and with a little movement, apparently all\ninnocence, flashed a message back to the entranced Enrique. I was aware\nof the flirtation, but before I had made more of it Enrique sprang down\nfrom the abutment of the well, dragged me from my horse, and in an\necstasy of joy, crouching behind the abutments, cried: Had I seen the\nsign? Had I not noticed her token? Was my brain then so befuddled? Did\nI not understand the ways of the señoritas among his people?—that they\nalways answered by a wave of the handkerchief, or the mantilla? Ave\nMaria, Tomas! Such stupidity! Why, to be sure, they could talk all day\nwith their eyes.\n\n\n[Illustration: FLASHED A MESSAGE BACK]\n\n\nA setting sun finally ended his confidences, and the watering was soon\nfinished, for Enrique lowered the bucket in a gallop. On our reaching\nthe herd and while we were catching our night horses, Uncle Lance\nstrode out to the rope corral, with the inquiry, what had delayed us.\n“Nothing particular,” I replied, and looked at Enrique, who shrugged\nhis shoulders and repeated my answer. “Now, look here, you young\nliars,” said the old ranchero; “the wagon has been in camp over an\nhour, and, admitting it did start before you, you had plenty of time to\nwater the saddle stock and overtake it before it could possibly reach\nthe herd. I can tell a lie myself, but a good one always has some\nplausibility. You rascals were up to some mischief, I’ll warrant.”\n\nI had caught out my night horse, and as I led him away to saddle up,\nUncle Lance, not content with my evasive answer, followed me. “Go to\nEnrique,” I whispered; “he’ll just bubble over at a good chance to tell\nyou. Yes; it was the Doña Anita who caused the delay.” A smothered\nchuckling shook the old man’s frame, as he sauntered over to where\nEnrique was saddling. As the two led off the horse to picket in the\ngathering dusk, the ranchero had his arm around the vaquero’s neck, and\nI felt that the old matchmaker would soon be in possession of the\nfacts. A hilarious guffaw that reached me as I was picketing my horse\nannounced that the story was out, and as the two returned to the fire\nUncle Lance was slapping Enrique on the back at every step and calling\nhim a lucky dog. The news spread through the camp like wild-fire, even\nto the vaqueros on night herd, who instantly began chanting an old love\nsong. While Enrique and I were eating our supper, our employer paced\nbackward and forward in meditation like a sentinel on picket, and when\nwe had finished our meal, he joined us around the fire, inquiring of\nEnrique how soon the demand should be made for the corporal’s daughter,\nand was assured that it could not be done too soon. “The padre only\ncame once a year,” he concluded, “and they must be ready.”\n\n“Well, now, this is a pretty pickle,” said the old matchmaker, as he\npulled his gray mustaches; “there isn’t pen or paper in the outfit. And\nthen we’ll be busy branding on the home range for a month, and I can’t\nspare a vaquero a day to carry a letter to Santa Maria. And besides, I\nmight not be at home when the reply came. I think I’ll just take the\nbull by the horns; ride back in the morning and set these old\nprecedents at defiance, by arranging the match verbally. I can make the\ntalk that this country is Texas now, and that under the new regime\nAmerican customs are in order. That’s what I’ll do—and I’ll take Tom\nQuirk with me for fear I bog down in my Spanish.”\n\nBut several vaqueros, who understood some English, advised Enrique of\nwhat the old matchmaker proposed to do, when the vaquero threw his\nhands in the air and began sputtering Spanish in terrified disapproval.\nDid not Don Lance know that the marriage usages among his people were\ntheir most cherished customs? “Oh, yes, son,” languidly replied Uncle\nLance. “I’m some strong on the cherish myself, but not when it\ninterferes with my plans. It strikes me that less than a month ago I\nheard you condemning to perdition certain customs of your people. Now,\ndon’t get on too high a horse—just leave it to Tom and me. We may stay\na week, but when we come back we’ll bring your betrothal with us in our\nvest pockets. There was never a Mexican born who can outhold me on\npalaver; and we’ll eat every chicken on Santa Maria unless they\nsurrender.”\n\nAs soon as the herd had started for home the next morning, Uncle Lance\nand I returned to Santa Maria. We were extended a cordial reception by\nDon Mateo, and after the chronicle of happenings since the two\nrancheros last met had been reviewed, the motive of our sudden return\nwas mentioned. By combining the vocabularies of my employer and myself,\nwe mentioned our errand as delicately as possible, pleading guilty and\ncraving every one’s pardon for our rudeness in verbally conducting the\nnegotiations. To our surprise,—for to Mexicans customs are as rooted as\nFaith,—Don Mateo took no offense and summoned Doña Gregoria. I was\nplaying a close second to the diplomat of our side of the house, and\nwhen his Spanish failed him and he had recourse to English, it is\nneedless to say I handled matters to the best of my ability. The\nSpanish is a musical, passionate language and well suited to love\nmaking, and though this was my first use of it for that purpose, within\nhalf an hour we had won the ranchero and his wife to our side of the\nquestion.\n\nThen, at Don Mateo’s orders, the parents of the girl were summoned.\nThis involved some little delay, which permitted coffee being served,\nand discussion, over the cigarettes, of the commonplace matters of the\ncountry. There was beginning to be a slight demand for cattle to drive\nto the far north on the trails, some thought it was the sign of a big\ndevelopment, but neither of the rancheros put much confidence in the\nmovement, etc., etc. The corporal and his wife suddenly made their\nappearance, dressed in their best, which accounted for the delay, and\nall cattle conversation instantly ceased. Uncle Lance arose and greeted\nthe husky corporal and his timid wife with warm cordiality. I extended\nmy greetings to the Mexican foreman, whom I had met at the rodeo about\na month before. We then resumed our seats, but the corporal and his\nwife remained standing, and with an elegant command of his native\ntongue Don Mateo informed the couple of our mission. They looked at\neach other in bewilderment. Tears came into the wife’s eyes. For a\nmoment I pitied her. Indeed, the pathetic was not lacking. But the\nhearty corporal reminded his better half that her parents, in his\ninterests, had once been asked for her hand under similar\ncircumstances, and the tears disappeared. Tears are womanly; and I have\nsince seen them shed, under less provocation, by fairer-skinned women\nthan this simple, swarthy daughter of Mexico.\n\nIt was but natural that the parents of the girl should feign surprise\nand reluctance if they did not feel it. The Doña Anita’s mother offered\nseveral trivial objections. Her daughter had never taken her into her\nconfidence over any suitor. And did Anita really love Enrique Lopez of\nLas Palomas? Even if she did, could he support her, being but a\nvaquero? This brought Uncle Lance to the front. He had known Enrique\nsince the day of his birth. As a five-year-old, and naked as the day he\nwas born, had he not ridden a colt at branding time, twice around the\nbig corral without being thrown? At ten, had he not thrown himself\nacross a gateway and allowed a _caballada_ of over two hundred wild\nrange horses to jump over his prostrate body as they passed in a\nheadlong rush through the gate? Only the year before at branding, when\nan infuriated bull had driven every vaquero out of the corrals, did not\nEnrique mount his horse, and, after baiting the bull out into the open,\nplay with him like a kitten with a mouse? And when the bull, tiring,\nattempted to make his escape, who but Enrique had lassoed the animal by\nthe fore feet, breaking his neck in the throw? The diplomat of Las\nPalomas dejectedly admitted that the bull was a prize animal, but could\nnot deny that he himself had joined in the plaudits to the daring\nvaquero. But if there were a possible doubt that the Doña Anita did not\nlove this son of Las Palomas, then Lance Lovelace himself would oppose\nthe union. This was an important matter. Would Don Mateo be so kind as\nto summon the señorita?\n\nThe señorita came in response to the summons. She was a girl of\npossibly seventeen summers, several inches taller than her mother,\npossessing a beautiful complexion with large lustrous eyes. There was\nsomething fawnlike in her timidity as she gazed at those about the\ntable. Doña Gregoria broke the news, informing her that the ranchero of\nLas Palomas had asked her hand in marriage for Enrique, one of his\nvaqueros. Did she love the man and was she willing to marry him? For\nreply the girl hid her face in the mantilla of her mother. With\ncommendable tact Doña Gregoria led the mother and daughter into another\nroom, from which the two elder women soon returned with a favorable\nreply. Uncle Lance arose and assured the corporal and his wife that\ntheir daughter would receive his special care and protection; that as\nlong as water ran and grass grew, Las Palomas would care for her own\nchildren.\n\nWe accepted an invitation to remain for dinner, as several hours had\nelapsed since our arrival. In company with the corporal, I attended to\nour horses, leaving the two rancheros absorbed in a discussion of Texas\nfever, rumors of which were then attracting widespread attention in the\nnorth along the cattle trails. After dinner we took our leave of host\nand hostess, promising to send Enrique to Santa Maria at the earliest\nopportunity.\n\nIt was a long ride across country to Las Palomas, but striking a free\ngait, unencumbered as we were, we covered the country rapidly. I had\nsomewhat doubted the old matchmaker’s sincerity in making this match,\nbut as we rode along he told me of his own marriage to Mary Bryan, and\nthe one happy year of life which it brought him, mellowing into a mood\nof seriousness which dispelled all doubts. It was almost sunset when we\nsighted in the distance the ranch buildings at Las Palomas, and half an\nhour later as we galloped up to assist the herd which was nearing the\ncorrals, the old man stood in his stirrups and, waving his hat, shouted\nto his outfit: “Hurrah for Enrique and the Doña Anita!” And as the last\nof the cattle entered the corral, a rain of lassos settled over the\nsmiling rascal and his horse, and we led him in triumph to the house\nfor Miss Jean’s blessing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\nCHRISTMAS\n\n\nThe branding on the home range was an easy matter. The cattle were\ncompelled to water from the Nueces, so that their range was never over\nfive or six miles from the river. There was no occasion even to take\nout the wagon, though we made a one-night camp at the mouth of the\nGanso, and another about midway between the home ranch and Shepherd’s\nFerry, pack mules serving instead of the wagon. On the home range, in\ngathering to brand, we never disturbed the mixed cattle, cutting out\nonly the cows and calves. On the round-up below the Ganso, we had over\nthree thousand cattle in one rodeo, finding less than five hundred\ncalves belonging to Las Palomas, the bulk on this particular occasion\nbeing steer cattle. There had been little demand for steers for several\nseasons and they had accumulated until many of them were fine beeves,\nfive and six years old.\n\nWhen the branding proper was concluded, our tally showed nearly\nfifty-one hundred calves branded that season, indicating about twenty\nthousand cattle in the Las Palomas brand. After a week’s rest, with\nfresh horses, we re-rode the home range in squads of two, and branded\nany calves we found with a running iron. This added nearly a hundred\nmore to our original number. On an open range like ours, it was not\nexpected that everything would be branded; but on quitting, it is safe\nto say we had missed less than one per cent of our calf crop.\n\nThe cattle finished, we turned our attention to the branding of the\nhorse stock. The Christmas season was approaching, and we wanted to get\nthe work well in hand for the usual holiday festivities. There were\nsome fifty _manadas_ of mares belonging to Las Palomas, about one\nfourth of which were used for the rearing of mules, the others growing\nour saddle horses for ranch use. These bands numbered twenty to\ntwenty-five brood mares each, and ranged mostly within twenty miles of\nthe home ranch. They were never disturbed except to brand the colts,\nmarket surplus stock, or cut out the mature geldings to be broken for\nsaddle use. Each _manada_ had its own range, never trespassing on\nothers, but when they were brought together in the corral there was\nmany a battle royal among the stallions.\n\nI was anxious to get the work over in good season, for I intended to\nask for a two weeks’ leave of absence. My parents lived near Cibollo\nFord on the San Antonio River, and I made it a rule to spend Christmas\nwith my own people. This year, in particular, I had a double motive in\ngoing home; for the mouth of San Miguel and the McLeod ranch lay\ndirectly on my route. I had figured matters down to a fraction; I would\nhave a good excuse for staying one night going and another returning.\nAnd it would be my fault if I did not reach the ranch at an hour when\nan invitation to remain over night would be simply imperative under the\ncanons of Texas hospitality. I had done enough hard work since the\ndance at Shepherd’s to drive every thought of Esther McLeod out of my\nmind if that were possible, but as the time drew nearer her invitation\nto call was ever uppermost in my thoughts.\n\nSo when the last of the horse stock was branded and the work was\ndrawing to a close, as we sat around the fireplace one night and the\nquestion came up where each of us expected to spend Christmas, I\nbroached my plan. The master and mistress were expected at the Booth\nranch on the Frio. Nearly all the boys, who had homes within two or\nthree days’ ride, hoped to improve the chance to make a short visit to\ntheir people. When, among the others, I also made my application for\nleave of absence, Uncle Lance turned in his chair with apparent\nsurprise. “What’s that? You want to go home? Well, now, that’s a new\none on me. Why, Tom, I never knew you had any folks; I got the idea,\nsomehow, that you was won on a horse race. Here I had everything\nfigured out to send you down to Santa Maria with Enrique. But I reckon\nwith the ice broken, he’ll have to swim out or drown. Where do your\nfolks live?” I explained that they lived on the San Antonio River,\nnortheast about one hundred and fifty miles. At this I saw my\nemployer’s face brighten. “Yes, yes, I see,” said he musingly; “that\nwill carry you past the widow McLeod’s. You can go, son, and good luck\nto you.”\n\nI timed my departure from Las Palomas, allowing three days for the\ntrip, so as to reach home on Christmas eve. By making a slight\ndeviation, there was a country store which I could pass on the last\nday, where I expected to buy some presents for my mother and sisters.\nBut I was in a pickle as to what to give Esther, and on consulting Miss\nJean, I found that motherly elder sister had everything thought out in\nadvance. There was an old Mexican woman, a pure Aztec Indian, at a\nranchita belonging to Las Palomas, who was an expert in Mexican drawn\nwork. The mistress of the home ranch had been a good patron of this old\nwoman, and the next morning we drove over to the ranchita, where I\nsecured half a dozen ladies’ handkerchiefs, inexpensive but very rare.\n\nI owned a private horse, which had run idle all summer, and naturally\nexpected to ride him on this trip. But Uncle Lance evidently wanted me\nto make a good impression on the widow McLeod, and brushed my plans\naside, by asking me as a favor to ride a certain black horse belonging\nto his private string. “Quirk,” said he, the evening before my\ndeparture, “I wish you would ride Wolf, that black six-year-old in my\nmount. When that rascal of an Enrique saddle-broke him for me, he\nalways mounted him with a free head and on the move, and now when I use\nhim he’s always on the fidget. So you just ride him over to the San\nAntonio and back, and see if you can’t cure him of that restlessness.\nIt may be my years, but I just despise a horse that’s always dancing a\njig when I want to mount him.”\n\nGlenn Gallup’s people lived in Victoria County, about as far from Las\nPalomas as mine, and the next morning we set out down the river. Our\ncourse together only led a short distance, but we jogged along until\nnoon, when we rested an hour and parted, Glenn going on down the river\nfor Oakville, while I turned almost due north across country for the\nmouth of San Miguel. The black carried me that afternoon as though the\nsaddle was empty. I was constrained to hold him in, in view of the long\njourney before us, so as not to reach the McLeod ranch too early.\nWhenever we struck cattle on our course, I rode through them to pass\naway the time, and just about sunset I cantered up to the McLeod ranch\nwith a dash. I did not know a soul on the place, but put on a bold\nfront and asked for Miss Esther. On catching sight of me, she gave a\nlittle start, blushed modestly, and greeted me cordially.\n\nTexas hospitality of an early day is too well known to need comment; I\nwas at once introduced to the McLeod household. It was rather a\npretentious ranch, somewhat dilapidated in appearance—appearances are\nas deceitful on a cattle ranch as in the cut of a man’s coat. Tony\nHunter, a son-in-law of the widow, was foreman on the ranch, and during\nthe course of the evening in the discussion of cattle matters, I\ninnocently drew out the fact that their branded calf crop of that\nseason amounted to nearly three thousand calves. When a similar\nquestion was asked me, I reluctantly admitted that the Las Palomas crop\nwas quite a disappointment this year, only branding sixty-five hundred\ncalves, but that our mule and horse colts ran nearly a thousand head\nwithout equals in the Nueces valley.\n\nI knew there was no one there who could dispute my figures, though Mrs.\nMcLeod expressed surprise at them. “Ye dinna say,” said my hostess,\nlooking directly at me over her spectacles, “that Las Palomas branded\nthat mony calves thi’ year? Why, durin’ ma gudeman’s life we alway\nbranded mair calves than did Mr. Lovelace. But then my husband would\njoin the army, and I had tae depend on greasers tae do ma work, and oor\nkye grew up mavericks.” I said nothing in reply, knowing it to be quite\nnatural for a woman or inexperienced person to feel always the prey of\nthe fortunate and far-seeing.\n\nThe next morning before leaving, I managed to have a nice private talk\nwith Miss Esther, and thought I read my title clear, when she surprised\nme with the information that her mother contemplated sending her off to\nSan Antonio to a private school for young ladies. Her two elder sisters\nhad married against her mother’s wishes, it seemed, and Mrs. McLeod was\ndetermined to give her youngest daughter an education and fit her for\nsomething better than being the wife of a common cow hand. This was the\ninference from the conversation which passed between us at the gate.\nBut when Esther thanked me for the Christmas remembrance I had brought\nher, I felt that I would take a chance on her, win or lose. Assuring\nher that I would make it a point to call on my return, I gave the black\na free rein and galloped out of sight.\n\nI reached home late on Christmas eve. My two elder brothers, who also\nfollowed cattle work, had arrived the day before, and the Quirk family\nwere once more united, for the first time in two years. Within an hour\nafter my arrival, I learned from my brothers that there was to be a\ndance that night at a settlement about fifteen miles up the river. They\nwere going, and it required no urging on their part to insure the\npresence of Quirk’s three boys. Supper over, a fresh horse was\nfurnished me, and we set out for the dance, covering the distance in\nless than two hours. I knew nearly every one in the settlement, and got\na cordial welcome. I played the fiddle, danced with my former\nsweethearts, and, ere the sun rose in the morning, rode home in time\nfor breakfast. During that night’s revelry, I contrasted my former girl\nfriends on the San Antonio with another maiden, a slip of the old\nScotch stock, transplanted and nurtured in the sunshine and soil of the\nSan Miguel. The comparison stood all tests applied, and in my secret\nheart I knew who held the whip hand over the passions within me.\n\nAs I expected to return to Las Palomas for the New Year, my time was\nlimited to a four days’ visit at home. But a great deal can be said in\nfour days; and at the end I was ready to saddle my black, bid my\nadieus, and ride for the southwest. During my visit I was careful not\nto betray that I had even a passing thought of a sweetheart, and what\nparents would suspect that a rollicking, carefree young fellow of\ntwenty could have any serious intentions toward a girl? With brothers\ntoo indifferent, and sisters too young, the secret was my own, though\nWolf, my mount, as he put mile after mile behind us, seemed conscious\nthat his mission to reach the San Miguel without loss of time was of\nmore than ordinary moment. And a better horse never carried knight in\nthe days of chivalry.\n\nOn reaching the McLeod ranch during the afternoon of the second day, I\nfound Esther expectant; but the welcome of her mother was of a frigid\norder. Having a Scotch mother myself, I knew something of arbitrary\nnatures, and met Mrs. McLeod’s coolness with a fund of talk and\nstories; yet I could see all too plainly that she was determinedly on\nthe defensive. I had my favorite fiddle with me which I was taking back\nto Las Palomas, and during the evening I played all the old Scotch\nballads I knew and love songs of the highlands, hoping to soften her\nfrom the decided stand she had taken against me and my intentions. But\nher heritage of obstinacy was large, and her opposition strong, as\nseveral well-directed thrusts which reached me in vulnerable places\nmade me aware, but I smiled as if they were flattering compliments.\nSeveral times I mentally framed replies only to smother them, for I was\nthe stranger within her gates, and if she saw fit to offend a guest she\nwas still within her rights.\n\nBut the next morning as I tarried beyond the reasonable hour for my\ndeparture, her wrath broke out in a torrent. “If ye dinna ken the way\nhame, Mr. Quirk, I’ll show it ye,” she said as she joined Esther and me\nat the hitch-rack, where we had been loitering for an hour. “And I\ndinna care muckle whaur ye gang, so ye get oot o’ ma sight, and stay\noot o’ it. I thocht ye waur a ceevil stranger when ye bided wi’ us last\nweek, but noo I ken ye are something mair, ridin’ your fine horses an’\nmakin’ presents tae ma lassie. That’s a’ the guid that comes o’ lettin’\nher rin tae every dance at Shepherd’s Ferry. Gang ben the house tae\nyour wark, ye jade, an’ let me attend tae this fine gentleman. Noo,\nsir, gin ye ony business onywhaur else, ye ’d aye better be ridin’ tae\nit, for ye are no wanted here, ye ken.”\n\n“Why, Mrs. McLeod,” I broke in politely. “You hardly know anything\nabout me.”\n\n“No, an’ I dinna wish it. You are frae Las Palomas, an’ that’s aye\nenough for me. I ken auld Lance Lovelace, an’ those that bide wi’ him.\nSma’ wonder he brands sae mony calves and sells mair kye than a’ the\nither ranchmen in the country. Ay, man, I ken him well.”\n\nI saw that I had a tartar to deal with, but if I could switch her\ninvective on some one absent, it would assist me in controlling myself.\nSo I said to the old lady: “Why, I’ve known Mr. Lovelace now almost a\nyear, and over on the Nueces he is well liked, and considered a cowman\nwhose word is as good as gold. What have you got against him?”\n\n“Ower much, ma young freend. I kent him afore ye were born. I’m sorry\ntae say that while ma gudeman was alive, he was a frequent visitor at\noor place. But we dinna see him ony mair. He aye keeps awa’ frae here,\nand camps wi’ his wagons when he’s ower on the San Miguel to gather\ncattle. He was no content merely wi’ what kye drifted doon on the\nNueces, but warked a big outfit the year around, e’en comin’ ower on\nthe Frio an’ San Miguel maverick huntin’. That’s why he brands twice\nthe calves that onybody else does, and owns a forty-mile front o’ land\non both sides o’ the river. Ye see, I ken him weel.”\n\n“Well, isn’t that the way most cowmen got their start?” I innocently\ninquired, well knowing it was. “And do you blame him for running his\nbrand on the unowned cattle that roamed the range? I expect if Mr.\nLovelace was my father instead of my employer, you wouldn’t be talking\nin the same key,” and with that I led my horse out to mount.\n\n“Ye think a great deal o’ yersel’, because ye’re frae Las Palomas.\nAweel, no vaquero of auld Lance Lovelace can come sparkin’ wi’ ma lass.\nI’ve heard o’ auld Lovelace’s matchmaking. I’m told he mak’s matches\nand then laughs at the silly gowks. I’ve twa worthless sons-in-law the\nnoo, are here an’ anither a stage-driver. Aye, they’re capital husbands\nfor Donald McLeod’s lassies, are they no? Afore I let Esther marry the\nfirst scamp that comes simperin’ aroond here, I’ll put her in a\nconvent, an’ mak’ a nun o’ the bairn. I gave the ither lassies their\nway, an’ look at the reward. I tell ye I’m goin’ to bar the door on the\nlast one, an’ the man that marries her will be worthy o’ her. He winna\nbe a vaquero frae Las Palomas either!”\n\nI had mounted my horse to start, well knowing it was useless to argue\nwith an angry woman. Esther had obediently retreated to the safety of\nthe house, aware that her mother had a tongue and evidently willing to\nbe spared its invective in my presence. My horse was fidgeting about,\nimpatient to be off, but I gave him the rowel and rode up to the gate,\ndetermined, if possible, to pour oil on the troubled waters. “Mrs.\nMcLeod,” said I, in humble tones, “possibly you take the correct view\nof this matter. Miss Esther and I have only been acquainted a few\nmonths, and will soon forget each other. Please take me in the house\nand let me tell her good-by.”\n\n“No, sir. Dinna set foot inside o’ this gate. I hope ye know ye’re no\nwanted here. There’s your road, the one leadin’ south, an’ ye’d better\nbe goin’, I’m thinkin’.”\n\nI held in the black and rode off in a walk. This was the first clean\nknock-out I had ever met. Heretofore I had been egotistical enough to\nhold my head rather high, but this morning it drooped. Wolf seemed to\nnotice it, and after the first mile dropped into an easy volunteer\nwalk. I never noticed the passing of time until we reached the river,\nand the black stopped to drink. Here I unsaddled for several hours;\nthen went on again in no cheerful mood. Before I came within sight of\nLas Palomas near evening, my horse turned his head and nickered, and in\na few minutes Uncle Lance and June Deweese galloped up and overtook me.\nI had figured out several very plausible versions of my adventure, but\nthis sudden meeting threw me off my guard—and Lance Lovelace was a hard\nman to tell an undetected, white-faced lie. I put on a bold front, but\nhis salutation penetrated it at a glance.\n\n“What’s the matter, Tom; any of your folks dead?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Sick?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Girl gone back on you?”\n\n“I don’t think.”\n\n“It’s the old woman, then?”\n\n“How do you know?”\n\n“Because I know that old dame. I used to go over there occasionally\nwhen old man Donald was living, but the old lady—excuse me! I ought to\nhave posted you, Tom, but I don’t suppose it would have done any good.\nBrought your fiddle with you, I see. That’s good. I expect the old lady\nread my title clear to you.”\n\nMy brain must have been under a haze, for I repeated every charge she\nhad made against him, not even sparing the accusation that he had\nremained out of the army and added to his brand by mavericking cattle.\n\n“Did she say that?” inquired Uncle Lance, laughing. “Why, the old\nhellion! She must have been feeling in fine fettle!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\nA PIGEON HUNT\n\n\nThe new year dawned on Las Palomas rich in promise of future content.\nUncle Lance and I had had a long talk the evening before, and under the\nreasoning of the old optimist the gloom gradually lifted from my\nspirits. I was glad I had been so brutally blunt that evening,\nregarding what Mrs. McLeod had said about him; for it had a tendency to\nincrease the rancher’s aggressiveness in my behalf. “Hell, Tom,” said\nthe old man, as we walked from the corrals to the house, “don’t let a\nlittle thing like this disturb you. Of course she’ll four-flush and\nbluff you if she can, but you don’t want to pay any more attention to\nthe old lady than if she was some _pelado_. To be sure, it would be\nbetter to have her consent, but then”—\n\nGlenn Gallup also arrived at the ranch on New Year’s eve. He brought\nthe report that wild pigeons were again roosting at the big bend of the\nriver. It was a well-known pigeon roost, but the birds went to other\nwinter feeding grounds, except during years when there was a plentiful\nsweet mast. This bend was about midway between the ranch and\nShepherd’s, contained about two thousand acres, and was heavily\ntimbered with ash, pecan, and hackberry. The feeding grounds lay\ndistant, extending from the encinal ridges on the Las Palomas lands to\nlive-oak groves a hundred miles to the southward. But however far the\npigeons might go for food, they always returned to the roosting place\nat night.\n\n“That means pigeon pie,” said Uncle Lance, on receiving Glenn’s report.\n“Everybody and the cook can go. We only have a sweet mast about every\nthree or four years in the encinal, but it always brings the wild\npigeons. We’ll take a couple of pack mules and the little and the big\npot and the two biggest Dutch ovens on the ranch. Oh, you got to\nparboil a pigeon if you want a tender pie. Next to a fish fry, a good\npigeon pie makes the finest eating going. I’ve made many a one, and I\ngive notice right now that the making of the pie falls to me or I won’t\nplay. And another thing, not a bird shall be killed more than we can\nuse. Of course we’ll bring home a mess, and a few apiece for the\nMexicans.”\n\nWe had got up our horses during the forenoon, and as soon as dinner was\nover the white contingent saddled up and started for the roost.\nTiburcio and Enrique accompanied us, and, riding leisurely, we reached\nthe bend several hours before the return of the birds. The roost had\nbeen in use but a short time, but as we scouted through the timber\nthere was abundant evidence of an immense flight of pigeons. The ground\nwas literally covered with feathers; broken limbs hung from nearly\nevery tree, while in one instance a forked hackberry had split from the\nweight of the birds.\n\nWe made camp on the outskirts of the timber, and at early dusk great\nflocks of pigeons began to arrive at their roosting place. We only had\nfour shotguns, and, dividing into pairs, we entered the roost shortly\nafter dark. Glenn Gallup fell to me as my pardner. I carried the gunny\nsack for the birds, not caring for a gun in such unfair shooting. The\nflights continued to arrive for fully an hour after we entered the\nroost, and in half a dozen shots we bagged over fifty birds.\nRemembering the admonition of Uncle Lance, Gallup refused to kill more,\nand we sat down and listened to the rumbling noises of the grove. There\nwas a constant chattering of the pigeons, and as they settled in great\nflights in the trees overhead, whipping the branches with their wings\nin search of footing, they frequently fell to the ground at our feet.\n\nGallup and I returned to camp early. Before we had skinned our kill the\nothers had all come in, disgusted with the ease with which they had\nfilled their bags. We soon had two pots filled and on the fire\nparboiling, while Tiburcio lined two ovens with pastry, all ready for\nthe baking. In a short time two horsemen, attracted by our fire,\ncrossed the river below our camp and rode up.\n\n“Hello, Uncle Lance,” lustily shouted one of them, as he dismounted.\n“It’s you, is it, that’s shooting my pigeons? All right, sir, I’ll stay\nall night and help you eat them. I had figured on riding back to the\nFrio to-night, but I’ve changed my mind. Got any horse hobbles here?”\nThe two men, George Nathan and Hugh Trotter, were accommodated with\nhobbles, and after an exchange of commonplace news of the country, we\nsettled down to story-telling. Trotter was a convivial acquaintance of\nAaron Scales, quite a vagabond and consequently a story-teller. After\nTrotter had narrated a late dream, Scales unlimbered and told one of\nhis own.\n\n“I remember a dream I had several years ago, and the only way I can\naccount for it was, I had been drinking more or less during the day. I\ndreamt I was making a long ride across a dreary desert, and towards\nnight it threatened a bad storm. I began to look around for some\nshelter. I could just see the tops of a clump of trees beyond a hill,\nand rode hard to get to them, thinking that there might be a house\namongst them. How I did ride! But I certainly must have had a poor\nhorse, for I never seemed to get any nearer that timber. I rode and\nrode, but all this time, hours and hours it seemed, and the storm\ngathering and scattering raindrops falling, the timber seemed scarcely\nany nearer.\n\n“At last I managed to reach the crest of the hill. Well, sir, there\nwasn’t a tree in sight, only, under the brow of the hill, a deserted\nadobe _jacal_, and I rode for that, picketed my horse and went in. The\n_jacal_ had a thatched roof with several large holes in it, and in the\nfireplace burned a roaring fire. That was some strange, but I didn’t\nmind it and I was warming my hands before the fire and congratulating\nmyself on my good luck, when a large black cat sprang from the outside\ninto an open window, and said: ‘Pardner, it looks like a bad night\noutside.’\n\n“I eyed him a little suspiciously; but, for all that, if he hadn’t\nspoken, I wouldn’t have thought anything about it, for I like cats. He\nwalked backward and forward on the window sill, his spine and tail\nnicely arched, and rubbed himself on either window jamb. I watched him\nsome little time, and finally concluded to make friends with him. Going\nover to the window, I put out my hand to stroke his glossy back, when a\ngust of rain came through the window and the cat vanished into the\ndarkness.\n\n“I went back to the fire, pitying the cat out there in the night’s\nstorm, and was really sorry I had disturbed him. I didn’t give the\nmatter overmuch attention but sat before the fire, wondering who could\nhave built it and listening to the rain outside, when all of a sudden\nMr. Cat walked between my legs, rubbing himself against my boots,\npurring and singing. Once or twice I thought of stroking his fur, but\nchecked myself on remembering he had spoken to me on the window sill.\nHe would walk over and rub himself against the jambs of the fireplace,\nand then come back and rub himself against my boots friendly like. I\nsaw him just as clear as I see those pots on the fire or these saddles\nlying around here. I was noting every move of his as he meandered\naround, when presently he cocked up an eye at me and remarked: ‘Old\nsport, this is a fine fire we have here.’\n\n“I was beginning to feel a little creepy, for I’d seen mad dogs and\nskunks, and they say a cat gets locoed likewise, and the cuss was\ntalking so cleverly that I began to lose my regard for him. After a\nlittle while I concluded to pet him, for he didn’t seem a bit afraid;\nbut as I put out my hand to catch him, he nimbly hopped into the\nroaring fire and vanished. Then I did feel foolish. I had a good\nsix-shooter, and made up my mind if he showed up again I’d plug him one\nfor luck. I was growing sleepy, and it was getting late, so I concluded\nto spread down my saddle blankets and slicker before the fire and go to\nsleep. While I was making down my bed, I happened to look towards the\nfire, when there was my black cat, with not even a hair singed. I drew\nmy gun quietly and cracked away at him, when he let out the funniest\nlittle laugh, saying: ‘You’ve been drinking, Aaron; you’re nervous; you\ncouldn’t hit a flock of barns.’\n\n“I was getting excited by this time, and cut loose on him rapidly, but\nhe dodged every shot, jumping from the hearth to the mantel, from the\nmantel to an old table, from there to a niche in the wall, and from the\nniche clear across the room and out of the window. About then I was\nsome nervous, and after a while lay down before the fire and tried to\ngo to sleep.\n\n“It was a terrible night outside—one of those nights when you can hear\nthings; and with the vivid imagination I was enjoying then, I was\nalmost afraid to try to sleep. But just as I was going into a doze, I\nraised up my head, and there was my cat walking up and down my frame,\nhis back arched and his tail flirting with the slow sinuous movement of\na snake. I reached for my gun, and as it clicked in cocking, he began\nraking my legs, sharpening his claws and growling like a tiger. I gave\na yell and kicked him off, when he sprang up on the old table and I\ncould see his eyes glaring at me. I emptied my gun at him a second\ntime, and at every shot he crouched lower and crept forward as if\ngetting ready to spring. When I had fired the last shot I jumped up and\nran out into the rain, and hadn’t gone more than a hundred yards before\nI fell into a dry wash. When I crawled out there was that d——d cat\nrubbing himself against my boot leg. I stood breathless for a minute,\nthinking what next to do, and the cat remarked: ‘Wasn’t that a peach of\na race we just had!’\n\n“I made one or two vicious kicks at him and he again vanished. Well,\nfellows, in that dream I walked around that old _jacal_ all night in my\nshirt sleeves, and it raining pitchforks. A number of times I peeped in\nthrough the window or door, and there sat the cat on the hearth, in\nfull possession of the shack, and me out in the weather. Once when I\nlooked in he was missing, but while I was watching he sprang through a\nhole in the roof, alighting in the fire, from which he walked out\ngingerly, shaking his feet as if he had just been out in the wet. I\nshot away every cartridge I had at him, but in the middle of the\nshooting he would just coil up before the fire and snooze away.\n\n“That night was an eternity of torment to me, and I was relieved when\nsome one knocked on the door, and I awoke to find myself in a good bed\nand pounding my ear on a goose-hair pillow in a hotel in Oakville. Why,\nI wouldn’t have another dream like that for a half interest in the Las\nPalomas brand. No, honest, if I thought drinking gave me that hideous\ndream, here would be one lad ripe for reform.”\n\n“It strikes me,” said Uncle Lance, rising and lifting a pot lid, “that\nthese birds are parboiled by this time. Bring me a fork, Enrique. Well,\nI should say they were. I hope hell ain’t any hotter than that fire.\nNow, Tiburcio, if you have everything ready, we’ll put them in the\noven, and bake them a couple of hours.”\n\nSeveral of us assisted in fixing the fire and properly coaling the\novens. When this had been attended to, and we had again resumed our\neasy positions around the fire, Trotter remarked: “Aaron, you ought to\ncut drinking out of your amusements; you haven’t the constitution to\nstand it. Now with me it’s different. I can drink a week and never\nsleep; that’s the kind of a build to have if you expect to travel and\nmeet all comers. Last year I was working for a Kansas City man on the\ntrail, and after the cattle were delivered about a hundred miles\nbeyond,—Ellsworth, up in Kansas,—he sent us home by way of Kansas City.\nIn fact, that was about the only route we could take. Well, it was a\nsuccessful trip, and as this man was plum white, anyhow, he concluded\nto show us the sights around his burg. He was interested in a\ncommission firm out at the stockyards, and the night we reached there\nall the office men, including the old man himself, turned themselves\nloose to show us a good time.\n\n“We had been drinking alkali water all summer, and along about midnight\nthey began to drop out until there was no one left to face the music\nexcept a little cattle salesman and myself. After all the others quit\nus, we went into a feed trough on a back street, and had a good supper.\nI had been drinking everything like a good fellow, and at several\nplaces there was no salt to put in the beer. The idea struck me that I\nwould buy a sack of salt from this eating ranch and take it with me.\nThe landlord gave me a funny look, but after some little parley went to\nthe rear and brought out a five-pound sack of table salt.\n\n“It was just what I wanted, and after paying for it the salesman and I\nstarted out to make a night of it. This yard man was a short, fat\nDutchman, and we made a team for your whiskers. I carried the sack of\nsalt under my arm, and the quantity of beer we killed before daylight\nwas a caution. About daybreak, the salesman wanted me to go to our\nhotel and go to bed, but as I never drink and sleep at the same time, I\ndeclined. Finally he explained to me that he would have to be at the\nyards at eight o’clock, and begged me to excuse him. By this time he\nwas several sheets in the wind, while I could walk a chalk line without\na waver. Somehow we drifted around to the hotel where the outfit were\nsupposed to be stopping, and lined up at the bar for a final drink. It\nwas just daybreak, and between that Dutch cattle salesman and the\nbarkeeper and myself, it would have taken a bookkeeper to have kept a\ncheck on the drinks we consumed—every one the last.\n\n“Then the Dutchman gave me the slip and was gone, and I wandered into\nthe office of the hotel. A newsboy sold me a paper, and the next minute\na bootblack wanted to give me a shine. Well, I took a seat for a shine,\nand for two hours I sat there as full as a tick, and as dignified as a\njudge on the bench. All the newsboys and bootblacks caught on, and\nbefore any of the outfit showed up that morning to rescue me, I had\nbought a dozen papers and had my boots shined for the tenth time. If\nI’d been foxy enough to have got rid of that sack of salt, no one could\nhave told I was off the reservation; but there it was under my arm. If\never I make another trip over the trail, and touch at Kansas City\nreturning, I’ll hunt up that cattle salesman, for he’s the only man I\never met that can pace in my class.”\n\n“Did you hear that tree break a few minutes ago?” inquired Mr. Nathan.\n“There goes another one. It hardly looks possible that enough pigeons\ncould settle on a tree to break it down. Honestly, I’d give a purty to\nknow how many birds are in that roost to-night. More than there are\ncattle in Texas, I’ll bet. Why, Hugh killed, with both barrels,\ntwenty-two at one shot.”\n\nWe had brought blankets along, but it was early and no one thought of\nsleeping for an hour yet. Mr. Nathan was quite a sportsman, and after\nhe and Uncle Lance had discussed the safest method of hunting\n_javalina_, it again devolved on the boys to entertain the party with\nstories.\n\n“I was working on a ranch once,” said Glenn Gallup, “out on the Concho\nRiver. It was a stag outfit, there being few women then out Concho way.\nOne day two of the boys were riding in home when an accident occurred.\nThey had been shooting more or less during the morning, and one of\nthem, named Bill Cook, had carelessly left the hammer of his\nsix-shooter on a cartridge. As Bill jumped his horse over a dry\n_arroyo_, his pistol was thrown from its holster, and, falling on the\nhard ground, was discharged. The bullet struck him in the ankle, ranged\nupward, shattering the large bone in his leg into fragments, and\nfinally lodged in the saddle.\n\n“They were about five miles from camp when the accident happened. After\nthey realized how bad he was hurt, Bill remounted his horse and rode\nnearly a mile; but the wound bled so then that the fellow with him\ninsisted on his getting off and lying on the ground while he went into\nthe ranch for a wagon. Well, it’s to be supposed that he lost no time\nriding in, and I was sent to San Angelo for a doctor. It was just noon\nwhen I got off. I had to ride thirty miles. Talk about your good\nhorses—I had one that day. I took a free gait from the start, but the\nlast ten miles was the fastest, for I covered the entire distance in\nless than three hours. There was a doctor in the town who’d been on the\nfrontier all of his life, and was used to such calls. Well, before dark\nthat evening we drove into the ranch.\n\n“They had got the lad into the ranch, had checked the flow of blood and\neased the pain by standing on a chair and pouring water on the wound\nfrom a height. But Bill looked pale as a ghost from the loss of blood.\nThe doctor gave the leg a single look, and, turning to us, said: ‘Boys,\nshe has to come off.’\n\n“The doctor talked to Bill freely and frankly, telling him that it was\nthe only chance for his life. He readily consented to the operation,\nand while the doctor was getting him under the influence of opiates we\nfixed up an operating table. When all was ready, the doctor took the\nleg off below the knee, cursing us generally for being so sensitive to\ncutting and the sight of blood. There was quite a number of boys at the\nranch, but it affected them all alike. It was interesting to watch him\ncut and tie arteries and saw the bones, and I think I stood it better\nthan any of them. When the operation was over, we gave the fellow the\nbest bed the ranch afforded and fixed him up comfortable. The doctor\ntook the bloody stump and wrapped it up in an old newspaper, saying he\nwould take it home with him.\n\n“After supper the surgeon took a sleep, saying we would start back to\ntown by two o’clock, so as to be there by daylight. He gave\ninstructions to call him in case Bill awoke, but he hoped the boy would\ntake a good sleep. As I had left my horse in town, I was expected to go\nback with him. Shortly after midnight the fellow awoke, so we aroused\nthe doctor, who reported him doing well. The old Doc sat by his bed for\nan hour and told him all kinds of stories. He had been a surgeon in the\nConfederate army, and from the drift of his talk you’d think it was\nimpossible to kill a man without cutting off his head.\n\n“‘Now take a young fellow like you,’ said the doctor to his patient,\n‘if he was all shot to pieces, just so the parts would hang together, I\ncould fix him up and he would get well. You have no idea, son, how much\nlead a young man can carry.’ We had coffee and lunch before starting,\nthe doctor promising to send me back at once with necessary medicines.\n\n“We had a very pleasant trip driving back to town that night. The\nstories he could tell were like a song with ninety verses, no two\nalike. It was hardly daybreak when we reached San Angelo, rustled out a\nsleepy hostler at the livery stable where the team belonged, and had\nthe horses cared for; and as we left the stable the doctor gave me his\ninstrument case, while he carried the amputated leg in the paper. We\nboth felt the need of a bracer after our night’s ride, so we looked\naround to see if any saloons were open. There was only one that showed\nany signs of life, and we headed for that. The doctor was in the lead\nas we entered, and we both knew the barkeeper well. This barkeeper was\na practical joker himself, and he and the doctor were great hunting\ncompanions. We walked up to the bar together, when the doctor laid the\npackage on the counter and asked: ‘Is this good for two drinks?’ The\nbarkeeper, with a look of expectation in his face as if the package\nmight contain half a dozen quail or some fresh fish, broke the string\nand unrolled it. Without a word he walked straight from behind the bar\nand out of the house. If he had been shot himself he couldn’t have\nlooked whiter.\n\n“The doctor went behind the bar and said: ‘Glenn, what are you going to\ntake?’ ‘Let her come straight, doctor,’ was my reply, and we both took\nthe same. We had the house all to ourselves, and after a second round\nof drinks took our leave. As we left by the front door, we saw the\nbarkeeper leaning against a hitching post half a block below. The\ndoctor called to him as we were leaving: ‘Billy, if the drinks ain’t on\nyou, charge them to me.’”\n\nThe moon was just rising, and at Uncle Lance’s suggestion we each\ncarried in a turn of wood. Piling a portion of it on the fire, the\nblaze soon lighted up the camp, throwing shafts of light far into the\nrecesses of the woods around us. “In another hour,” said Uncle Lance,\nrecoaling the oven lids, “that smaller pie will be all ready to serve,\nbut we’ll keep the big one for breakfast. So, boys, if you want to sit\nup awhile longer, we’ll have a midnight lunch, and then all turn in for\nabout forty winks.” As the oven lid was removed from time to time to\ntake note of the baking, savory odors of the pie were wafted to our\nanxious nostrils. On the intimation that one oven would be ready in an\nhour, not a man suggested blankets, and, taking advantage of the lull,\nTheodore Quayle claimed attention.\n\n“Another fellow and myself,” said Quayle, “were knocking around Fort\nWorth one time seeing the sights. We had drunk until it didn’t taste\nright any longer. This chum of mine was queer in his drinking. If he\never got enough once, he didn’t want any more for several days: you\ncould cure him by offering him plenty. But with just the right amount\non board, he was a hail fellow. He was a big, ambling, awkward cuss,\nwho could be led into anything on a hint or suggestion. We had been\nknocking around the town for a week, until there was nothing new to be\nseen.\n\n“Several times as we passed a millinery shop, kept by a little blonde,\nwe had seen her standing at the door. Something—it might have been his\nambling walk, but, anyway, something—about my chum amused her, for she\nsmiled and watched him as we passed. He never could walk along beside\nyou for any distance, but would trail behind and look into the windows.\nHe could not be hurried—not in town. I mentioned to him that he had\nmade a mash on the little blond milliner, and he at once insisted that\nI should show her to him. We passed down on the opposite side of the\nstreet and I pointed out the place. Then we walked by several times,\nand finally passed when she was standing in the doorway talking to some\ncustomers. As we came up he straightened himself, caught her eye, and\ntipped his hat with the politeness of a dancing master. She blushed to\nthe roots of her hair, and he walked on very erect some little\ndistance, then we turned a corner and held a confab. He was for playing\nthe whole string, discount or no discount, anyway.\n\n“An excuse to go in was wanting, but we thought we could invent one;\nhowever, he needed a drink or two to facilitate his thinking and loosen\nhis tongue. To get them was easier than the excuse; but with the drinks\nthe motive was born. ‘You wait here,’ said he to me, ‘until I go round\nto the livery stable and get my coat off my saddle.’ He never\nencumbered himself with extra clothing. We had not seen our horses,\nsaddles, or any of our belongings during the week of our visit. When he\nreturned he inquired, ‘Do I need a shave?’\n\n“‘Oh, no,’ I said, ‘you need no shave. You may have a drink too many,\nor lack one of having enough. It’s hard to make a close calculation on\nyou.’\n\n“‘Then I’m all ready,’ said he, ‘for I’ve just the right gauge of\nsteam.’ He led the way as we entered. It was getting dark and the shop\nwas empty of customers. Where he ever got the manners, heaven only\nknows. Once inside the door we halted, and she kept a counter between\nus as she approached. She ought to have called the police and had us\nrun in. She was probably scared, but her voice was fairly steady as she\nspoke. ‘Gentlemen, what can I do for you?’\n\n“‘My friend here,’ said he, with a bow and a wave of the hand, ‘was\nunfortunate enough to lose a wager made between us. The terms of the\nbet were that the loser was to buy a new hat for one of the dining-room\ngirls at our hotel. As we are leaving town to-morrow, we have just\ndropped in to see if you have anything suitable. We are both totally\nincompetent to decide on such a delicate matter, but we will trust\nentirely to your judgment in the selection.’ The milliner was quite\ncollected by this time, as she asked: ‘Any particular style?—and about\nwhat price?’\n\n“‘The price is immaterial,’ said he disdainfully. ‘Any man who will\nwager on the average weight of a train-load of cattle, his own cattle,\nmind you, and miss them twenty pounds, ought to pay for his lack of\njudgment. Don’t you think so, Miss—er—er. Excuse me for being unable to\ncall your name—but—but—’ ‘De Ment is my name,’ said she with some\nlittle embarrassment.\n\n“‘Livingstone is mine,’ said he with a profound bow,’ and this\ngentleman is Mr. Ochiltree, youngest brother of Congressman Tom. Now\nregarding the style, we will depend entirely upon your selection. But\npossibly the loser is entitled to some choice in the matter. Mr.\nOchiltree, have you any preference in regard to style?’\n\n“‘Why, no, I can generally tell whether a hat becomes a lady or not,\nbut as to selecting one I am at sea. We had better depend on Miss De\nMent’s judgment. Still, I always like an abundance of flowers on a\nlady’s hat. Whenever a girl walks down the street ahead of me, I like\nto watch the posies, grass, and buds on her hat wave and nod with the\nmotion of her walk. Miss De Ment, don’t you agree with me that an\nabundance of flowers becomes a young lady? And this girl can’t be over\ntwenty.’\n\n“‘Well, now,’ said she, going into matters in earnest, ‘I can scarcely\nadvise you. Is the young lady a brunette or blonde?’\n\n“‘What difference does that make?’ he innocently asked.\n\n“‘Oh,’ said she, smiling, ‘we must harmonize colors. What would suit\none complexion would not become another. What color is her hair?’\n\n“‘Nearly the color of yours,’ said he. ‘Not so heavy and lacks the\nnatural wave which yours has—but she’s all right. She can ride a string\nof my horses until they all have sore backs. I tell you she is a cute\ntrick. But, say, Miss De Ment, what do you think of a green hat, broad\nbrimmed, turned up behind and on one side, long black feathers run\nround and turned up behind, with a blue bird on the other side swooping\ndown like a pigeon hawk, long tail feathers and an arrow in its beak?\nThat strikes me as about the mustard. What do you think of that kind of\na hat, dear?’\n\n“‘Why, sir, the colors don’t harmonize,’ she replied, blushing.\n\n“‘Theodore, do you know anything about this harmony of colors? Excuse\nme, madam,—and I crave your pardon, Mr. Ochiltree, for using your given\nname,—but really this harmony of colors is all French to me.’\n\n“‘Well, if the young lady is in town, why can’t you have her drop in\nand make her own selection?’ suggested the blond milliner. He studied a\nmoment, and then awoke as if from a trance. ‘Just as easy as not; this\nvery evening or in the morning. Strange we didn’t think of that sooner.\nYes; the landlady of the hotel can join us, and we can count on your\nassistance in selecting the hat.’ With a number of comments on her\nattractive place, inquiries regarding trade, and a flattering\ncompliment on having made such a charming acquaintance, we edged\ntowards the door. ‘This evening then, or in the morning at the\nfarthest, you may expect another call, when my friend must pay the\npenalty of his folly by settling the bill. Put it on heavy.’ And he\ngave her a parting wink.\n\n“Together we bowed ourselves out, and once safe in the street he said:\n‘Didn’t she help us out of that easy? If she wasn’t a blonde, I’d go\nback and buy her two hats for suggesting it as she did.’\n\n“‘Rather good looking too,’ I remarked.\n\n“‘Oh, well, that’s a matter of taste. I like people with red blood in\nthem. Now if you was to saw her arm off, it wouldn’t bleed; just a\nlittle white water might ooze out, possibly. The best-looking girl I\never saw was down in the lower Rio Grande country, and she was milking\na goat. Theodore, my dear fellow, when I’m led blushingly to the altar,\nyou’ll be proud of my choice. I’m a judge of beauty.’”\n\nIt was after midnight when we disposed of the first oven of pigeon\npot-pie, and, wrapping ourselves in blankets, lay down around the fire.\nWith the first sign of dawn, we were aroused by Mr. Nathan and Uncle\nLance to witness the return flight of the birds to their feeding\ngrounds. Hurrying to the nearest opening, we saw the immense flight of\npigeons blackening the sky overhead. Stiffened by their night’s rest,\nthey flew low; but the beauty and immensity of the flight overawed us,\nand we stood in mute admiration, no one firing a shot. For fully a\nhalf-hour the flight continued, ending in a few scattering birds.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\nSPRING OF ’76\n\n\nThe spring of ’76 was eventful at Las Palomas. After the pigeon hunt,\nUncle Lance went to San Antonio to sell cattle for spring delivery.\nMeanwhile, Father Norquin visited the ranch and spent a few days among\nhis parishioners, Miss Jean acting the hostess in behalf of Las\nPalomas. The priest proved a congenial fellow of the cloth, and among\nus, with Miss Jean’s countenance, it was decided not to delay Enrique’s\nmarriage; for there was no telling when Uncle Lance would return. All\nthe arrangements were made by the padre and Miss Jean, the groom-to-be\napparently playing a minor part in the preliminaries. Though none of\nthe white element of the ranch were communicants of his church, the\npriest apparently enjoyed the visit. At parting, the mistress pressed a\ngold piece into his chubby palm as the marriage fee for Enrique; and,\nafter naming a day for the ceremony, the padre mounted his horse and\nleft us for the Tarancalous, showering his blessings on Las Palomas and\nits people.\n\nDuring the intervening days before the wedding, we overhauled an unused\n_jacal_ and made it habitable for the bride and groom. The _jacal_ is a\ncrude structure of this semi-tropical country, containing but a single\nroom with a shady, protecting stoop. It is constructed by standing\npalisades on end in a trench. These constitute the walls. The floor is\nearthen, while the roof is thatched with the wild grass which grows\nrank in the overflow portions of the river valley. It forms a\nserviceable shelter for a warm country, the peculiar roofing equally\ndefying rain and the sun’s heat. Under the leadership of the mistress\nof the ranch, assisted by the Mexican women, the _jacal_ was\ntransformed into a rustic bower; for Enrique was not only a favorite\namong the whites, but also among his own people. A few gaudy pictures\nof Saints and the Madonna ornamented the side walls, while in the rear\nhung the necessary crucifix. At the time of its building the _jacal_\nhad been blessed, as was customary before occupancy, and to Enrique’s\nreasoning the potency of the former sprinkling still held good.\n\nWeddings were momentous occasions among the Mexican population at Las\nPalomas. In outfitting the party to attend Enrique’s wedding at Santa\nMaria, the ranch came to a standstill. Not only the regular ambulance\nbut a second conveyance was required to transport the numerous female\nrelatives of the groom, while the men, all in gala attire, were mounted\non the best horses on the ranch. As none of the whites attended,\nDeweese charged Tiburcio with humanity to the stock, while the mistress\nadmonished every one to be on his good behavior. With greetings to\nSanta Maria, the wedding party set out. They were expected to return\nthe following evening, and the ranch was set in order to give the bride\na rousing reception on her arrival at Las Palomas. The largest place on\nthe ranch was a warehouse, and we shifted its contents in such a manner\nas to have quite a commodious ball-room. The most notable decoration of\nthe room was an immense heart-shaped figure, in which was worked in\nlive-oak leaves the names of the two ranches, flanked on either side\nwith the American and Mexican flags. Numerous other decorations,\nexpressing welcome to the bride, were in evidence on every hand. Tallow\nwas plentiful at Las Palomas, and candles were fastened at every\npossible projection.\n\nThe mounted members of the wedding party returned near the middle of\nthe afternoon. According to reports, Santa Maria had treated them most\nhospitably. The marriage was simple, but the festivities following had\nlasted until dawn. The returning guests sought their _jacals_ to snatch\na few hours’ sleep before the revelry would be resumed at Las Palomas.\nAn hour before sunset the four-mule ambulance bearing the bride and\ngroom drove into Las Palomas with a flourish. Before leaving the bridal\ncouple at their own _jacal_, Tiburcio halted the ambulance in front of\nthe ranch-house for the formal welcome. In the absence of her brother,\nMiss Jean officiated in behalf of Las Palomas, tenderly caressing the\nbride. The boys monopolized her with their congratulations and welcome,\nwhich delighted Enrique. As for the bride, she seemed at home from the\nfirst, soon recognizing me as the _padrino segundo_ at the time of her\nbetrothal.\n\nQuite a delegation of the bride’s friends from Santa Maria accompanied\nthe party on their return, from whom were chosen part of the musicians\nfor the evening—violins and guitars in the hands of the native element\nof the two ranches making up a pastoral orchestra. I volunteered my\nservices; but so much of the music was new to me that I frequently\nexcused myself for a dance with the senoritas. In the absence of Uncle\nLance, our _segundo_, June Deweese, claimed the first dance of the\nevening with the bride. Miss Jean lent only the approval of her\npresence, not participating, and withdrawing at an early hour. As all\nthe American element present spoke Spanish slightly, that became the\nlanguage of the evening. But, further than to countenance with our\npresence the festivities, we were out of place, and, ere midnight, all\nhad excused themselves with the exception of Aaron Scales and myself.\nOn the pleadings of Enrique, I remained an hour or two longer, dancing\nwith his bride, or playing some favorite selection for the delighted\ngroom.\n\nSeveral days after the wedding Uncle Lance returned. He had been\nsuccessful in contracting a trail herd of thirty-five hundred cattle,\nand a _remuda_ of one hundred and twenty-five saddle horses with which\nto handle them. The contract called for two thousand two-year-old\nsteers and fifteen hundred threes. There was a difference of four\ndollars a head in favor of the older cattle, and it was the ranchero’s\nintention to fill the latter class entirely from the Las Palomas brand.\nAs to the younger cattle, neighboring ranches would be invited to\ndeliver twos in filling the contract, and if any were lacking, the home\nranch would supply the deficiency. Having ample range, the difference\nin price was an inducement to hold the younger cattle. To keep a steer\nanother year cost nothing, while the ranchero returned convinced that\nthe trail might soon furnish an outlet for all surplus cattle. In the\nmatter of the horses, too, rather than reduce our supply of saddle\nstock below the actual needs of the ranch, Uncle Lance concluded to buy\nfifty head in making up the _remuda_. There were several hundred\ngeldings on the ranch old enough for saddle purposes, but they would be\nas good as useless in handling cattle the first year after breaking.\n\nAs this would be the first trail herd from Las Palomas, we naturally\nfelt no small pride in the transaction. According to contract,\neverything was to be ready for final delivery on the twenty-fifth of\nMarch. The contractors, Camp & Dupree, of Fort Worth, Texas, were to\nsend their foreman two weeks in advance to receive, classify, and pass\nupon the cattle and saddle stock. They were exacting in their demands,\nyet humane and reasonable. In making up the herd no cattle were to be\ncorralled at night, and no animal would be received which had been\nroped. The saddle horses were to be treated likewise. These conditions\nwould put into the saddle every available man on the ranch as well as\non the ranchitas. But we looked eagerly forward to the putting up of\nthe herd. Letters were written and dispatched to a dozen ranches within\nstriking distance, inviting them to turn in two-year-old steers at the\nfull contract price. June Deweese was sent out to buy fifty saddle\nhorses, which would fill the required standard, “fourteen hands or\nbetter, serviceable and gentle broken.” I was dispatched to Santa\nMaria, to invite Don Mateo Gonzales to participate in the contract. The\nrange of every saddle horse on the ranch was located, so that we could\ngather them, when wanted, in a day. Less than a month’s time now\nremained before the delivery day, though we did not expect to go into\ncamp for actual gathering until the arrival of the trail foreman.\n\nIn going and returning from San Antonio my employer had traveled by\nstage. As it happened, the driver of the up-stage out of Oakville was\nJack Martin, the son-in-law of Mrs. McLeod. He and Uncle Lance being\nacquainted, the old ranchero’s matchmaking instincts had, during the\nday’s travel, again forged to the front. By roundabout inquiries he had\nelicited the information that Mrs. McLeod had, immediately after the\nholidays, taken Esther to San Antonio and placed her in school. By\ninnocent artful suggestions of his interest in the welfare of the\nfamily, he learned the name of the private school of which Esther was a\npupil. Furthermore, he cultivated the good will of the driver in\nvarious ways over good cigars, and at parting assured him on returning\nhe would take the stage so as to have the pleasure of his company on\nthe return trip—the highest compliment that could be paid a\nstage-driver.\n\nFrom several sources I had learned that Esther had left the ranch for\nthe city, but on Uncle Lance’s return I got the full particulars. As a\nneighboring ranchman, and bearing self-invented messages from the\nfamily, he had the assurance to call at the school. His honest\ncountenance was a passport anywhere, and he not only saw Esther but\nprevailed on her teachers to give the girl, some time during his visit\nin the city, a half holiday. The interest he manifested in the girl won\nhis request, and the two had spent an afternoon visiting the parks and\nother points of interest. It is needless to add that he made hay in my\nbehalf during this half holiday. But the most encouraging fact that he\nunearthed was that Esther was disgusted with her school life and was\nhomesick. She had declared that if she ever got away from school, no\npower on earth could force her back again.\n\n“Shucks, Tom,” said he, the next morning after his return, as we were\nsitting in the shade of the corrals waiting for the _remuda_ to come\nin, “that poor little country girl might as well be in a penitentiary\nas in that school. She belongs on these prairies, and you can’t make\nanything else out of her. I can read between the lines, and any one can\nsee that her education is finished. When she told me how rudely her\nmother had treated you, her heart was an open book and easily read.\nDon’t you lose any sleep on how you stand in her affections—that’s all\nserene. She’ll he home on a spring vacation, and that’ll be your\nchance. If I was your age, I’d make it a point to see that she didn’t\ngo back to school. She’ll run off with you rather than that. In the\ngame of matrimony, son, you want to play your cards boldly and never\nhesitate to lead trumps.”\n\nTo further matters, when returning by stage my employer had ingratiated\nhimself into the favor of the driver in many ways, and urged him to\nsend word to Mrs. McLeod to turn in her two-year-olds on his contract.\nA few days later her foreman and son-in-law, Tony Hunter, rode down to\nLas Palomas, anxious for the chance to turn in cattle. There had been\nlittle opportunity for several years to sell steers, and when a chance\nlike this came, there would have been no trouble to fill half a dozen\ncontracts, as supply far exceeded demand.\n\nUncle Lance let Mrs. McLeod’s foreman feel that in allotting her five\nhundred of the younger cattle, he was actuated by old-time friendship\nfor the family. As a mark of special consideration he promised to send\nthe trail foreman to the San Miguel to pass on the cattle on their home\nrange, but advised the foreman to gather at least seven hundred steers,\nallowing for two hundred to be culled or cut back. Hunter remained over\nnight, departing the next morning, delighted over his allowance of\ncattle and the liberal terms of the contract.\n\nIt was understood that, in advance of his outfit, the trail foreman\nwould come down by stage, and I was sent into Oakville with an extra\nsaddle horse to meet him. He had arrived the day previous, and we lost\nno time in starting for Las Palomas. This trail foreman was about\nthirty years of age, a quiet red-headed fellow, giving the name of\nFrank Nancrede, and before we had covered half the distance to the\nranch I was satisfied that he was a cowman. I always prided myself on\npossessing a good eye for brands, but he outclassed me, reading strange\nbrands at over a hundred yards, and distinguishing cattle from horse\nstock at a distance of three miles.’\n\nWe got fairly well acquainted before reaching the ranch, but it was\nimpossible to start him on any subject save cattle. I was able to give\nhim a very good idea of the _remuda_, which was then under herd and\nwaiting his approval, and I saw the man brighten into a smile for the\nfirst time on my offering to help him pick out a good mount for his own\nsaddle. I had a vague idea of what the trail was like, and felt the\nusual boyish attraction for it; but when I tried to draw him out in\nregard to it, he advised me, if I had a regular job on a ranch, to let\ntrail work alone.\n\nWe reached the ranch late in the evening and I introduced Nancrede to\nUncle Lance, who took charge of him. We had established a horse camp\nfor the trail _remuda_, north of the river, and the next morning the\ntrail foreman, my employer, and June Deweese, rode over to pass on the\nsaddle stock. The _remuda_ pleased him, being fully up to the contract\nstandard, and he accepted it with but a single exception. This\nexception tickled Uncle Lance, as it gave him an opportunity to annoy\nhis sister about Nancrede, as he did about every other cowman or drover\nwho visited the ranch. That evening, as I was chatting with Miss Jean,\nwho was superintending the Mexican help milking at the cow pen, Uncle\nLance joined us.\n\n“Say, Sis,” said he, “our man Nancrede is a cowman all right. I tried\nto ring in a ‘hipped’ horse on him this morning,—one hip knocked down\njust the least little bit,—but he noticed it and refused to accept him.\nOh, he’s got an eye in his head all right. So if you say so, I’ll give\nhim the best horse on the ranch in old Hippy’s place. You’re always\nmaking fun of slab-sided cowmen; he’s pony-built enough to suit you,\nand I kind o’ like the color of his hair myself. Did you notice his\nneck?—he’ll never tie it if it gets broken. I like a short man; if he\nstubs his toe and falls down he doesn’t reach halfway home. Now, if he\nhas as good cow sense in receiving the herd as he had on the _remuda_,\nI’d kind o’ like to have him for a brother-in-law. I’m getting a little\ntoo old for active work and would like to retire, but June, the durn\nfool, won’t get married, and about the only show I’ve got is to get a\nhusband for you. I’d as lief live in Hades as on a ranch without a\nwoman on it. What do you think of him?”\n\n“Why, I think he’s an awful nice fellow, but he won’t talk. And\nbesides, I’m not baiting my hook for small fish like trail foremen; I\nwas aiming to keep my smiles for the contractors. Aren’t they coming\ndown?”\n\n“Well, they might come to look the herd over before it starts out. Now,\nDupree is a good cowman, but he’s got a wife already. And Camp, the\nfinancial man of the firm, made his money peddling Yankee clocks. Now,\nyou don’t suppose for a moment I’d let you marry him and carry you away\nfrom Las Palomas. Marry an old clock peddler?—not if he had a million!\nThe idea! If they come down here and I catch you smiling on old Camp,\nI’ll set the hounds on you. What you want to do is to set your cap for\nNancrede. Of course, you’re ten years the elder, but that needn’t cut\nany figure. So just burn a few smiles on the red-headed trail foreman!\nYou know you can count on your loving brother to help all he can.”\n\nThe conversation was interrupted by our _segundo_ and the trail foreman\nriding up to the cow pen. The two had been up the river during the\nafternoon, looking over the cattle on the range, for as yet we had not\ncommenced gathering. Nancrede was very reticent, discovering a\nconspicuous lack of words to express his opinion of what cattle Deweese\nhad shown him.\n\nThe second day after the arrival of the trail foreman, we divided our\nforces into two squads and started out to gather our three-year-olds.\nBy the ranch records, there were over two thousand steers of that age\nin the Las Palomas brand. Deweese took ten men and half of the ranch\nsaddle horses and went up above the mouth of the Ganso to begin\ngathering. Uncle Lance took the remainder of the men and horses and\nwent down the river nearly to Shepherd’s, leaving Dan Happersett and\nthree Mexicans to hold and night-herd the trail _remuda._ Nancrede\ndeclined to stay at the ranch and so joined our outfit on the\ndown-river trip. We had postponed the gathering until the last hour,\nfor every day improved the growing grass on which our mounts must\ndepend for subsistence, and once we started, there would be little rest\nfor men or horses.\n\nThe younger cattle for the herd were made up within a week after the\ninvitations were sent to the neighboring ranches. Naturally they would\nbe the last cattle to be received and would come in for delivery\nbetween the twentieth and the last of the month. With the plans thus\noutlined, we started our gathering. Counting Nancrede, we had twelve\nmen in the saddle in our down-river outfit. Taking nothing but\nthree-year-olds, we did not accumulate cattle fast; but it was\ncontinuous work, every man, with the exception of Uncle Lance, standing\na guard on night-herd. The first two days we only gathered about five\nhundred steers. This number was increased by about three hundred on the\nthird day, and that evening Dan Happersett with a vaquero rode into\ncamp and reported that Nancrede’s outfit had arrived from San Antonio.\nHe had turned the _remuda_ over to them on their arrival, sending the\nother two Mexicans to join Deweese above on the river.\n\nThe fourth day finished the gathering. Nancrede remained with us to the\nlast, making a hand which left no doubt in any one’s mind that he was a\ncowman from the ground up. The last round-up on the afternoon of the\nfourth day, our outriders sighted the vaqueros from Deweese’s outfit,\ncircling and drifting in the cattle on their half of the circle. The\nnext morning the two camps were thrown together on the river opposite\nthe ranch. Deweese had fully as many cattle as we had, and when the two\ncuts had been united and counted, we lacked but five head of nineteen\nhundred. Several of Nancrede’s men joined us that morning, and within\nan hour, under the trail foreman’s directions, we cut back the\noverplus, and the cattle were accepted.\n\nUnder the contract we were to road-brand them, though Nancrede ordered\nhis men to assist us in the work. Under ordinary circumstances we\nshould also have vented the ranch brand, but owing to the fact that\nthis herd was to be trailed to Abilene, Kansas, and possibly sold\nbeyond that point, it was unnecessary and therefore omitted. We had a\nbranding chute on the ranch for grown cattle, and the following morning\nthe herd was corralled and the road-branding commenced. The cattle were\nuniform in size, and the stamping of the figure ‘4’ over the holding\n“Lazy L” of Las Palomas, moved like clockwork. With a daybreak start\nand an abundance of help the last animal was ironed up before sundown.\nAs a favor to Nancrede’s outfit, their camp being nearly five miles\ndistant, we held them the first night after branding.\n\nNo sooner had the trail foreman accepted our three-year-olds than he\nand Glen Gallup set out for the McLeod ranch on the San Miguel. The day\nour branding was finished, the two returned near midnight, reported the\nSan Miguel cattle accepted and due the next evening at Las Palomas. By\ndawn Nancrede and myself started for Santa Maria, the former being\ndeficient in Spanish, the only weak point, if it was one, in his\nmake-up as a cowman. We were slightly disappointed in not finding the\ncattle ready to pass upon at Santa Maria. That ranch was to deliver\nseven hundred, and on our arrival they had not even that number under\nherd. Don Mateo, an easy-going ranchero, could not understand the\nnecessity of such haste. What did it matter if the cattle were\ndelivered on the twenty-fifth or twenty-seventh? But I explained as\ndelicately as I could that this was a trail man, whose vocabulary did\nnot contain _mañana_. In interpreting for Nancrede, I learned something\nof the trail myself: that a herd should start with the grass and move\nwith it, keeping the freshness of spring, day after day and week after\nweek, as they trailed northward. The trail foreman assured Don Mateo\nthat had his employers known that this was to be such an early spring,\nthe herd would have started a week sooner.\n\nBy impressing on the ranchero the importance of not delaying this trail\nman, we got him to inject a little action into his corporal. We asked\nDon Mateo for horses and, joining his outfit, made three rodeos that\nafternoon, turning into the cattle under herd nearly two hundred and\nfifty head by dark that evening. Nancrede spent a restless night, and\nat dawn, as the cattle were leaving the bed ground, he and I got an\neasy count on them and culled them down to the required number before\nbreakfasting. We had some little trouble explaining to Don Mateo the\nnecessity of giving the bill of sale to my employer, who, in turn,\nwould reconvey the stock to the contractors. Once the matter was made\nclear, the accepted cattle were started for Las Palomas. When we\novertook them an hour afterward, I instructed the corporal, at the\ninstance of the red-headed foreman, to take a day and a half in\nreaching the ranch; that tardiness in gathering must not be made up by\na hasty drive to the point of delivery; that the animals must be\ntreated humanely.\n\nOn reaching the ranch we found that Mr. Booth and some of his neighbors\nhad arrived from the Frio with their contingent. They had been allotted\nsix hundred head, and had brought down about two hundred extra cattle\nin order to allow some choice in accepting. These were the only mixed\nbrands that came in on the delivery, and after they had been culled\ndown and accepted, my employer appointed Aaron Scales as clerk. There\nwere some five or six owners, and Scales must catch the brands as they\nwere freed from the branding chute. Several of the owners kept a\nprivate tally, but not once did they have occasion to check up the\nMarylander’s decisions. Before the branding of this hunch was finished,\nWilson, from Ramirena, rode into the ranch and announced his cattle\nwithin five miles of Las Palomas. As these were the last two hundred to\nbe passed upon, Nancrede asked to have them in sight of the ranch by\nsun-up in the morning.\n\nOn the arrival of the trail outfit from San Antonio, they brought a\nletter from the contractors, asking that a conveyance meet them at\nOakville, as they wished to see the herd before it started. Tiburcio\nwent in with the ambulance to meet them, and they reached the ranch\nlate at night. On their arrival twenty-six hundred of the cattle had\nalready been passed upon, branded, and were then being held by\nNancrede’s outfit across the river at their camp. Dupree, being a\npractical cowman, understood the situation; but Camp was restless and\nuneasy as if he expected to find the cattle in the corrals at the\nranch. Camp was years the older of the two, a pudgy man with a florid\ncomplexion and nasal twang, and kept the junior member busy answering\nhis questions. Uncle Lance enjoyed the situation, jollying his sister\nabout the elder contractor and quietly inquiring of the red-haired\nforeman how and where Dupree had picked him up.\n\nThe contractors had brought no saddles with them, so the ambulance was\nthe only mode of travel. As we rode out to receive the Wilson cattle\nthe next morning, Uncle Lance took advantage of the occasion to jolly\nNancrede further about the senior member of the firm, the foreman\nsmiling appreciatingly. “The way your old man talked last night,” said\nhe, “you’d think he expected to find the herd in the front yard. Too\nbad to disappoint him; for then he could have looked them over with a\nlantern from the gallery of the house. Now, if they had been Yankee\nclocks instead of cattle, why, he’d been right at home, and could have\ntaken them in the house and handled them easily. It certainly beats the\ndickens why some men want to break into the cattle business. It won’t\nsurprise me if he asks you to trail the herd past the ranch so he can\nsee them. Well, you and Dupree will have to make him some _dinero_ this\nsummer or you will lose him for a partner. I can see that sticking\nout.”\n\nWe received and branded the two hundred Wilson cattle that forenoon,\nsending them to the main herd across the river. Mr. Wilson and Uncle\nLance were great cronies, and as the latter was feeling in fine fettle\nover the successful fulfillment of his contract, he was tempted also to\njolly his neighbor ranchero over his cattle, which, by the way, were\nfine. “Nate,” said he to Mr. Wilson, “it looks like you’d quit breeding\ngoats and rear cattle instead. Honest, if I didn’t know your brand, I’d\nswear some Mexican raised this bunch. These Fort Worth cowmen are an\neasy lot, or yours would never have passed under the classification.”\n\nAn hour before noon, Tomas Martines, the corporal of Santa Maria, rode\nup to inquire what time we wished his cattle at the corrals. They were\nback several miles, and he could deliver them on an hour’s notice. One\no’clock was agreed upon, and, never dismounting, the corporal galloped\naway to his herd. “Quirk,” said Nancrede to me, noticing the Mexican’s\nunaccustomed air of enterprise, “if we had that fellow under us awhile\nwe’d make a cow-hand out of him. See the wiggle he gets on himself now,\nwill you?” Promptly at the hour, the herd were counted and corralled,\nDon Mateo Gonzales not troubling to appear, which was mystifying to the\nNorth Texas men, but Uncle Lance explained that a mere incident like\nselling seven hundred cattle was not sufficient occasion to arouse the\nranchero of Santa Maria when his corporal could attend to the business.\n\nThat evening saw the last of the cattle branded. The herd was completed\nand ready to start the following morning. The two contractors were\ndriven across the river during the afternoon to look over the herd and\n_remuda_. At the instance of my employer, I wrote a letter of\ncongratulation to Don Mateo, handing it to his corporal, informing him\nthat in the course of ten days a check would he sent him in payment.\nUncle Lance had fully investigated the financial standing of the\ncontractors, but it was necessary for him to return with them to San\nAntonio for a final settlement.\n\nThe ambulance made an early start for Oakville on the morning of the\ntwenty-sixth, carrying the contractors and my employer, and the rest of\nus rode away to witness the start of the herd. Nancrede’s outfit\nnumbered fifteen,—a cook, a horse wrangler, himself, and twelve\noutriders. They comprised an odd mixture of men, several barely my age,\nwhile others were gray-haired and looked like veteran cow-hands. On\nleaving the Nueces valley, the herd was strung out a mile in length,\nand after riding with them until they reached the first hills, we bade\nthem good-by. As we started to return Frank Nancrede made a remark to\nJune Deweese which I have often recalled: “You fellows may think this\nis a snap; but if I had a job on as good a ranch as Las Palomas, you’d\nnever catch me on a cattle trail.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\nSAN JACINTO DAY\n\n\nA few days later, when Uncle Lance returned from San Antonio, we had a\nconfidential talk, and he decided not to send me with the McLeod check\nto the San Miguel. He had reasons of his own, and I was dispatched to\nthe Frio instead, while to Enrique fell the pleasant task of a similar\nerrand to Santa Maria. In order to grind an axe, Glenn Gallup was sent\ndown to Wilson’s with the settlement for the Ramirena cattle, which\nUncle Lance made the occasion of a jovial expression of his theory of\nlove-making. “Don’t waste any words with old man Nate,” said he, as he\nhanded Glenn the check; “but build right up to Miss Jule. Holy snakes,\nboy, if I was your age I would make her dizzy with a big talk. Tell her\nyou’re thinking of quitting Las Palomas and driving a trail herd\nyourself next year. Tell it big and scary. Make her eyes fairly bulge\nout, and when you can’t think of anything else, tell her she’s pretty.”\n\nI spent a day or two at the Booth ranch, and on my return found the Las\nPalomas outfit in the saddle working our horse stock. Yearly we made up\nnew _manadas_ from the two-year-old fillies. There were enough young\nmares to form twelve bands of about twenty-five head each. In selecting\nthese we were governed by standard colors, bays, browns, grays, blacks,\nand sorrels forming separate _manadas,_ while all mongrel colors went\ninto two bands by themselves. In the latter class there was a tendency\nfor the colors of the old Spanish stock,—coyotes, and other hybrid\nmixtures,—after being dormant for generations, to crop out again. In\nbreaking these fillies into new bands, we added a stallion a year or\ntwo older and of acceptable color, and they were placed in charge of a\ntrusty vaquero, whose duty was to herd them for the first month after\nbeing formed. The Mexican in charge usually took the band round the\ncircuit of the various ranchitas, corralling his charge at night,\ndrifting at will, so that by the end of the month old associations\nwould be severed, and from that time the stallion could be depended on\nas herdsman.\n\nIn gathering the fillies, we also cut out all the geldings three years\nold and upward to break for saddle purposes. There were fully two\nhundred of these, and the month of April was spent in saddle-breaking\nthis number. They were a fine lot of young horses, and under the master\neye of two perfect horsemen, our _segundo_ and employer, every horse\nwas broken with intelligence and humanity. Since the day of their\nbranding as colts these geldings had never felt the touch of a human\nhand; and it required more than ordinary patience to overcome their\nfear, bring them to a condition of submission, and make serviceable\nranch horses out of them. The most difficult matter was in overcoming\ntheir fear. It was also necessary to show the mastery of man over the\nanimal, though this process was tempered with humanity. We had several\ncircular, sandy corrals into which the horse to be broken was admitted\nfor the first saddling. As he ran round, a lasso skillfully thrown\nencircled his front feet and he came down on his side. One fore foot\nwas strapped up, a hackamore or bitless bridle was adjusted in place,\nand he was allowed to arise. After this, all depended on the patience\nand firmness of the handler. Some horses yielded to kind advances and\naccepted the saddle within half an hour, not even offering to pitch,\nwhile others repelled every kindness and fought for hours. But in\nhandling the gelding of spirit, we could always count on the help of an\nextra saddler.\n\nWhile this work was being done, the herd of geldings was held close at\nhand. After the first riding, four horses were the daily allowance of\neach rider. With the amount of help available, this allowed twelve to\nfifteen horses to the man, so that every animal was ridden once in\nthree or four days. Rather than corral, we night-herded, penning them\nby dawn and riding our first horse before sun-up. As they gradually\nyielded, we increased our number to six a day and finally before the\nbreaking was over to eight. When the work was finally over they were\ncut into _remudas_ of fifty horses each, furnished a gentle bell mare,\nwhen possible with a young colt by her side, and were turned over to a\nsimilar treatment as was given the fillies in forming _manadas._ Thus\nthe different _remudas_ at Las Palomas always took the name of the bell\nmare, and when we were at work, it was only necessary for us to hobble\nthe princess at night to insure the presence of her band in the\nmorning.\n\nWhen this month’s work was two thirds over, we enjoyed a holiday. All\ngood Texans, whether by birth or adoption, celebrate the twenty-first\nof April,—San Jacinto Day. National holidays may not always be observed\nin sparsely settled communities, but this event will remain a great\nanniversary until the sons and daughters of the Lone Star State lose\ntheir patriotism or forget the blessings of liberty. As Shepherd’s\nFerry was centrally located, it became by common consent the\nmeeting-point for our local celebration. Residents from the Frio and\nSan Miguel and as far south on the home river as Lagarto, including the\nvillagers of Oakville, usually lent their presence on this occasion.\nThe white element of Las Palomas was present without an exception. As\nusual, Miss Jean went by ambulance, starting the afternoon before and\nspending the night at a ranch above the ferry. Those remaining made a\ndaybreak start, reaching Shepherd’s by ten in the morning.\n\nWhile on the way from the ranch to the ferry, I was visited with some\nmisgivings as to whether Esther McLeod had yet returned from San\nAntonio. At the delivery of San Miguel’s cattle at Las Palomas, Miss\nJean had been very attentive to Tony Hunter, Esther’s brother-in-law,\nand through him she learned that Esther’s school closed for the summer\nvacation on the fifteenth of April, and that within a week afterward\nshe was expected at home. Shortly after our reaching the ferry, a\nnumber of vehicles drove in from Oakville. One of these conveyances was\nan elaborate six-horse stage, owned by Bethel & Oxenford, star route\nmail contractors between San Antonio and Brownsville, Texas. Seated by\nyoung Oxenford’s side in the driver’s box sat Esther McLeod, while\ninside the coach was her sister, Mrs. Martin, with the senior member of\nthe firm, his wife, and several other invited guests. I had heard\nsomething of the gallantry of young Jack Oxenford, who was the nephew\nof a carpet-bag member of Congress, and prided himself on being the\nbest whip in the country. In the latter field I would gladly have\nyielded him all honors, but his attentions to Esther were altogether\ntoo marked to please either me or my employer. I am free to admit that\nI was troubled by this turn of affairs. The junior mail contractor made\nup in egotism what he lacked in appearance, and no doubt had money to\nburn, as star route mail contracting was profitable those days, while I\nhad nothing but my monthly wages. To make matters more embarrassing, a\nblind man could have read Mrs. Martin’s approval of young Oxenford.\n\nThe programme for the forenoon was brief—a few patriotic songs and an\noration by a young lawyer who had come up from Corpus Christi for the\noccasion. After listening to the opening song, my employer and I took a\nstroll down by the river, as we were too absorbed in the new\ncomplications to pay proper attention to the young orator.\n\n“Tom,” said Uncle Lance, as we strolled away from the grove, “we are up\nagainst the real thing now. I know young Oxenford, and he’s a dangerous\nfellow to have for a rival, if he really is one. You can’t tell much\nabout a Yankee, though, for he’s usually egotistical enough to think\nthat every girl in the country is breaking her neck to win him. The\nworst of it is, this young fellow is rich—he’s got dead oodles of money\nand he’s making more every hour out of his mail contracts. One good\nthing is, we understand the situation, and all’s fair in love and war.\nYou can see, though, that Mrs. Martin has dealt herself a hand in the\ngame. By the dough on her fingers she proposes to have a fist in the\npie. Well, now, son, we’ll give them a run for their money or break a\ntug in the effort. Tom, just you play to my lead to-day and we’ll see\nwho holds the high cards or knows best how to play them. If I can cut\nhim off, that’ll be your chance to sail in and do a little\nclose-herding yourself.”\n\nWe loitered along the river bank until the oration was concluded, my\nemployer giving me quite an interesting account of my rival. It seems\nthat young Oxenford belonged to a family then notoriously prominent in\npolitics. He had inherited quite a sum of money, and, through the\ninfluence of his congressional uncle, had been fortunate enough to form\na partnership with Bethel, a man who knew all the ropes in mail\ncontracting. The senior member of the firm knew how to shake the tree,\nwhile the financial resources of the junior member and the political\ninfluence of his uncle made him a valuable man in gathering the plums\non their large field of star route contracts. Had not exposure\ninterrupted, they were due to have made a large fortune out of the\ngovernment.\n\nOn our return to the picnic grounds, the assembly was dispersing for\nluncheon. Miss Jean had ably provided for the occasion, and on reaching\nour ambulance on the outer edge of the grove, Tiburcio had coffee all\nready and the boys from the home ranch began to straggle in for dinner.\nMiss Jean had prevailed on Tony Hunter and his wife, who had come down\non horseback from the San Miguel, to take luncheon with us, and from\nthe hearty greetings which Uncle Lance extended to the guests of his\nsister, I could see that the owner and mistress of Las Palomas were\ndiplomatically dividing the house of McLeod. I followed suit, making\nmyself agreeable to Mrs. Hunter, who was but very few years the elder\nof Esther. Having spent a couple of nights at their ranch, and feeling\na certain comradeship with her husband, I decided before dinner was\nover that I had a friend and ally in Tony’s wife. There was something\nromantic about the young matron, as any one could see, and since the\nsisters favored each other in many ways, I had hopes that Esther might\nnot overvalue Jack Oxenford’s money.\n\nAfter luncheon, as we were on our way to the dancing arbor, we met the\nOakville party with Esther in tow. I was introduced to Mrs. Martin,\nwho, in turn, made me acquainted with her friends, including her\nsister, perfectly unconscious that we were already more than mere\nacquaintances. From the demure manner of Esther, who accepted the\nintroduction as a matter of course, I surmised she was concealing our\nacquaintance from her sister and my rival. We had hardly reached the\narbor before Uncle Lance created a diversion and interested the mail\ncontractors with a glowing yarn about a fine lot of young mules he had\nat the ranch, large enough for stage purposes. There was some doubt\nexpressed by the stage men as to their size and weight, when my\nemployer invited them to the outskirts of the grove, where he would\nshow them a sample in our ambulance team. So he led them away, and I\nsaw that the time had come to play to my employer’s lead. The music\nstriking up, I claimed Esther for the first dance, leaving Mrs. Martin,\nfor the time being, in charge of her sister and Miss Jean. Before the\nfirst waltz ended I caught sight of all three of the ladies mingling in\nthe dance. It was a source of no small satisfaction to me to see my two\nbest friends, Deweese and Gallup, dancing with the married sisters,\nwhile Miss Jean was giving her whole attention to her partner, Tony\nHunter. With the entire Las Palomas crowd pulling strings in my\ninterest, and Father, in the absence of Oxenford, becoming extremely\ngracious, I grew bold and threw out my chest like the brisket on a beef\nsteer.\n\nI permitted no one to separate me from Esther. We started the second\ndance together, but no sooner did I see her sister, Mrs. Martin, whirl\nby us in the polka with Dan Happersett, than I suggested that we drop\nout and take a stroll. She consented, and we were soon out of sight,\nwandering in a labyrinth of lover’s lanes which abounded throughout\nthis live-oak grove. On reaching the outskirts of the picnic grounds,\nwe came to an extensive opening in which our saddle horses were\npicketed. At a glance Esther recognized Wolf, the horse I had ridden\nthe Christmas before when passing their ranch. Being a favorite saddle\nhorse of the old ranchero, he was reserved for special occasions, and\nUncle Lance had ridden him down to Shepherd’s on this holiday. Like a\nbird freed from a cage, the ranch girl took to the horses and insisted\non a little ride. Since her proposal alone prevented my making a\nsimilar suggestion, I allowed myself to be won over, but came near\ngetting caught in protesting. “But you told me at the ranch that Wolf\nwas one of ten in your Las Palomas mount,” she poutingly protested.\n\n“He is,” I insisted, “but I have loaned him to Uncle Lance for the\nday.”\n\n“Throw the saddle on him then—I’ll tell Mr. Lovelace when we return\nthat I borrowed his horse when he wasn’t looking.”\n\nHad she killed the horse, I felt sure that the apology would have been\naccepted; so, throwing saddles on the black and my own mount, we were\nsoon scampering down the river. The inconvenience of a man’s saddle, or\nthe total absence of any, was a negligible incident to this daughter of\nthe plains. A mile down the river, we halted and watered the horses.\nThen, crossing the stream, we spent about an hour circling slowly about\non the surrounding uplands, never being over a mile from the picnic\ngrounds. It was late for the first flora of the season, but there was\nstill an abundance of blue bonnets. Dismounting, we gathered and wove\nwreaths for our horses’ necks, and wandered picking the Mexican\nstrawberries which grew plentifully on every hand.\n\nBut this was all preliminary to the main question. When it came up for\ndiscussion, this one of Quirk’s boys made the talk of his life in\nbehalf of Thomas Moore. Nor was it in vain. When Esther apologized for\nthe rudeness her mother had shown me at her home, that afforded me the\nopening for which I was longing. We were sitting on a grassy hummock,\nweaving garlands, when I replied to the apology by declaring my\nintention of marrying her, with or without her mother’s consent.\nUnconventional as the declaration was, to my surprise she showed\nneither offense nor wonderment. Dropping the flowers with which we were\nworking, she avoided my gaze, and, turning slightly from me, began\nwatching our horses, which had strayed away some distance. But I gave\nher little time for meditation, and when I aroused her from her\nreverie, she rose, saying, “We’d better go back—they’ll miss us if we\nstay too long.”\n\nBefore complying with her wish, I urged an answer; but she, artfully\navoiding my question, insisted on our immediate return. Being in a\nquandary as to what to say or do, I went after the horses, which was a\nsimple proposition. On my return, while we were adjusting the garlands\nabout the necks of our mounts, I again urged her for an answer, but in\nvain. We stood for a moment between the two horses, and as I lowered my\nhand on my knee to afford her a stepping-stone in mounting, I thought\nshe did not offer to mount with the same alacrity as she had done\nbefore. Something flashed through my addled mind, and, withdrawing the\nhand proffered as a mounting block, I clasped the demure maiden closely\nin my arms. What transpired has no witnesses save two saddle horses,\nand as Wolf usually kept an eye on his rider in mounting, I dropped the\nreins and gave him his freedom rather than endure his scrutiny. When we\nwere finally aroused from this delicious trance, the horses had strayed\naway fully fifty yards, but I had received a favorable answer, breathed\nin a voice so low and tender that it haunts me yet.\n\nAs we rode along, returning to the grove, Esther requested that our\nbetrothal be kept a profound secret. No doubt she had good reasons, and\nit was quite possible that there then existed some complications which\nshe wished to conceal, though I avoided all mention of any possible\nrival. Since she was not due to return to her school before September,\nthere seemed ample time to carry out our intentions of marrying. But as\nwe jogged along, she informed me that after spending a few weeks with\nher sister in Oakville, it was her intention to return to the San\nMiguel for the summer. To allay her mother’s distrust, it would be\nbetter for me not to call at the ranch. But this was easily compensated\nfor when she suggested making several visits during the season with the\nVaux girls, chums of hers, who lived on the Frio about thirty miles due\nnorth of Las Palomas. This was fortunate, since the Vaux ranch and ours\nwere on the most friendly terms.\n\nWe returned by the route by which we had left the grounds. I repicketed\nthe horses and we were soon mingling again with the revelers, having\nbeen absent little over an hour. No one seemed to have taken any notice\nof our absence. Mrs. Martin, I rejoiced to see, was still in tow of her\nsister and Miss Jean, and from the circle of Las Palomas courtiers who\nsurrounded the ladies, I felt sure they had given her no opportunity\neven to miss her younger sister. Uncle Lance was the only member of our\ncompany absent, but I gave myself no uneasiness about him, since the\nmail contractors were both likewise missing. Rejoining our friends and\nassuming a nonchalant air, I flattered myself that my disguise was\nperfect.\n\nDuring the remainder of the afternoon, in view of the possibility that\nEsther might take her sister, Mrs. Martin, into our secret and win her\nas an ally, I cultivated that lady’s acquaintance, dancing with her and\nleaving nothing undone to foster her friendship. Near the middle of the\nafternoon, as the three sisters, Miss Jean, and I were indulging in\nlight refreshment at a booth some distance from the dancing arbor, I\nsighted my employer, Dan Happersett, and the two stage men returning\nfrom the store. They passed near, not observing us, and from the\ndefiant tones of Uncle Lance’s voice, I knew they had been tampering\nwith the ‘private stock’ of the merchant at Shepherd’s. “Why,\ngentlemen,” said he, “that ambulance team is no exception to the\nquality of mules I’m raising at Las Palomas. Drive up some time and\nspend a few days and take a look at the stock we’re breeding. If you\nwill, and I don’t show you fifty mules fourteen and a half hands or\nbetter, I’ll round up five hundred head and let you pick fifty as a\npelon for your time and trouble. Why, gentlemen, Las Palomas has sold\nmules to the government.”\n\nOn the return of our party to the arbor, Happersett claimed a dance\nwith Esther, thus freeing me. Uncle Lance was standing some little\ndistance away, still entertaining the mail contractors, and I edged\nnear enough to notice Oxenford’s florid face and leery eye. But on my\nemployer’s catching sight of me, he excused himself to the stage men,\nand taking my arm led me off. Together we promenaded out of sight of\nthe crowd. “How do you like my style of a man herder?” inquired the old\nmatchmaker, once we were out of hearing. “Why, Tom, I’d have held those\nmail thieves until dark, if Dan hadn’t drifted in and given me the\nwink. Shepherd kicked like a bay steer on letting me have a second\nquart bottle, but it took that to put the right glaze in the young\nYank’s eye. Oh, I had him going south all right! But tell me, how did\nyou and Esther make it?”\n\nWe had reached a secluded spot, and, seating ourselves on an old fallen\ntree trunk, I told of my success, even to the using of his horse. Never\nbefore or since did I see Uncle Lance give way to such a fit of\nhilarity as he indulged in over the perfect working out of our plans.\nWith his hat he whipped me, the ground, the log on which we sat, while\nhis peals of laughter rang out like the reports of a rifle. In his fit\nof ecstasy, tears of joy streaming from his eyes, he kept repeating\nagain and again, “Oh, sister, run quick and tell pa to come!”\n\nAs we neared the grounds returning, he stopped me and we had a further\nbrief confidential talk together. I was young and egotistical enough to\nthink that I could defy all the rivals in existence, but he cautioned\nme, saying: “Hold on, Tom. You’re young yet; you know nothing about the\nweaker sex, absolutely nothing. It’s not your fault, but due to your\nmere raw youth. Now, listen to me, son: Don’t underestimate any rival,\nparticularly if he has gall and money, most of all, money. Humanity is\nthe same the world over, and while you may not have seen it here among\nthe ranches, it is natural for a woman to rave over a man with money,\neven if he is only a pimply excuse for a creature. Still, I don’t see\nthat we have very much to fear. We can cut old lady McLeod out of the\nmatter entirely. But then there’s the girl’s sister, Mrs. Martin, and I\nlook for her to cut up shameful when she smells the rat, which she’s\nsure to do. And then there’s her husband to figure on. If the ox knows\nhis master’s crib, it’s only reasonable to suppose that Jack Martin\nknows where his bread and butter comes from. These stage men will stick\nup for each other like thieves. Now, don’t you be too crack sure. Be\njust a trifle leary of every one, except, of course, the Las Palomas\noutfit.”\n\nI admit that I did not see clearly the reasoning behind much of this\nlecture, but I knew better than reject the advice of the old matchmaker\nwith his sixty odd years of experience. I was still meditating over his\nremarks when we rejoined the crowd and were soon separated among the\ndancers. Several urged me to play the violin; but I was too busy\nlooking after my own fences, and declined the invitation. Casting about\nfor the Vaux girls, I found the eldest, with whom I had a slight\nacquaintance, being monopolized by Theodore Quayle and John Cotton,\nfriendly rivals and favorites of the young lady. On my imploring the\nfavor of a dance, she excused herself, and joined me on a promenade\nabout the grounds, missing one dance entirely. In arranging matters\nwith her to send me word on the arrival of Esther at their ranch, I\nattempted to make her show some preference between my two comrades,\nunder the pretense of knowing which one to bring along, but she only\nsmiled and maintained an admirable neutrality.\n\nAfter a dance I returned the elder Miss Vaux to the tender care of John\nCotton, and caught sight of my employer leaving the arbor for the\nrefreshment booth with a party of women, including Mrs. Martin and\nEsther McLeod, to whom he was paying the most devoted attention.\nWitnessing the tireless energy of the old matchmaker, and in a quarter\nwhere he had little hope of an ally, brought me to thinking that there\nmight be good cause for alarm in his warnings not to be overconfident.\nMiss Jean, whom I had not seen since luncheon, aroused me from my\nreverie, and on her wishing to know my motive for cultivating the\nacquaintance of Miss Vaux and neglecting my own sweetheart, I told her\nthe simple truth. “Good idea, Tom,” she assented. “I think I’ll just\nask Miss Frances home with me to spend Sunday. Then you can take her\nacross to the Frio on horseback, so as not to offend either John or\nTheodore. What do you think?”\n\nI thought it was a good idea, and said so. At least the taking of the\nyoung lady home would be a pleasanter task for me than breaking horses.\nBut as I expressed myself so, I could not help thinking, seeing Miss\nJean’s zeal in the matter, that the matchmaking instinct was equally\nwell developed on both sides of the Lovelace family.\n\nThe afternoon was drawing to a close. The festivities would conclude by\nearly sundown. Miss Jean would spend the night again at the halfway\nranch, returning to Las Palomas the next morning; we would start on our\nreturn with the close of the amusements. Many who lived at a distance\nhad already started home. It lacked but a few minutes of the closing\nhour when I sought out Esther for the “Home, Sweet Home” waltz, finding\nher in company of Oxenford, chaperoned by Mrs. Martin, of which there\nwas need. My sweetheart excused herself with a poise that made my heart\nleap, and as we whirled away in the mazes of the final dance, rivals\nand all else passed into oblivion. Before we could realize the change\nin the music, the orchestra had stopped, and struck into “My Country,\n’tis of Thee,” in which the voice of every patriotic Texan present\nswelled the chorus until it echoed throughout the grove, befittingly\nclosing San Jacinto Day.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\nA CAT HUNT ON THE FRIO\n\n\nThe return of Miss Jean the next forenoon, accompanied by Frances Vaux,\nwas an occasion of more than ordinary moment at Las Palomas. The Vaux\nfamily were of creole extraction, but had settled on the Frio River\nnearly a generation before. Under the climatic change, from the swamps\nof Louisiana to the mesas of Texas, the girls grew up fine physical\nspecimens of rustic Southern beauty. To a close observer, certain\ntraces of the French were distinctly discernible in Miss Frances,\nnotably in the large, lustrous eyes, the swarthy complexion, and early\nmaturity of womanhood. Small wonder then that our guest should have\nplayed havoc among the young men of the countryside, adding to her\ntrain of gallants the devoted Quayle and Cotton of Las Palomas.\n\nAside from her charming personality, that Miss Vaux should receive a\ncordial welcome at Las Palomas goes without saying, since there were\nmany reasons why she should. The old ranchero and his sister chaperoned\nthe young lady, while I, betrothed to another, became her most obedient\nslave. It is needless to add that there was a fair field and no favor\nshown by her hosts, as between John and Theodore. The prize was worthy\nof any effort. The best man was welcome to win, while the blessings of\nmaster and mistress seemed impatient to descend on the favored one.\n\nIn the work in hand, I was forced to act as a rival to my friends, for\nI could not afford to lower my reputation for horsemanship before Miss\nFrances, when my betrothed was shortly to be her guest. So it was not\nto be wondered at that Quayle and Cotton should abandon the _medeno_ in\nmounting their unbroken geldings, and I had to follow suit or suffer by\ncomparison. The other rascals, equal if not superior to our trio in\nhorsemanship, including Enrique, born with just sense enough to be a\nfearless vaquero, took to the heavy sand in mounting vicious geldings;\nbut we three jauntily gave the wildest horses their heads and even\nencouraged them to buck whenever our guest was sighted on the gallery.\nWhat gave special vim to our work was the fact that Miss Frances was a\nhorsewoman herself, and it was with difficulty that she could be kept\naway from the corrals. Several times a day our guest prevailed on Uncle\nLance to take her out to witness the roping. From a safe vantage place\non the palisades, the old ranchero and his protégé would watch us\ncatching, saddling, and mounting the geldings. Under those bright eyes,\nlariats encircled the feet of the horse to be ridden deftly indeed, and\nhe was laid on his side in the sand as daintily as a mother would lay\nher babe in its crib. Outside of the trio, the work of the gang was\nbunglesome, calling for many a protest from Uncle Lance,—they had no\nlady’s glance to spur them on,—while ours merited the enthusiastic\nplaudits of Miss Frances.\n\n\n[Illustration: GAVE THE WILDEST HORSES THEIR HEADS]\n\n\nThen came Sunday and we observed the commandment. Miss Jean had planned\na picnic for the day on the river. We excused Tiburcio, and pressed the\nambulance team into service to convey the party of six for the day’s\nouting among the fine groves of elm that bordered the river in several\nplaces, and afforded ample shade from the sun. The day was delightfully\nspent. The chaperons were negligent and dilatory. Uncle Lance even fell\nasleep for several hours. But when we returned at twilight, the\nambulance mules were garlanded as if for a wedding party.\n\nThe next morning our guest was to depart, and to me fell the pleasant\ntask of acting as her escort. Uncle Lance prevailed on Miss Frances to\nride a spirited chestnut horse from his mount, while I rode a _grulla_\nfrom my own. We made an early start, the old ranchero riding with us as\nfar as the river. As he held the hand of Miss Vaux in parting, he\ncautioned her not to detain me at their ranch, as he had use for me at\nLas Palomas. “Of course,” said he, “I don’t mean that you shall hurry\nhim right off to-day or even to-morrow. But these lazy rascals of mine\nwill hang around a girl a week, if she’ll allow it. Had John or\nTheodore taken you home, I shouldn’t expect to see either of them in a\nfortnight. Now, if they don’t treat you right at home, come back and\nlive with us. I’ll adopt you as my daughter. And tell your pa that the\nfirst general rain that falls, I’m coming over with my hounds for a cat\nhunt with him. Good-by, sweetheart.”\n\nIt was a delightful ride across to the Frio. Mounted on two splendid\nhorses, we put the Nueces behind us as the hours passed. Frequently we\nmet large strings of cattle drifting in towards the river for their\ndaily drink, and Miss Frances insisted on riding through the cows,\nnoticing every brand as keenly as a vaquero on the lookout for strays\nfrom her father’s ranch. The young calves scampered out of our way, but\ntheir sedate mothers permitted us to ride near enough to read the\nbrands as we met and passed. Once we rode a mile out of our way to look\nat a _manada_. The stallion met us as we approached as if to challenge\nall intruders on his domain, but we met him defiantly and he turned\naside and permitted us to examine his harem and its frolicsome colts.\n\nBut when cattle and horses no longer served as a subject, and the wide\nexpanse of flowery mesa, studded here and there with Spanish daggers\nwhose creamy flowers nodded to us as we passed, ceased to interest us,\nwe turned to the ever interesting subject of sweethearts. But try as I\nmight, I could never wring any confession from her which even suggested\na preference among her string of admirers. On the other hand, when she\ntwitted me about Esther, I proudly plead guilty of a Platonic\nfriendship which some day I hoped would ripen into something more\npermanent, fully realizing that the very first time these two chums met\nthere would be an interchange of confidences. And in the full knowledge\nthat during these whispered admissions the truth would be revealed, I\nstoutly denied that Esther and I were even betrothed.\n\nBut during that morning’s ride I made a friend and ally of Frances\nVaux. There was some talk of a tournament to be held during the summer\nat Campbellton on the Atascosa. She promised that she would detain\nEsther for it and find a way to send me word, and we would make up a\nparty and attend it together. I had never been present at any of these\npastoral tourneys and was hopeful that one would be held within reach\nof our ranch, for I had heard a great deal about them and was anxious\nto see one. But this was only one of several social outings which she\noutlined as on her summer programme, to all of which I was cordially\ninvited as a member of her party. There was to be a dance on St. John’s\nDay at the Mission, a barbecue in June on the San Miguel, and other\nlocal meets for the summer and early fall. By the time we reached the\nranch, I was just beginning to realize that, socially, Shepherd’s Ferry\nand the Nueces was a poky place.\n\nThe next morning I returned to Las Palomas. The horse-breaking was\nnearing an end. During the month of May we went into camp on a new\ntract of land which had been recently acquired, to build a tank on a\ndry _arroyo_ which crossed this last landed addition to the ranch. It\nwas a commercial peculiarity of Uncle Lance to acquire land but never\nto part with it under any consideration. To a certain extent, cows and\nland had become his religion, and whenever either, adjoining Las\nPalomas, was for sale, they were looked upon as a safe bank of deposit\nfor any surplus funds. The last tract thus secured was dry, but by\ndamming the _arroyo_ we could store water in this tank or reservoir to\ntide over the dry spells. All the Mexican help on the ranch was put to\nwork with wheelbarrows, while six mule teams ploughed, scraped, and\nhauled rock, one four-mule team being constantly employed in hauling\nwater over ten miles for camp and stock purposes. This dry stream ran\nwater, when conditions were favorable, several months in the year, and\nby building the tank our cattle capacity would be largely increased.\n\nOne evening, late in the month, when the water wagon returned, Tiburcio\nbrought a request from Miss Jean, asking me to come into the ranch that\nnight. Responding to the summons, I was rewarded by finding a letter\nawaiting me from Frances Vaux, left by a vaquero passing from the Frio\nto Santa Maria. It was a dainty missive, informing me that Esther was\nher guest; that the tournament would not take place, but to be sure and\ncome over on Sunday. Personally the note was satisfactory, but that I\nwas to bring any one along was artfully omitted. Being thus forced to\nread between the lines, on my return to camp the next morning by dawn,\nwithout a word of explanation, I submitted the matter to John and\nTheodore. Uncle Lance, of course, had to know what had called me in to\nthe ranch, and, taking the letter from Quayle, read it himself.\n\n“That’s plain enough,” said he, on the first reading. “John will go\nwith you Sunday, and if it rains next month, I’ll take Theodore with me\nwhen I go over for a cat hunt with old man Pierre. I’ll let him act as\nmaster of the horse,—no, of the hounds,—and give him a chance to toot\nhis own horn with Frances. Honest, boys, I’m getting disgusted with the\nwhite element of Las Palomas. We raise most everything here but white\nbabies. Even Enrique, the rascal, has to live in camp now to hold down\nhis breakfast. But you young whites—with the country just full of young\nwomen—well, it’s certainly discouraging. I do all I can, and Sis helps\na little, but what does it amount to—what are the results? That poem\nthat Jean reads to us occasionally must be right. I reckon the\nCaucasian is played out.”\n\nBefore the sun was an hour high, John Cotton and myself rode into the\nVaux ranch on Sunday morning. The girls gave us a cheerful welcome.\nWhile we were breakfasting, several other lads and lasses rode up, and\nwe were informed that a little picnic for the day had been arranged. As\nthis was to our liking, John and I readily acquiesced, and shortly\nafterward a mounted party of about a dozen young folks set out for a\nhackberry grove, up the river several miles. Lunch baskets were taken\nalong, but no chaperons. The girls were all dressed in cambric and\nmuslin and as light in heart as the fabrics and ribbons they flaunted.\nI was gratified with the boldness of Cotton, as he cantered away with\nFrances, and with the day before him there was every reason to believe\nthat his cause would he advanced. As to myself, with Esther by my side\nthe livelong day, I could not have asked the world to widen an inch.\n\nIt was midnight when we reached Las Palomas returning. As we rode along\nthat night, John confessed to me that Frances was a tantalizing enigma.\nUp to a certain point, she offered every encouragement, but beyond that\nthere seemed to be a dead line over which she allowed no sentiment to\npass. It was plain to be seen that he was discouraged, but I told him I\nhad gone through worse ordeals.\n\nThroughout southern Texas and the country tributary to the Nueces\nRiver, we always looked for our heaviest rainfall during the month of\nJune. This year in particular, we were anxious to see a regular\ndownpour to start the _arroyo_ and test our new tank. Besides, we had\nsold for delivery in July, twelve hundred beef steers for shipment at\nRockport on the coast. If only a soaking rain would fall, making water\nplentiful, we could make the drive in little over a hundred miles,\nwhile a dry season would compel; us to follow the river nearly double\nthe distance.\n\nWe were riding our range thoroughly, locating our fattest beeves, when\none evening as June Deweese and I were on the way back from the Ganso,\na regular equinoctial struck us, accompanied by a downpour of rain and\nhail. Our horses turned their backs to the storm, but we drew slickers\nover our heads, and defied the elements. Instead of letting up as\ndarkness set in, the storm seemed to increase in fury and we were\nforced to seek shelter. We were at least fifteen miles from the ranch,\nand it was simply impossible to force a horse against that sheeting\nrain. So turning to catch the storm in our backs, we rode for a\nranchita belonging to Las Palomas. By the aid of flashes of lightning\nand the course of the storm, we reached the little ranch and found a\nhaven. A steady rain fell all night, continuing the next day, but we\nsaddled early and rode for our new reservoir on the _arroyo_. Imagine\nour surprise on sighting the embankment to see two horsemen ride up\nfrom the opposite direction and halt at the dam. Giving rein to our\nhorses and galloping up, we found they were Uncle Lance and Theodore\nQuayle. Above the dam the _arroyo_ was running like a mill-tail. The\nwater in the reservoir covered several acres and had backed up stream\nnearly a quarter mile, the deepest point in the tank reaching my saddle\nskirts. The embankment had settled solidly, holding the gathering water\nto our satisfaction, and after several hours’ inspection we rode for\nhome.\n\nWith this splendid rain, Las Palomas ranch took on an air of activity.\nThe old ranchero paced the gallery for hours in great glee, watching\nthe downpour. It was too soon yet by a week to gather the beeves. But\nunder the glowing prospect, we could not remain inert. The next morning\nthe _segunão_ took all the teams and returned to the tank to watch the\ndam and haul rock to rip-rap the flanks of the embankment. Taking extra\nsaddle horses with us, Uncle Lance, Dan Happersett, Quayle, and myself\ntook the hounds and struck across for the Frio. On reaching the Vaux\nranch, as showers were still falling and the underbrush reeking with\nmoisture, wetting any one to the skin who dared to invade it, we did\nnot hunt that afternoon. Pierre Vaux was enthusiastic over the rain,\nwhile his daughters were equally so over the prospects of riding to the\nhounds, there being now nearly forty dogs in the double pack.\n\nAt the first opportunity, Frances confided to me that Mrs. McLeod had\nforbidden Esther visiting them again, since some busybody had carried\nthe news of our picnic to her ears. But she promised me that if I could\ndirect the hunt on the morrow within a few miles of the McLeod ranch,\nshe would entice my sweetheart out and give me a chance to meet her.\nThere was a roguish look in Miss Frances’s eye during this disclosure\nwhich I was unable to fathom, but I promised during the few days’ hunt\nto find some means to direct the chase within striking distance of the\nranch on the San Miguel.\n\nI promptly gave this bit of news in confidence to Uncle Lance, and was\ntold to lie low and leave matters to him. That evening, amid clouds of\ntobacco smoke, the two old rancheros discussed the best hunting in the\ncountry, while we youngsters danced on the gallery to the strains of a\nfiddle. I heard Mr. Vaux narrating a fight with a cougar which killed\ntwo of his best dogs during the winter just passed, and before we\nretired it was understood that we would give the haunts of this same\nold cougar our first attention.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\nTHE ROSE AND ITS THORN\n\n\nDawn found the ranch astir and a heavy fog hanging over the Frio\nvalley. Don Pierre had a _remuda_ corralled before sun-up, and insisted\non our riding his horses, an invitation which my employer alone\ndeclined. For the first hour or two the pack scouted the river bottoms\nwith no success, and Uncle Lance’s verdict was that the valley was too\nsoggy for any animal belonging to the cat family, so we turned back to\nthe divide between the Frio and San Miguel. Here there grew among the\nhills many Guajio thickets, and from the first one we beat, the hounds\nopened on a hot trail in splendid chorus. The pack led us through\nthickets for over a mile, when they suddenly turned down a ravine,\nheading for the river. With the ground ill splendid condition for\ntrailing, the dogs in full cry, the quarry sought every shelter\npossible; but within an hour of striking the scent, the pack came to\nbay in the encinal. On coming up with the hounds, we found the animal\nwas a large catamount. A single shot brought him from his perch in a\nscraggy oak, and the first chase of the day was over. The pelt was\nworthless and was not taken.\n\nIt was nearly noon when the kill was made, and Don Pierre insisted that\nwe return to the ranch. Uncle Lance protested against wasting the\nremainder of the day, but the courteous Creole urged that the ground\nwould be in fine condition for hunting at least a week longer; this\nhunt he declared was merely preliminary—to break the pack together and\ngive them a taste of the chase before attacking the cougar. “Ah,” said\nDon Pierre, with a deprecating shrug of the shoulders, “you have\nnothing to hurry you home. I come by your rancho an’ stay one hol’\nweek. You come by mine, al’ time hurry. Sacré! Let de li’l dogs rest,\nan’ in de mornin’, mebbe we hunt de cougar. Ah, Meester Lance, we must\nhaff de pack fresh for him. By Gar, he was one dam’ wil’ fellow. Mek\none two pass, so. Biff! two dog dead.”\n\nUncle Lance yielded, and we rode back to the ranch. The next morning\nour party included the three daughters of our host. Don Pierre led the\nway on a roan stallion, and after two hours’ riding we crossed the San\nMiguel to the north of his ranch. A few miles beyond we entered some\nchalky hills, interspersed with white chaparral thickets which were\njust bursting into bloom, with a fragrance that was almost\nintoxicating. Under the direction of our host, we started to beat a\nlong chain of these thickets, and were shortly rewarded by hearing the\npack give mouth. The quarry kept to the cover of the thickets for\nseveral miles, impeding the chase until the last covert in the chain\nwas reached, where a fight occurred with the lead hound. Don Pierre was\nthe first to reach the scene, and caught several glimpses of a monster\npuma as he slunk away through the Brazil brush, leaving one of the\nDon’s favorite hounds lacerated to the bone. But the pack passed on,\nand, lifting the wounded dog to a vaquero’s saddle, we followed,\nlustily shouting to the hounds.\n\nThe spoor now turned down the San Miguel, and the pace was such that it\ntook hard riding to keep within hearing. Mr. Vaux and Uncle Lance\nusually held the lead, the remainder of the party, including the girls,\nbringing up the rear. The chase continued down stream for fully an\nhour, until we encountered some heavy timber on the main Frio, our\ncourse having carried us several miles to the north of the McLeod\nranch. Some distance below the juncture with the San Miguel the river\nmade a large horseshoe, embracing nearly a thousand acres, which was\ncovered with a dense growth of ash, pecan, and cypress. The trail led\ninto this jungle, circling it several times before leading away. We\nwere fortunately able to keep track of the chase from the baying of the\nhounds without entering the timber, and were watching its course, when\nsuddenly it changed; the pack followed the scent across a bridge of\ndriftwood on the Frio, and started up the river in full cry.\n\nAs the chase down the San Miguel passed beyond the mouth of the creek,\nTheodore Quayle and Frances Vaux dropped out and rode for the McLeod\nranch. It was still early in the day, and understanding their motive, I\nknew they would rejoin us if their mission was successful. By the\nsudden turn of the chase, we were likely to pass several miles south of\nthe home of my sweetheart, but our location could be easily followed by\nthe music of the pack. Within an hour after leaving us, Theodore and\nFrances rejoined the chase, adding Tony Hunter and Esther to our\nnumbers. With this addition, I lost interest in the hunt, as the course\ncarried us straightaway five miles up the stream. The quarry was\ncunning and delayed the pack at every thicket or large body of timber\nencountered. Several times he craftily attempted to throw the hounds\noff the scent by climbing leaning trees, only to spring down again. But\nthe pack were running wide and the ruse was only tiring the hunted. The\nscent at times left the river and circled through outlying mesquite\ngroves, always keeping well under cover. On these occasions we rested\nour horses, for the hunt was certain to return to the river.\n\nFrom the scattering order in which we rode, I was afforded a good\nopportunity for free conversation with Esther. But the information I\nobtained was not very encouraging. Her mother’s authority had grown so\nsevere that existence under the same roof was a mere armistice between\nmother and daughter, while this day’s sport was likely to break the\nalready strained relations. The thought that her suffering was largely\non my account, nerved me to resolution.\n\nThe kill was made late in the day, in a bend of the river, about\nfifteen miles above the Vaux ranch, forming a jungle of several\nthousand acres. In this thickety covert the fugitive made his final\nstand, taking refuge in an immense old live-oak, the mossy festoons of\nwhich partially screened him from view. The larger portion of the\ncavalcade remained in the open, but the rest of us, under the\nleadership of the two rancheros, forced our horses through the\nunderbrush and reached the hounds. The pack were as good as exhausted\nby the long run, and, lest the animal should spring out of the tree and\nescape, we circled it at a distance. On catching a fair view of the\nquarry, Uncle Lance called for a carbine. Two shots through the\nshoulders served to loosen the puma’s footing, when he came down by\neasy stages from limb to limb, spitting and hissing defiance into the\nupturned faces of the pack. As he fell, we dashed in to beat off the\ndogs as a matter of precaution, but the bullets had done their work,\nand the pack mouthed the fallen feline with entire impunity.\n\nDan Happersett dragged the dead puma out with a rope over the neck for\nthe inspection of the girls, while our horses, which had had no less\nthan a fifty-mile ride, were unsaddled and allowed a roll and a half\nhour’s graze before starting back. As we were watering our mounts, I\ncaught my employer’s ear long enough to repeat what I had learned about\nEsther’s home difficulties. After picketing our horses, we strolled\naway from the remainder of the party, when Uncle Lance remarked: “Tom,\nyour chance has come where you must play your hand and play it boldly.\nI’ll keep Tony at the Vaux ranch, and if Esther has to go home\nto-night, why, of course, you’ll have to take her. There’s your chance\nto run off and marry. Now, Tom, you’ve never failed me yet; and this\nthing has gone far enough. We’ll give old lady McLeod good cause to\nhate us from now on. I’ve got some money with me, and I’ll rob the\nother boys, and to-night you make a spoon or spoil a horn. Sabe?”\n\nI understood and approved. As we jogged along homeward, Esther and I\nfell to the rear, and I outlined my programme. Nor did she protest when\nI suggested that to-night was the accepted time. Before we reached the\nVaux ranch every little detail was arranged. There was a splendid moon,\nand after supper she plead the necessity of returning home. Meanwhile\nevery cent my friends possessed had been given me, and the two best\nhorses of Las Palomas were under saddle for the start. Uncle Lance was\narranging a big hunt for the morrow with Tony Hunter and Don Pierre,\nwhen Esther took leave of her friends, only a few of whom were\ncognizant of our intended elopement.\n\nWith fresh mounts under us, we soon covered the intervening distance\nbetween the two ranches. I would gladly have waived touching at the\nMcLeod ranch, but Esther had torn her dress during the day and insisted\non a change, and I, of necessity, yielded. The corrals were at some\ndistance from the main buildings, and, halting at a saddle shed\nadjoining, Esther left me and entered the house. Fortunately her mother\nhad retired, and after making a hasty change of apparel, she returned\nunobserved to the corrals. As we quietly rode out from the inclosure,\nmy spirits soared to the moon above us. The night was an ideal one.\nCrossing the Frio, we followed the divide some distance, keeping in the\nopen, and an hour before midnight forded the Nueces at Shepherd’s. A\nflood of recollections crossed my mind, as our steaming horses bent\ntheir heads to drink at the ferry. Less than a year before, in this\nvery grove, I had met her; it was but two months since, on those hills\nbeyond, we had gathered flowers, plighted our troth, and exchanged our\nfirst rapturous kiss. And the thought that she was renouncing home and\nall for my sake, softened my heart and nerved me to every exertion.\n\nOur intention was to intercept the south-bound stage at the first road\nhouse south of Oakville. I knew the hour it was due to leave the\nstation, and by steady riding we could connect with it at the first\nstage stand some fifteen miles below. Lighthearted and happy, we set\nout on this last lap of our ride. Our horses seemed to understand the\nemergency, as they put the miles behind them, thrilling us with their\nenergy and vigor. Never for a moment in our flight did my sweetheart\ndiscover a single qualm over her decision, while in my case all\nscruples were buried in the hope of victory. Recrossing the Nueces and\nentering the stage road, we followed it down several miles, sighting\nthe stage stand about two o’clock in the morning. I was saddle weary\nfrom the hunt, together with this fifty-mile ride, and rejoiced in\nreaching our temporary destination. Esther, however, seemed little the\nworse for the long ride.\n\nThe welcome extended by the keeper of this relay station was gruff\nenough. But his tone and manner moderated when he learned we were\npassengers for Corpus Christi. When I made arrangements with him to\nlook after our horses for a week or ten days at a handsome figure, he\nbecame amiable, invited us to a cup of coffee, and politely informed us\nthat the stage was due in half an hour. But on its arrival, promptly on\ntime, our hearts sank within us. On the driver’s box sat an express\nguard holding across his knees a sawed-off, double-barreled shotgun. As\nit halted, two other guards stepped out of the coach, similarly armed.\nThe stage was carrying an unusual amount of treasure, we were informed,\nand no passengers could be accepted, as an attempted robbery was\nexpected between this and the next station.\n\nOur situation became embarrassing. For the first time during our ride,\nEsther showed the timidity of her sex. The chosen destination of our\nhoneymoon, nearly a hundred miles to the south, was now out of the\nquestion. To return to Oakville, where a sister and friends of my\nsweetheart resided, seemed the only avenue open. I had misgivings that\nit was unsafe, but Esther urged it, declaring that Mrs. Martin would\noffer no opposition, and even if she did, nothing now could come that\nwould ever separate us. We learned from the keeper that Jack Martin was\ndue to drive the north-bound stage out of Oakville that morning, and\nwas expected to pass this relay station about daybreak. This was\nfavorable, and we decided to wait and allow the stage to pass north\nbefore resuming our journey.\n\nOn the arrival of the stage, we learned that the down coach had been\nattacked, but the robbers, finding it guarded, had fled after an\nexchange of shots in the darkness. This had a further depressing effect\non my betrothed, and only my encouragement to be brave and face the\ndilemma confronting us kept her up. Bred on the frontier, this little\nranch girl was no weakling; but the sudden overturn of our well-laid\nplans had chilled my own spirits as well as hers. Giving the up stage a\ngood start of us, we resaddled and started for Oakville, slightly\ncrestfallen but still confident. In the open air Esther’s fears\ngradually subsided, and, invigorated by the morning and the gallop, we\nreached our destination after our night’s adventure with hopes buoyant\nand colors flying.\n\nMrs. Martin looked a trifle dumfounded at her early callers, but I lost\nno time in informing her that our mission was an elopement, and asked\nher approval and blessing. Surprised as she was, she welcomed us to\nbreakfast, inquiring of our plans and showing alarm over our\nexperience. Since Oakville was a county seat where a license could be\nsecured, for fear of pursuit I urged an immediate marriage, but Mrs.\nMartin could see no necessity for haste. There was, she said, no one\nthere whom she would allow to solemnize a wedding of her sister, and,\nto my chagrin, Esther agreed with her.\n\nThis was just what I had dreaded; but Mrs. Martin, with apparent\nenthusiasm over our union, took the reins in her own hands, and decided\nthat we should wait until Jack’s return, when we would all take the\nstage to Pleasanton, where an Episcopal minister lived. My heart sank\nat this, for it meant a delay of two days, and I stood up and stoutly\nprotested. But now that the excitement of our flight had abated, my own\nEsther innocently sided with her sister, and I was at my wit’s end. To\nall my appeals, the sisters replied with the argument that there was no\nhurry—that while the hunt lasted at the Vaux ranch Tony Hunter could be\ndepended upon to follow the hounds; Esther would never be missed until\nhis return; her mother would suppose she was with the Vaux girls, and\nwould be busy preparing a lecture against her return.\n\nOf course the argument of the sisters won the hour. Though dreading\nsome unforeseen danger, I temporarily yielded. I knew the motive of the\nhunt well enough to know that the moment we had an ample start it would\nbe abandoned, and the Las Palomas contingent would return to the ranch.\nYet I dare not tell, even my betrothed, that there were ulterior\nmotives in my employer’s hunting on the Frio, one of which was to\nafford an opportunity for our elopement. Full of apprehension and\nalarm, I took a room at the village hostelry, for I had our horses to\nlook after, and secured a much-needed sleep during the afternoon. That\nevening I returned to the Martin cottage, to urge again that we carry\nout our original programme by taking the south-bound stage at midnight.\nBut all I could say was of no avail. Mrs. Martin was equal to every\nsuggestion. She had all the plans outlined, and there was no occasion\nfor me to do any thinking at all. Corpus Christi was not to be\nconsidered for a single moment, compared to Pleasanton and an\nEpiscopalian service. What could I do?\n\nAt an early hour Mrs. Martin withdrew. The reaction from our escapade\nhad left a pallor on my sweetheart’s countenance, almost alarming.\nNoticing this, I took my leave early, hoping that a good night’s rest\nwould restore her color and her spirits. Returning to the hostelry, I\nresignedly sought my room, since there was nothing I could do but wait.\nTossing and pitching on my bed, I upbraided myself for having returned\nto Oakville, where any interference with our plans could possibly\ndevelop.\n\nThe next morning at breakfast, I noticed that I was the object of\nparticular attention, and of no very kindly sort. No one even gave me a\nfriendly nod, while several avoided my glances. Supposing that some\nrumor of our elopement might be abroad, I hurriedly finished my meal\nand started for the Martins’. On reaching the door, I was met by its\nmistress, who, I had need to remind myself, was the sister of my\nbetrothed. To my friendly salutation, she gave me a scornful, withering\nlook.\n\n“You’re too late, young man,” she said. “Shortly after you left last\nnight, Esther and Jack Oxenford took a private conveyance for Beeville,\nand are married before this. You Las Palomas people are slow. Old Lance\nLovelace thought he was playing it cute San Jacinto Day, but I saw\nthrough his little game. Somebody must have told him he was a\nmatchmaker. Well, just give him my regards, and tell him he don’t know\nthe first principles of that little game. Tell him to drop in some time\nwhen he’s passing; I may be able to give him some pointers that I’m not\nusing at the moment. I hope your sorrow will not exceed my happiness.\nGood-morning, sir.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\nAFTERMATH\n\n\nMy memory of what happened immediately after Mrs. Martin’s contemptuous\ntreatment of me is as vague and indefinite as the vaporings of a\nfevered dream. I have a faint recollection of several friendly people\noffering their sympathy. The old stableman, who looked after the\nhorses, cautioned me not to start out alone; but I have since learned\nthat I cursed him and all the rest, and rode away as one in a trance.\nBut I must have had some little caution left, for I remember giving\nShepherd’s a wide berth, passing several miles to the south.\n\nThe horses, taking their own way, were wandering home. Any exercise of\ncontrol or guidance over them on my part was inspired by an instinct to\navoid being seen. Of conscious direction there was none. Somewhere\nbetween the ferry and the ranch I remember being awakened from my\ntorpor by the horse which I was leading showing an inclination to\ngraze. Then I noticed their gaunted condition, and in sympathy for the\npoor brutes unsaddled and picketed them in a secluded spot. What\nhappened at this halt has slipped from my memory. But I must have slept\na long time; for I awoke to find the moon high overhead, and my watch,\nthrough neglect, run down and stopped. I now realized the better my\npredicament, and reasoned with myself whether I should return to Las\nPalomas or not. But there was no place else to go, and the horses did\nnot belong to me. If I could only reach the ranch and secure my own\nhorse, I felt that no power on earth could chain me to the scenes of my\nhumiliation.\n\nThe horses decided me to return. Resaddling at an unknown hour, I rode\nfor the ranch. The animals were refreshed and made good time. As I rode\nalong I tried to convince myself that I could slip into the ranch,\nsecure my own saddle horse, and meet no one except the Mexicans. There\nwas a possibility that Deweese might still be in camp at the new\nreservoir, and I was hopeful that my employer might not yet be returned\nfrom the hunt on the Frio. After a number of hours’ riding, the horse\nunder saddle nickered. Halting him, I listened and heard the roosters\ncrowing in a chorus at the ranch. Clouds had obscured the moon, and so\nby making a detour around the home buildings I was able to reach the\nMexican quarters unobserved. I rode up to the house of Enrique, and\nquietly aroused him; told him my misfortune and asked him to hide me\nuntil he could get up my horse. We turned the animals loose, and,\ntaking my saddle inside the _jacal_, held a whispered conversation.\nDeweese was yet at the tank. If the hunting party had returned, they\nhad done so during the night. The distant range of my horse made it\nimpossible to get him before the middle of the forenoon, but Enrique\nand Doña Anita assured me that my slightest wish was law to them.\nFurnishing me with a blanket and pillow, they made me a couch on a dry\ncowskin on the dirt floor at the foot of their bed, and before day\nbroke I had fallen asleep.\n\nOn awakening, I found the sun had already risen. Enrique and his wife\nwere missing from the room, but a peep through a crevice in the\npalisade wall revealed Doña Anita in the kitchen adjoining. She had\ndetected my awakening, and soon brought me a cup of splendid coffee,\nwhich I drank with relish. She urged on me also some dainty dishes,\nwhich had always been favorites with me in Mexican cookery, but my\nappetite was gone. Throwing myself back on the cowskin, I asked Doña\nAnita how long Enrique had been gone in quest of my horse, and was\ninformed that he left before dawn, not even waiting for his customary\ncup of coffee. With the kindness of a sister, the girl wife urged me to\ntake their bed; but I assured her that comfort was the least of my\nconcerns, complete effacement being my consuming thought.\n\nDoña Anita withdrew, and as I lay pondering over the several possible\nroutes of escape, I heard a commotion in the ranch. I was in the act of\nrising when Doña Anita burst into the _jacal_ to tell me that Don Lance\nhad been sighted returning. I was on my feet in an instant, heard the\nlong-drawn notes of the horn calling in the hounds, and, peering\nthrough the largest crack, saw the cavalcade. As they approached,\ndriving their loose mounts in front of them, I felt that my ill luck\nstill hung over me; for among the unsaddled horses were the two which I\nhad turned free but a few hours before. The hunters had met the gaunted\nanimals between the ranch and the river, and were bringing them in to\nreturn them to their own _remuda_. But at the same time the horses were\nevidence that I was in the ranch. From the position of Uncle Lance, in\nadvance, I could see that he was riding direct to the house, and my\nabsence there would surely cause surprise. At best it was but a\nquestion of time until I was discovered.\n\nIn the face of this new development, I gave up. There was no escaping\nfate. Enrique might not return for two hours yet, and if he came,\ndriving in my horse, it would only prove my presence. I begged Doña\nAnita to throw open the door and conceal nothing. But she was still\nready to aid in my concealment until night, offering to deny my\npresence. But how could I conceal myself in a single room, and what was\nso simple a device to a worldly man of sixty years’ experience? To me\nthe case looked hopeless. Even before we had concluded our discussion,\nI saw Uncle Lance and the boys coming towards the Mexican quarters,\nfollowed by Miss Jean and the household contingent. The fact that the\ndoor of Enrique’s _jacal_ was closed, made it a shining mark for\ninvestigation. Opening the inner door, I started to meet the visitors;\nbut Doña Anita planted herself at the outer entrance of the stoop, met\nthe visitors, and within my hearing and without being asked stoutly\ndenied my presence. “Hush up, you little liar,” said a voice, and I\nheard a step and clanking spurs which I recognized. I had sat down on\nthe edge of the bed, and was rolling a cigarette as the crowd filed\ninto the _jacal_. A fortunate flush of anger came over me which served\nto steady my voice; but I met their staring, after all, much as if I\nhad been a culprit and they a vigilance committee.\n\n“Well, young fellow, explain your presence here,” demanded Uncle Lance.\nHad it not been for the presence of Miss Jean, I had on my tongue’s end\na reply, relative to the eleventh commandment, emphasized with\nsulphurous adjectives. But out of deference to the mistress of the\nranch, I controlled my anger, and, taking out of my pocket a flint, a\nsteel, and, a bit of _yesca,_ struck fire and leisurely lighted my\ncigarette. Throwing myself back on the bed, as my employer repeated his\ndemand, I replied, “Ask Anita.” The girl understood, and, nothing\nabashed, told the story in her native tongue, continually referring to\nme as _pobre Tomas_. When her disconnected narrative was concluded,\nUncle Lance turned on me, saying:—\n\n“And this is the result of all our plans. You went into Oakville, did\nyou? Tom, you haven’t, got as much sense as a candy frog. Walked right\ninto a trap with your head up and sassy. That’s right—don’t you listen\nto any one. Didn’t I tell you that stage people would stick by each\nother like thieves? And you forgot all my warnings and deliberately”—\n\n“Hold on,” I interrupted. “You must recollect that the horses had had a\nfifty-mile forced ride, were jaded, and on the point of collapse. With\nthe down stage refusing to carry us, and the girl on the point of\nhysteria, where else could I go?”\n\n“Go to jail if necessary. Go anywhere but the place you went. The\nhorses were jaded on a fifty-mile ride, were they? Either one of them\nwas good for a hundred without unsaddling, and you know it. Haven’t I\ntold you that this ranch would raise horses when we were all dead and\ngone? Suppose you had killed a couple of horses? What would that have\nbeen, compared to your sneaking into the ranch this way, like a whipped\ncur with your tail between your legs? Now, the countryside will laugh\nat us both.”\n\n“The country may laugh,” I answered, “but I’ll not be here to hear it.\nEnrique has gone after my horse, and as soon as he gets in I’m leaving\nyou for good.”\n\n“You’ll do nothing of the kind. You think you’re all shot to pieces,\ndon’t you? Well, you’ll stay right here until all your wounds heal.\nI’ve taken all these degrees myself, and have lived to laugh at them\nafterward. And I have had lessons that I hope you’ll never have to\nlearn. When I found out that my third wife had known a gambler before\nshe married me, I found out what the Bible means by rottenness of the\nbones with which it says an evil woman uncrowns her husband. I’ll tell\nyou about it some day. But you’ve not been scarred in this little\nside-play. You’re not even powder burnt. Why, in less than a month\nyou’ll be just as happy again as if you had good sense.”\n\nMiss Jean now interrupted. “Clear right out of here,” she said to her\nbrother and the rest. “Yes, the whole pack of you. I want to talk with\nTom alone. Yes, you too—you’ve said too much already. Run along out.”\n\nAs they filed out, I noticed Uncle Lance pick up my saddle and throw it\nacross his shoulder, while Theodore gathered up the rancid blankets and\nmy fancy bridle, taking everything with them to the house. Waiting\nuntil she saw that her orders were obeyed, Miss Jean came over and sat\ndown beside me on the bed. Anita stood like a fawn near the door,\nlikewise fearing banishment, but on a sign from her mistress she spread\na goatskin on the floor and sat down at our feet. Between two languages\nand two women, I was as helpless as an ironed prisoner. Not that Anita\nhad any influence over me, but the mistress of the ranch had. In her\nhands I was as helpless as a baby. I had come to the ranch a stranger\nonly a little over a year before, but had I been born there her\ninterest could have been no stronger. Jean Lovelace relinquished no\none, any more than a mother would one of her boys. I wanted to escape,\nto get away from observation; I even plead for a month’s leave of\nabsence. But my reasons were of no avail, and after arguing pro and con\nfor over an hour, I went with her to the house. If the Almighty ever\nmade a good woman and placed her among men for their betterment, then\nthe presence of Jean Lovelace at Las Palomas savored of divine\nappointment.\n\nOn reaching the yard, we rested a long time on a settee under a group\nof china trees. The boys had dispersed, and after quite a friendly chat\ntogether, we saw Uncle Lance sauntering out of the house, smiling as he\napproached. “Tom’s going to stay,” said Miss Jean to her brother, as\nthe latter seated himself beside us; “but this abuse and blame you’re\nheaping on him must stop. He did what he thought was best under the\ncircumstances, and you don’t know what they were. He has given me his\npromise to stay, and I have given him mine that talk about this matter\nwill be dropped. Now that your anger has cooled, and I have you both\ntogether, I want your word.”\n\n“Tom,” said my employer, throwing his long bony arm around me, “I was\ndisappointed, terribly put out, and I showed it in freeing my mind. But\nI feel better now—towards you, at least. I understand just how you felt\nwhen your plans were thwarted by an unforeseen incident. If I don’t\nknow everything, then, since the milk is spilt, I’m not asking for\nfurther particulars. If you did what you thought was best under the\ncircumstances, why, that’s all we ever ask of any one at Las Palomas. A\nmistake is nothing; my whole life is a series of errors. I’ve been\ntrying, and expect to keep right on trying, to give you youngsters the\nbenefit of my years; but if you insist on learning it for yourselves,\nwell enough. When I was your age, I took no one’s advice; but look how\nI’ve paid the fiddler. Possibly it was ordained otherwise, but it looks\nto me like a shame that I can’t give you boys the benefit of my dearly\nbought experience. But whether you take my advice or not, we’re going\nto be just as good friends as ever. I need young fellows like you on\nthis ranch. I’ve sent Dan out after Deweese, and to-morrow we’re going\nto commence gathering beeves. A few weeks’ good hard work will do you\nworlds of good. In less than a year, you’ll look back at this as a\nsplendid lesson. Shucks! boy, a man is a narrow, calloused creature\nuntil he has been shook up a few times by love affairs. They develop\nhim into the man he was intended to be. Come on into the house, Tom,\nand Jean will make us a couple of mint juleps.”\n\nWhat a blessed panacea for mental trouble is work! We were in the\nsaddle by daybreak the next morning, rounding up _remudas_. Every\navailable vaquero at the outlying ranchitas had been summoned. Dividing\nthe outfit and horses, Uncle Lance took twelve men and struck west for\nthe Ganso. With an equal number of men, Deweese pushed north for the\nFrio, which he was to work down below Shepherd’s, thence back along the\nhome river. From the ranch books, we knew there were fully two thousand\nbeeves over five years old in our brand. These cattle had never known\nan hour’s restraint since the day they were branded, and caution and\ncool judgment would be required in handling them. Since the contract\nonly required twelve hundred, we expected to make an extra clean\ngathering, using the oldest and naturally the largest beeves.\n\nDuring the week spent in gathering, I got the full benefit of every\npossible hour in the saddle. We reached the Ganso about an hour before\nsundown. The weather had settled; water was plentiful, and every one\nrealized that the work in hand would require wider riding than under\ndry conditions. By the time we had caught up fresh horses, the sun had\ngone down. “Boys,” said Uncle Lance, “we want to make a big rodeo on\nthe head of this creek in the morning. Tom, you take two vaqueros and\nlay off to the southwest about ten miles, and make a dry camp to-night.\nGlenn may have the same help to the southeast; and every rascal of you\nbe in your saddles by daybreak. There are a lot of big _ladino_ beeves\nin those brushy hills to the south and west. Be sure and be in your\nsaddles early enough to catch _all_ wild cattle out on the prairies. If\nyou want to, you can take a lunch in your pocket for breakfast. No; you\nneed no blankets—you’ll get up earlier if you sleep cold.”\n\nTaking José Pena and Pasquale Arispe with me, I struck off on our\ncourse in the gathering twilight. The first twitter of a bird in the\nmorning brought me to my feet; I roused the others, and we saddled and\nwere riding with the first sign of dawn in the east. Taking the outside\ncircle myself, I gave every bunch of cattle met on my course a good\nstart for the centre of the round-up. Pasquale and Jose followed\nseveral miles to my rear on inner circles, drifting on the cattle which\nI had started inward. As the sun arose, dispelling the morning mists, I\ncould see other cattle coming down in long strings out of the hills to\nthe eastward. Within an hour after starting, Gallup and I met. Our half\ncircle to the southward was perfect, and each turning back, we rode our\nappointed divisions until the vaqueros from the wagon were sighted,\nthrowing in cattle and closing up the northern portion of the circle.\nBefore the sun was two hours high, the first rodeo of the day was\ntogether, numbering about three thousand mixed cattle. In the few hours\nsince dawn, we had concentrated all animals in a territory at least\nfifteen miles in diameter.\n\nUncle Lance was in his element. Detailing two vaqueros to hold the beef\ncut within reach and a half dozen to keep the main herd compact, he\nordered the remainder of us to enter and begin the selecting of beeves.\nThere were a number of big wild steers in the round-up, but we left\nthose until the cut numbered over two hundred. When every hoof over\nfive years of age was separated, we had a nucleus for our beef herd\nnumbering about two hundred and forty steers. They were in fine\ncondition for grass cattle, and, turning the main herd free, we started\nour cut for the wagon, being compelled to ride wide of them as we\ndrifted down stream towards camp, as there were a number of old beeves\nwhich showed impatience at the restraint. But by letting them scatter\nwell, by the time they reached the wagon it required but two vaqueros\nto hold them.\n\nThe afternoon was but a repetition of the morning. Everything on the\nsouth side of the Nueces between the river and the wagon was thrown\ntogether on the second round-up of the day, which yielded less than two\nhundred cattle for our beef herd. But when we went into camp, dividing\ninto squads for night-herding, the day’s work was satisfactory to the\nranchero. Dan Happersett was given five vaqueros and stood the first\nwatch or until one A.M. Glenn Gallup and myself took the remainder of\nthe men and stood guard until morning. When Happersett called our guard\nan hour after midnight, he said to Gallup and me as we were pulling on\nour boots: “About a dozen big steers haven’t laid down. There’s only\none of them that has given any trouble. He’s a pinto that we cut in the\nfirst round-up in the morning. He has made two breaks already to get\naway, and if you don’t watch him close, he’ll surely give you the\nslip.”\n\nWhile riding to the relief, Glenn and I posted our vaqueros to be on\nthe lookout for the pinto beef. The cattle were intentionally bedded\nloose; but even in the starlight and waning moon, every man easily\nspotted the _ladino_ beef, uneasily stalking back and forth like a\ncaged tiger across the bed ground. A half hour before dawn, he made a\nfinal effort to escape, charging out between Gallup and the vaquero\nfollowing up on the same side. From the other side of the bed ground, I\nheard the commotion, but dare not leave the herd to assist. There was a\nmile of open country surrounding our camp, and if two men could not\nturn the beef on that space, it was useless for others to offer\nassistance. In the stillness of the morning hour, we could hear the\nrunning and see the flashes from six-shooters, marking the course of\nthe outlaw. After making a half circle, we heard them coming direct for\nthe herd. For fear of a stampede, we raised a great commotion around\nthe sleeping cattle; but in spite of our precaution, as the _ladino_\nbeef reëntered the herd, over half the beeves jumped to their feet and\nbegan milling. But we held them until dawn, and after scattering them\nover several hundred acres, left them grazing contentedly, when,\nleaving two vaqueros with the feeding herd, we went back to the wagon.\nThe camp had been astir some time, and when Glenn reported the incident\nof our watch, Uncle Lance said: “I thought I heard some shooting while\nI was cat-napping at daylight. Well, we can use a little fresh beef in\nthis very camp. We’ll kill him at noon. The wagon will move down near\nthe river this morning, so we can make three rodeos from it without\nmoving camp, and to-night we’ll have a side of Pinto’s ribs barbecued.\nMy mouth is watering this very minute for a rib roast.”\n\nThat morning after a big rodeo on the Nueces, well above the Ganso, we\nreturned to camp. Throwing into our herd the cut of less than a hundred\nsecured on the morning round-up, Uncle Lance, who had preceded us, rode\nout from the wagon with a carbine. Allowing the beeves to scatter, the\nold ranchero met and rode zigzagging through them until he came face to\nface with the pinto _ladino_. On noticing the intruding horseman, the\noutlaw threw up his head. There was a carbine report and the big fellow\nwent down in his tracks. By the time the herd had grazed away,\nTiburcio, who was cooking with our wagon, brought out all the knives,\nand the beef was bled, dressed, and quartered.\n\n“You can afford to be extravagant with this beef,” said Uncle Lance to\nthe old cook, when the quarters had been carried in to the wagon. “I’ve\nbeen ranching on this river nearly forty years, and I’ve always made it\na rule, where cattle cannot be safely handled, to beef them then and\nthere. I’ve sat up many a night barbecuing the ribs of a _ladino_. If\nyou have plenty of salt, Tiburcio, you can make a brine and jerk those\nhind quarters. It will make fine chewing for the boys on night herd\nwhen once we start for the coast.”\n\nFollowing down the home river, we made ten other rodeos before we met\nDeweese. We had something over a thousand beeves while he had less than\neight hundred. Throwing the two cuts together, we made a count, and cut\nback all the younger and smaller cattle until the herd was reduced to\nthe required number. Before my advent at Las Palomas, about the only\noutlet for beef cattle had been the canneries at Rockport and Fulton.\nBut these cattle were for shipment by boat to New Orleans and other\ncoast cities. The route to the coast was well known to my employer, and\ndetailing twelve men for the herd, a horse wrangler and cook extra, we\nstarted for it, barely touching at the ranch on our course. It was a\nnice ten days’ trip. After the first night, we used three guards of\nfour men each. Grazing contentedly, the cattle quieted down until on\nour arrival half our numbers could have handled them. The herd was\ncounted and received on the outlying prairies, and as no steamer was\ndue for a few days, another outfit took charge of them.\n\nUncle Lance was never much of a man for towns, and soon after\nsettlement the next morning we were ready to start home. But the\npayment, amounting to thirty thousand dollars, presented a problem, as\nthe bulk of it came to us in silver. There was scarcely a merchant in\nthe place who would assume the responsibility of receiving it even on\ndeposit, and in the absence of a bank, there was no alternative but to\ntake it home. The agent for the steamship company solicited the money\nfor transportation to New Orleans, mentioning the danger of robbery,\nand referring to the recent attempt of bandits to hold up the San\nAntonio and Corpus Christi stage. I had good cause to remember that\nincident, and was wondering what my employer would do under the\ncircumstances, when he turned from the agent, saying:—\n\n“Well, we’ll take it home just the same. I have no use for money in New\nOrleans. Nor do I care if every bandit in Texas knows we’ve got the\nmoney in the wagon. I want to buy a few new guns, anyhow. If robbers\ntackle us, we’ll promise them a warm reception—and I never knew a thief\nwho didn’t think more of his own carcass than of another man’s money.”\n\nThe silver was loaded into the wagon in sacks, and we started on our\nreturn. It was rather a risky trip, but we never concealed the fact\nthat we had every dollar of the money in the wagon. It would have been\ndangerous to make an attempt on us, for we were all well armed. We\nreached the ranch in safety, rested a day, and then took the ambulance\nand went on to San Antonio. Three of us, besides Tiburcio, accompanied\nour employer, each taking a saddle horse, and stopping by night at\nranches where we were known. On the third day we reached the city in\ngood time to bank the money, much to my relief.\n\nAs there was no work pressing at home, we spent a week in the city,\nthoroughly enjoying ourselves. Uncle Lance was negotiating for the\npurchase of a large Spanish land grant, which adjoined our range on the\nwest, taking in the Ganso and several miles’ frontage on both sides of\nthe home river. This required his attention for a few days, during\nwhich time Deweese met two men on the lookout for stock cattle with\nwhich to start a new ranch on the Devil’s River in Valverde County.\nThey were in the market for three thousand cows, to be delivered that\nfall or the following spring. Our _segundo_ promptly invited them to\nmeet his employer that evening at our hotel. As the ranges in eastern\nTexas became of value for agriculture, the cowman moved westward,\ndisposing of his cattle or taking them with him. It was men of this\nclass whom Deweese had met during the day, and on filling their\nappointment in the evening, our employer and the buyers soon came to an\nagreement. References were exchanged, and the next afternoon a contract\nwas entered into whereby we were to deliver, May first, at Las Palomas\nranch, three thousand cows between the ages of two and four years.\n\nThere was some delay in perfecting the title to the land grant. “We’ll\nstart home in the morning, boys,” said Uncle Lance, the evening after\nthe contract was drawn. “You simply can’t hurry a land deal. I’ll get\nthat tract in time, but there’s over a hundred heirs now of the\noriginal Don. I’d just like to know what the grandee did for his king\nto get that grant. Tickled his royal nibs, I reckon, with some cock and\nbull story, and here I have to give up nearly forty thousand dollars of\ngood honest money. Twenty years ago I was offered this same grant for\nten cents an acre, and now I’m paying four bits. But I didn’t have the\nmoney then, and I’m not sure I’d have bought it if I had. But I need it\nnow, and I need it bad, and that’s why I’m letting them hold me up for\nsuch a figure.”\n\nStopping at the “last chance” road house on the outskirts of the city\nthe next morning, for a final drink as we were leaving, Uncle Lance\nsaid to us over the cattle contract: “There’s money in it—good money,\ntoo. But we’re not going to fill it out of our home brand. Not in this\nyear of our Lord. I think too much of my cows to part with a single\nanimal. Boys, cows made Las Palomas what she is, and as long as they\nwin for me, I intend—to swear by them through thick and thin, in good\nand bad repute, fair weather or foul. So, June, just as soon as the\nfall branding is over, you can take Tom with you for an interpreter and\nstart for Mexico to contract these cows. Las Palomas is going to branch\nout and spread herself. As a ranchman, I can bring the cows across for\nbreeding purposes free of duty, and I know of no good reason why I\ncan’t change my mind and sell them. Dan, take Tiburcio out a cigar.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\nA TURKEY BAKE\n\n\nDeweese and I came back from Mexico during Christmas week. On reaching\nLas Palomas, we found Frank Nancrede and Add Tully, the latter being\nalso a trail foreman, at the ranch. They were wintering in San Antonio,\nand were spending a few weeks at our ranch, incidentally on the lookout\nfor several hundred saddle horses for trail purposes the coming spring.\nWe had no horses for sale, but nevertheless Uncle Lance had prevailed\non them to make Las Palomas headquarters during their stay in the\ncountry.\n\nThe first night at the ranch, Miss Jean and I talked until nearly\nmidnight. There had been so many happenings during my absence that it\nrequired a whole evening to tell them all. From the naming of Anita’s\nbaby to the rivalry between John and Theodore for the favor of Frances\nVaux, all the latest social news of the countryside was discussed. Miss\nJean had attended the dance at Shepherd’s during the fall, and had\nheard it whispered that Oxenford and Esther were anything but happy.\nThe latest word from the Vaux ranch said that the couple had separated;\nat least there was some trouble, for when Oxenford had attempted to\nforce her to return to Oakville, and had made some disparaging remarks,\nTony Hunter had crimped a six-shooter over his head. I pretended not to\nbe interested in this, but secretly had I learned that Hunter had\nkilled Oxenford, I should have had no very serious regrets.\n\nUncle Lance had promised Tully and Nancrede a turkey hunt during the\nholidays, so on our unexpected return it was decided to have it at\nonce. There had been a heavy mast that year, and in the encinal ridges\nto the east wild turkeys were reported plentiful. Accordingly we set\nout the next afternoon for a camp hunt in some oak cross timbers which\ngrew on the eastern border of our ranch lands. Taking two pack mules\nand Tiburcio as cook, a party of eight of us rode away, expecting to\nremain overnight. Uncle Lance knew of a fine camping spot about ten\nmiles from the ranch. When within a few miles of the place, Tiburcio\nwas sent on ahead with the pack mules to make camp. “Boys, we’ll divide\nup here,” said Uncle Lance, “and take a little scout through these\ncross timbers and try and locate some roosts. The camp will be in those\nnarrows ahead yonder where that burnt timber is to your right. Keep an\neye open for _javalina_ signs; they used to be plentiful through here\nwhen there was good mast. Now, scatter out in pairs, and if you can\nknock down a gobbler or two we’ll have a turkey bake to-night.”\n\nDan Happersett knew the camping spot, so I went with him, and together\nwe took a big circle through the encinal, keeping alert for game signs.\nBefore we had gone far, evidence became plentiful, not only of turkeys,\nbut of peccary and deer. Where the turkeys had recently been\nscratching, many times we dismounted and led our horses—but either the\nturkeys were too wary for us, or else we had been deceived as to the\nfreshness of the sign. Several successive shots on our right caused us\nto hurry out of the timber in the direction of the reports. Halting in\nthe edge of the timber, we watched the strip of prairie between us and\nthe next cover to the south. Soon a flock of fully a hundred wild\nturkeys came running out of the encinal on the opposite side and\nstarted across to our ridge. Keeping under cover, we rode to intercept\nthem, never losing sight of the covey. They were running fast; but when\nthey were nearly halfway across the opening, there was another shot and\nthey took flight, sailing into cover ahead of us, well out of range.\nBut one gobbler was so fat that he was unable to fly over a hundred\nyards and was still in the open. We rode to cut him off. On sighting\nus, he attempted to rise; but his pounds were against him, and when we\ncrossed his course he was so winded that our horses ran all around him.\nAfter we had both shot a few times, missing him, he squatted in some\ntall grass and stuck his head under a tuft. Dismounting, Dan sprang on\nto him like a fox, and he was ours. We wrung his neck, and agreed to\nreport that we had shot him through the head, thus concealing, in the\nabsence of bullet wounds, our poor marksmanship.\n\nWhen we reached the camp shortly before dark, we found the others had\nalready arrived, ours making the sixth turkey in the evening’s bag. We\nhad drawn ours on killing it, as had the others, and after supper Uncle\nLance superintended the stuffing of the two largest birds. While this\nwas in progress, others made a stiff mortar, and we coated each turkey\nwith about three inches of the waxy play, feathers and all. Opening our\ncamp-fire, we placed the turkeys together, covered them with ashes and\nbuilt a heaping fire over and around them. A number of haunts had been\nlocated by the others, but as we expected to make an early hunt in the\nmorning, we decided not to visit any of the roosts that night. After\nUncle Lance had regaled us with hunting stories of an early day, the\ndiscussion innocently turned to my recent elopement. By this time the\nscars had healed fairly well, and I took the chaffing in all good\nhumor. Tully told a personal experience, which, if it was the truth,\nargued that in time I might become as indifferent to my recent mishap\nas any one could wish.\n\n“My prospects of marrying a few years ago,” said Tully, lying full\nstretch before the fire, “were a whole lot better than yours, Quirk.\nBut my ambition those days was to boss a herd up the trail and get\ntop-notch wages. She was a Texas girl, just like yours, bred up in Van\nZandt County. She could ride a horse like an Indian. Bad horses seemed\nafraid of her. Why, I saw her once when she was about sixteen, take a\nblack stallion out of his stable,—lead him out with but a rope about\nhis neck,—throw a half hitch about his nose, and mount him as though he\nwas her pet. Bareback and without a bridle she rode him ten miles for a\ndoctor. There wasn’t a mile of the distance either but he felt the\nquirt burning in his flank and knew he was being ridden by a master.\nHer father scolded her at the time, and boasted about it later.\n\n“She had dozens of admirers, and the first impression I ever made on\nher was when she was about twenty. There was a big tournament being\ngiven, and all the young bloods in many counties came in to contest for\nthe prizes. I was a double winner in the games and contests—won a\nroping prize and was the only lad that came inside the time limit as a\nlancer, though several beat me on rings. Of course the tournament ended\nwith a ball. Having won the lance prize, it was my privilege of\ncrowning the ‘queen’ of the ball. Of course I wasn’t going to throw\naway such a chance, for there was no end of rivalry amongst the girls\nover it. The crown was made of flowers, or if there were none in\nseason, of live-oak leaves. Well, at the ball after the tournament I\ncrowned Miss Kate with a crown of oak leaves. After that I felt bold\nenough to crowd matters, and things came my way. We were to be married\nduring Easter week, but her mother up and died, so we put it off awhile\nfor the sake of appearances.\n\n“The next spring I got a chance to boss a herd up the trail for Jesse\nEllison. It was the chance of my life and I couldn’t think of refusing.\nThe girl put up quite a mouth about it, and I explained to her that a\nhundred a month wasn’t offered to every man. She finally gave in, but\nstill you could see she wasn’t pleased. Girls that way don’t sabe\ncattle matters a little bit. She promised to write me at several points\nwhich I told her the herd would pass. When I bade her good-by, tears\nstood in her eyes, though she tried to hide them. I’d have gambled my\nlife on her that morning.\n\n“Well, we had a nice trip, good outfit and strong cattle. Uncle Jess\nmounted us ten horses to the man, every one fourteen hands or better,\nfor we were contracted for delivery in Nebraska. It was a five months’\ndrive with scarcely an incident on the way. Just a run or two and a dry\ndrive or so. I had lots of time to think about Kate. When we reached\nthe Chisholm crossing on Red River, I felt certain that I would find a\nletter, but I didn’t. I wrote her from there, but when we reached\nCaldwell, nary a letter either. The same luck at Abilene. Try as I\nmight, I couldn’t make it out. Something was wrong, but what it was,\nwas anybody’s guess.\n\n“At this last place we got our orders to deliver the cattle at the\njunction of the middle and lower Loup. It was a terror of a long drive,\nbut that wasn’t a circumstance compared to not hearing from Kate. I\nkept all this to myself, mind you. When our herd reached its\ndestination, which it did on time, as hard luck would have it there was\na hitch in the payment. The herd was turned loose and all the outfit\nbut myself sent home. I stayed there two months longer at a little\nplace called Broken Bow. I held the bill of sale for the herd, and\nwould turn it over, transferring the cattle from one owner to another,\non the word from my employer. At last I received a letter from Uncle\nJesse saying that the payment in full had been made, so I surrendered\nthe final document and came home. Those trains seemed to run awful\nslow. But I got home all too soon, for she had then been married three\nmonths.\n\n“You see an agent for eight-day clocks came along, and being a stranger\ntook her eye. He was one of those nice, dapper fellows, wore a red\nnecktie, and could talk all day to a woman. He worked by the rule of\nthree,—tickle, talk, and flatter, with a few cutes thrown in for a\npelon; that gets nearly any of them. They live in town now. He’s a\nwindmill agent. I never went near them.”\n\nMeanwhile the fire kept pace with the talk, thanks to Uncle Lance’s\nwatchful eye. “That’s right, Tiburcio, carry up plenty of good lena,”\nhe kept saying. “Bring in all the black-jack oak that you can find; it\nmakes fine coals. These are both big gobblers, and to bake them until\nthey fall to pieces like a watermelon will require a steady fire till\nmorning. Pile up a lot of wood, and if I wake up during the night,\ntrust to me to look after the fire. I’ve baked so many turkeys this way\nthat I’m an expert at the business.”\n\n“A girl’s argument,” remarked Dan Happersett in a lull of talk, “don’t\nhave to be very weighty to fit any case. Anything she does is\njustifiable. That’s one reason why I always kept shy of women. I admit\nthat I’ve toyed around with some of them; have tossed my tug on one or\ntwo just to see if they would run on the rope. But now generally I keep\na wire fence between them and myself if they show any symptoms of being\non the marry. Maybe so I was in earnest once, back on the Trinity. But\nit seems that every time that I made a pass, my loop would foul or fail\nto open or there was brush in the way.”\n\n“Just because you have a few gray hairs in your head you think you’re\nawful foxy, don’t you?” said Uncle Lance to Dan. “I’ve seen lots of\nindependent fellows like you. If I had a little widow who knew her\ncards, and just let her kitten up to you and act coltish, inside a week\nyou would he following her around like a pet lamb.”\n\n“I knew a fellow,” said Nancrede, lighting his pipe with a firebrand,\n“that when the clerk asked him, when he went for a license to marry, if\nhe would swear that the young lady—his intended—was over twenty-one,\nsaid: ‘Yes, by G—, I’ll swear that she’s over thirty-one.’”\n\nAt the next pause in the yarning, I inquired why a wild turkey always\ndeceived itself by hiding its head and leaving the body exposed. “That\nit’s a fact, we all know,” volunteered Uncle Lance, “but the why and\nwherefore is too deep for me. I take it that it’s due to running to\nneck too much in their construction. Now an ostrich is the same way,\nall neck with not a lick of sense. And the same applies to the human\nfamily. You take one of these long-necked cowmen and what does he know\noutside of cattle. Nine times out of ten, I can tell a sensible girl by\nmerely looking at her neck. Now snicker, you dratted young fools, just\nas if I wasn’t talking horse sense to you. Some of you boys haven’t got\nmuch more sabe than a fat old gobbler.”\n\n“When I first came to this State,” said June Deweese, who had been\nquietly and attentively listening to the stories, “I stopped over on\nthe Neches River near a place called Shot-a-buck Crossing. I had an\nuncle living there with whom I made my home the first few years that I\nlived in Texas. There are more or less cattle there, but it is\nprincipally a cotton country. There was an old cuss living over there\non that river who was land poor, but had a powerful purty girl. Her old\nman owned any number of plantations on the river—generally had lots of\nnigger renters to look after. Miss Sallie, the daughter, was the belle\nof the neighborhood. She had all the graces with a fair mixture of the\nweaknesses of her sex. The trouble was, there was no young man in the\nwhole country fit to hold her horse. At least she and her folks\nentertained that idea. There was a storekeeper and a young doctor at\nthe county seat, who it seems took turns calling on her. It looked like\nit was going to be a close race. Outside of these two there wasn’t a\none of us who could touch her with a twenty-four-foot fish-pole. We\nsimply took the side of the road when she passed by.\n\n“About this time there drifted in from out west near Fort McKavett, a\nyoung fellow named Curly Thorn. He had relatives living in that\nneighborhood. Out at the fort he was a common foreman on a ranch. Talk\nabout your graceful riders, he sat a horse in a manner that left\nnothing to be desired. Well, Curly made himself very agreeable with all\nthe girls on the range, but played no special favorites. He stayed in\nthe country, visiting among cousins, until camp meeting began over at\nthe Alabama Camp Ground. During this meeting Curly proved himself quite\na gallant by carrying first one young lady and the next evening some\nother to camp meeting. During these two weeks of the meeting, some one\nintroduced him to Miss Sallie. Now, remember, he didn’t play her for a\nfavorite no more than any other. That’s what miffed her. She thought he\nought to.\n\n“One Sunday afternoon she intimated to him, like a girl sometimes will,\nthat she was going home, and was sorry that she had no companion for\nthe ride. This was sufficient for the gallant Curly to offer himself to\nher as an escort. She simply thought she was stealing a beau from some\nother girl, and he never dreamt he was dallying with Neches River\nroyalty. But the only inequality in that couple as they rode away from\nthe ground was an erroneous idea in her and her folks’ minds. And that\ndifference was in the fact that her old dad had more land than he could\npay taxes on. Well, Curly not only saw her home, but stayed for\ntea—that’s the name the girls have for supper over on the Neches—and\nthat night carried her back to the evening service. From that day till\nthe close of the session he was devotedly hers. A month afterward when\nhe left, it was the talk of the country that they were to be married\nduring the coming holidays.\n\n“But then there were the young doctor and the storekeeper still in the\ngame. Curly was off the scene temporarily, but the other two were\nriding their best horses to a shadow. Miss Sallie’s folks were pulling\nlike bay steers for the merchant, who had some money, while the young\ndoctor had nothing but empty pill bags and a saddle horse or two. The\ndoctor was the better looking, and, before meeting Curly Thorn, Miss\nSallie had favored him. Knowing ones said they were engaged. But near\nthe close of the race there was sufficient home influence used for the\nstorekeeper to take the lead and hold it until the show down came. Her\nfolks announced the wedding, and the merchant received the best wishes\nof his friends, while the young doctor took a trip for his health.\nWell, it developed afterwards that she was engaged to both the\nstorekeeper and the doctor at the same time. But that’s nothing. My\nexperience tells me that a girl don’t need broad shoulders to carry\nthree or four engagements at the same time.\n\n“Well, within a week of the wedding, who should drift in to spend\nChristmas but Curly Thorn. His cousins, of course, lost no time in\ngiving him the lay of the land. But Curly acted indifferent, and never\neven offered to call on Miss Sallie. Us fellows joked him about his\ngirl going to marry another fellow, and he didn’t seem a little bit put\nout. In fact, he seemed to enjoy the sudden turn as a good joke on\nhimself. But one morning, two days before the wedding was to take\nplace, Miss Sallie was missing from her home, as was likewise Curly\nThorn from the neighborhood. Yes, Thorn had eloped with her and they\nwere married the next morning in Nacogdoches. And the funny thing about\nit was, Curly never met her after his return until the night they\neloped. But he had a girl cousin who had a finger in the pie. She and\nMiss Sallie were as thick as three in a bed, and Curly didn’t have\nanything to do but play the hand that was dealt him.\n\n“Before I came to Las Palomas, I was over round Fort McKavett and met\nCurly. We knew each other, and he took me home and had me stay\novernight with him. They had been married then four years. She had a\nbaby on each knee and another in her arms. There was so much reality in\nlife that she had no time to become a dreamer. Matrimony in that case\nwas a good leveler of imaginary rank. I always admired Curly for the\nindifferent hand he played all through the various stages of the\ncourtship. He never knew there was such a thing as difference. He\nsimply coppered the play to win, and the cards came his way.”\n\n“Bully for Curly!” said Uncle Lance, arising and fixing the fire, as\nthe rest of us unrolled our blankets. “If some of my rascals could make\na ten strike like that it would break a streak of bad luck which has\novershadowed Las Palomas for over thirty years. Great Scott!—but those\ngobblers smell good. I can hear them blubbering and sizzling in their\nshells. It will surely take an axe to crack that clay in the morning.\nBut get under your blankets, lads, for I’ll call you for a turkey\nbreakfast about dawn.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\nSUMMER OF ’77\n\n\nDuring our trip into Mexico the fall before, Deweese contracted for\nthree thousand cows at two haciendas on the Rio San Juan. Early in the\nspring June and I returned to receive the cattle. The ranch outfit\nunder Uncle Lance was to follow some three weeks later and camp on the\nAmerican side at Roma, Texas. We made arrangements as we crossed into\nMexico with a mercantile house in Mier to act as our bankers,\ndepositing our own drafts and taking letters of credit to the interior.\nIn buying the cows we had designated Mier, which was just opposite\nRoma, as the place for settlement and Uncle Lance on his arrival\nbrought drafts to cover our purchases, depositing them with the same\nmerchant. On receiving, we used a tally mark which served as a road\nbrand, thus preventing a second branding, and throughout—much to the\ndisgust of the Mexican vaqueros—Deweese enforced every humane idea\nwhich Nancrede had practiced the spring before in accepting the trail\nherd at Las Palomas. There were endless quantities of stock cattle to\nselect from on the two haciendas, and when ready to start, under the\nspecifications, a finer lot of cows would have been hard to find. The\nworst drawback was that they were constantly dropping calves on the\nroad, and before we reached the river we had a calf-wagon in regular\nuse. On arriving at the Rio Grande, the then stage of water was\nfortunately low and we crossed the herd without a halt, the import\npapers having been attended to in advance.\n\nUncle Lance believed in plenty of help, and had brought down from Las\nPalomas an ample outfit of men and horses. He had also anticipated the\ndropping of calves and had rigged up a carrier, the box of which was\nopen framework. Thus until a calf was strong enough to follow, the\nmother, as she trailed along beside the wagon, could keep an eye on her\noffspring. We made good drives the first two or three days; but after\nclearing the first bottoms of the Rio Grande and on reaching the\ntablelands, we made easy stages of ten to twelve miles a day. When near\nenough to calculate on our arrival at Las Palomas, the old ranchero\nquit us and went on into the ranch. Several days later a vaquero met\nthe herd about thirty miles south of Santa Maria, and brought the\ninformation that the Valverde outfit was at the ranch, and instructions\nto veer westward and drive down the Ganso on approaching the Nueces. By\nthese orders the delivery on the home river would occur at least twenty\nmiles west of the ranch headquarters.\n\nAs we were passing to the westward of Santa Maria, our employer and one\nof the buyers rode out from that ranch and met the herd. They had\ndecided not to brand until arriving at their destination on the Devil’s\nRiver, which would take them at least a month longer. While this\ndeviation was nothing to us, it was a gain to them. The purchaser was\ndelighted with the cattle and our handling of them, there being fully a\nthousand young calves, and on reaching their camp on the Ganso, the\ndelivery was completed—four days in advance of the specified time. For\nfear of losses, we had received a few head extra, and, on counting them\nover, found we had not lost a single hoof. The buyers received the\nextra cattle, and the delivery was satisfactorily concluded. One of the\npartners returned with us to Las Palomas for the final settlement,\nwhile the other, taking charge of the herd, turned them up the Nueces.\nThe receiving outfit had fourteen men and some hundred and odd horses.\nAside from their commissary, they also had a calf-wagon, drawn by two\nyoke of oxen and driven by a strapping big negro. In view of the big\ncalf crop, the partners concluded that an extra conveyance would not be\namiss, and on Uncle Lance making them a reasonable figure on our\ncalf-wagon and the four mules drawing it, they never changed a word but\ntook the outfit. As it was late in the day when the delivery was made,\nthe double outfit remained in the same camp that night, and with the\nbest wishes, bade each other farewell in the morning. Nearly a month\nhad passed since Deweese and I had left Las Palomas for the Rio San\nJuan, and, returning with the herd, had met our own outfit at the Rio\nGrande. During the interim, before the ranch outfit had started, the\nlong-talked-of tournament on the Nueces had finally been arranged. The\ndate had been set for the fifth of June, and of all the home news which\nthe outfit brought down to the Rio Grande, none was as welcome as this.\nAccording to the programme, the contests were to include riding,\nroping, relay races, and handling the lance. Several of us had never\nwitnessed a tournament; but as far as roping and riding were concerned,\nwe all considered ourselves past masters of the arts. The relay races\nwere simple enough, and Dan Happersett volunteered this explanation of\na lance contest to those of us who were uninitiated:—\n\n“Well,” said Dan, while we were riding home from the Ganso, “a straight\ntrack is laid off about two hundred yards long. About every forty yards\nthere is a post set up along the line with an arm reaching out over the\ntrack. From this there is suspended an iron ring about two inches in\ndiameter. The contestant is armed with a wooden lance of regulation\nlength, and as he rides down this track at full speed and within a time\nlimit, he is to impale as many of these rings as possible. Each\ncontestant is entitled to three trials and the one impaling the most\nrings is declared the victor. That’s about all there is to it, except\nthe award. The festivities, of course, close with a dance, in which the\nwinner crowns the Queen of the ball. That’s the reason the girls always\ntake such an interest in the lancing, because the winner has the\nchoosing of his Queen. I won it once, over on the Trinity, and chose a\nlittle cripple girl. Had to do it or leave the country, for it was\nlooked upon as an engagement to marry. Oh, I tell you, if a girl is\nsweet on a fellow, it’s a mighty strong card to play.”\n\nBefore starting for the Rio Grande, the old ranchero had worked our\nhorse stock, forming fourteen new _manadas_, so that on our return\nabout the only work which could command our attention was the breaking\nof more saddle horses. We had gentled two hundred the spring before,\nand breaking a hundred and fifty now, together with the old _remudas_,\nwould give Las Palomas fully five hundred saddle horses. The ranch had\nthe geldings, the men had time, and there was no good excuse for not\ngentling more horses. So after a few days’ rest the oldest and heaviest\ngeldings were gathered and we then settled down to routine horse work.\nBut not even this exciting employment could keep the coming tournament\nfrom our minds. Within a week after returning to the ranch, we laid off\na lancing course, and during every spare hour the knights of Las\nPalomas might be seen galloping over the course, practicing. I tried\nusing the lance several times, only to find that it was not as easy as\nit looked, and I finally gave up the idea of lancing honors, and turned\nmy attention to the relay races.\n\nMiss Jean had been the only representative of our ranch at Shepherd’s\non San Jacinto Day. But she had had her eyes open on that occasion, and\non our return had a message for nearly every one of us. I was not\nexpecting any, still the mistress of Las Palomas had met my old\nsweetheart and her sister, Mrs. Hunter, at the ferry, and the three had\ntalked the matter over and mingled their tears in mutual sympathy. I\nmade a blustering talk which was to cover my real feelings and to show\nthat I had grown indifferent toward Esther, but that tactful woman had\nnot lived in vain, and read me aright.\n\n“Tom,” said she, “I was a young woman when you were a baby. There’s\nlots of things in which you might deceive me, but Esther McLeod is not\none of them. You loved her once, and you can’t tell me that in less\nthan a year you have forgotten her. I won’t say that men forget easier\nthan women, but you have never suffered one tenth the heartaches over\nEsther McLeod that she has over you. You can afford to be generous with\nher, Tom. True, she allowed an older sister to browbeat and bully her\ninto marrying another man, but she was an inexperienced girl then. If\nyou were honest, you would admit that Esther of her own accord would\nnever have married Jack Oxenford. Then why punish the innocent? Oh,\nTom, if you could only see her now! Sorrow and suffering have developed\nthe woman in her, and she is no longer the girl you knew and loved.”\n\nMiss Jean was hewing too close to the line for my comfort. Her\nobservations were so near the truth that they touched me in a\nvulnerable spot. Yet as I paced the room, I expressed myself\nemphatically as never wishing to meet Esther McLeod again. I really\nfelt that way. But I had not reckoned on the mistress of Las Palomas,\nnor considered that her strong sympathy for my former sweetheart had\nmoved her to more than ordinary endeavor.\n\nThe month of May passed. Uncle Lance spent several weeks at the Booth\nranch on the Frio. At the home ranch practice for the contests went\nforward with vigor. By the first of June we had sifted the candidates\ndown until we had determined on our best men for each entry. The old\nranchero and our _segundo_, together with Dan Happersett, made up a\ngood set of judges on our special fitness for the different contests,\nand we were finally picked in this order: Enrique Lopez was to rope;\nPasquale Arispe was to ride; to Theodore Quayle fell the chance of\nhandling the lance, while I, being young and nimble on my feet, was\ndecided on as the rider in the ten-mile relay race.\n\nIn this contest I was fortunate in having the pick of over three\nhundred and fifty saddle horses. They were the accumulation of years of\nthe best that Las Palomas bred, and it was almost bewildering to make\nthe final selection. But in this I had the benefit of the home judges,\nand when the latter differed on the speed of a horse, a trial usually\nsettled the point. June Deweese proved to be the best judge of the\nranch horses, yet Uncle Lance never yielded his opinion without a test\nof speed. When the horses were finally decided on, we staked off a\nhalf-mile circular track on the first bottom of the river, and every\nevening the horses were sent over the course. Under the conditions, a\ncontestant was entitled to use as many horses as he wished, but must\nchange mounts at least twenty times in riding the ten miles, and must\nfinish under a time limit of twenty-five minutes. Out of our abundance\nwe decided to use ten mounts, thus allotting each horse two dashes of a\nhalf mile with a rest between.\n\nThe horse-breaking ended a few days before the appointed time. Las\nPalomas stood on the tiptoe of expectancy over the coming tourney. Even\nMiss Jean rode—having a gentle saddle horse caught up for her use, and\ntaking daily rides about the ranch, to witness the practice, for she\nwas as deeply interested as any of us in the forthcoming contests. Born\nto the soil of Texas, she was a horsewoman of no ordinary ability, and\nrode like a veteran. On the appointed day, Las Palomas was abandoned;\neven the Mexican contingent joining in the exodus for Shepherd’s, and\nonly a few old servants remaining at the ranch. As usual, Miss Jean\nstarted by ambulance the afternoon before, taking along a horse for her\nown saddle. The white element and the vaqueros made an early start,\ndriving a _remuda_ of thirty loose horses, several of which were\noutlaws, and a bell mare. They were the picked horses of the\nranch—those which we expected to use in the contests, and a change of\nmounts for the entire outfit on reaching the martial field. We had\nherded the horses the night before, and the vaqueros were halfway to\nthe ferry when we overtook them. Uncle Lance was with us and in the\nheight of his glory, in one breath bragging on Enrique and Pasquale,\nand admonishing and cautioning Theodore and myself in the next.\n\nOn nearing Shepherd’s, Uncle Lance preceded us, to hunt up the\ncommittee and enter a man from Las Palomas for each of the contests.\nThe ground had been well chosen,—a large open bottom on the north side\nof the river and about a mile above the ferry. The lancing course was\nlaid off; temporary corrals had been built, to hold about thirty range\ncattle for the roping, and an equal number of outlaw horses for the\nriding contests; at the upper end of the valley a half-mile circular\nracecourse had been staked off. Throwing our outlaws into the corral,\nand leaving the _remuda_ in charge of two vaqueros, we galloped into\nShepherd’s with the gathering crowd. From all indications this would be\na red-letter day at the ferry, for the attendance drained a section of\ncountry fully a hundred miles in diameter. On the north from\nCampbellton on the Atascosa to San Patricio on the home river to the\nsouth, and from the Blanco on the east to well up the Frio and San\nMiguel on the west, horsemen were flocking by platoons. I did not know\none man in twenty, but Deweese greeted them all as if they were near\nneighbors. Later in the morning, conveyances began to arrive from\nOakville and near-by points, and the presence of women lent variety to\nthe scene.\n\nUnder the rules, all entries were to be made before ten o’clock. The\ncontests were due to begin half an hour later, and each contestant was\nexpected to be ready to compete in the order of his application. There\nwere eight entries in the relay race all told, mine being the seventh,\nwhich gave me a good opportunity to study the riding of those who\npreceded me. There were ten or twelve entries each in the roping and\nriding contests, while the knights of the lance numbered an even\nthirty. On account of the large number of entries the contests would\nrequire a full day, running the three classes simultaneously, allowing\na slight intermission for lunch. The selection of disinterested judges\nfor each class slightly delayed the commencement. After changing horses\non reaching the field, the contests with the lance opened with a lad\nfrom Ramirena, who galloped over the course and got but a single ring.\nFrom the lateness of our entries, none of us would be called until\nafternoon, and we wandered at will from one section of the field to\nanother. “Red” Earnest, from Waugh’s ranch on the Frio, was the first\nentry in the relay race. He had a good mount of eight Spanish horses\nwhich he rode bareback, making many of his changes in less than fifteen\nseconds apiece, and finishing full three minutes under the time limit.\nThe feat was cheered to the echo, I joining with the rest, and numerous\nfriendly bets were made that the time would not be lowered that day.\nTwo other riders rode before the noon recess, only one of whom came\nunder the time limit, and his time was a minute over Earnest’s record.\n\nMiss Jean had camped the ambulance in sight of the field, and kept open\nhouse to all comers. Suspecting that she would have Mrs. Hunter and\nEsther for lunch, if they were present, I avoided our party and took\ndinner with Mrs. Booth. Meanwhile Uncle Lance detailed Deweese and\nHappersett to handle my horses, allowing us five vaqueros, and\ndistributing the other men as assistants to our other three\ncontestants. The day was an ideal one for the contests, rather warm\nduring the morning, but tempered later by a fine afternoon breeze. It\nwas after four o’clock when I was called, with Waugh’s man still in the\nlead. Forming a small circle at the starting-point, each of our\nvaqueros led a pair of horses, in bridles only, around a\nring,—constantly having in hand eight of my mount of ten. As handlers,\nI had two good men in our _segundo_ and Dan Happersett. I crossed the\nline amid the usual shouting with a running start, determined, if\npossible, to lower the record of Red Earnest. In making the changes,\nall I asked was a good grip on the mane, and I found my seat as the\nhorse shot away. The horses had broken into an easy sweat before the\nrace began, and having stripped to the lowest possible ounce of\nclothing, I felt that I was getting out of them every fraction of speed\nthey possessed. The ninth horse in my mount, a roan, for some unknown\nreason sulked at starting, then bolted out on the prairie, but got away\nwith the loss of only about ten seconds, running the half mile like a\nscared wolf. Until it came the roan’s turn to go again, no untoward\nincident happened, friendly timekeepers posting me at every change of\nmounts. But when this bolter’s turn came again, he reared and plunged\naway stiff-legged, crossed the inward furrow, and before I could turn\nhim again to the track, cut inside the course for two stakes or\npossibly fifty yards. By this time I was beyond recall, but as I came\nround and passed the starting-point, the judges attempted to stop me,\nand I well knew my chances were over. Uncle Lance promptly waived all\nrights to the award, and I was allowed to finish the race, lowering\nEarnest’s time over twenty seconds. The eighth contestant, so I learned\nlater, barely came under the time limit.\n\nThe vaqueros took charge of the relay mounts, and, reinvesting myself\nin my discarded clothing, I mounted my horse to leave the field, when\nwho should gallop up and extend sympathy and congratulations but Miss\nJean and my old sweetheart. There was no avoiding them, and discourtesy\nto the mistress of Las Palomas being out of the question, I greeted\nEsther with an affected warmth and cordiality. As I released her hand I\ncould not help noticing how she had saddened into a serious woman,\nwhile the gentleness in her voice condemned me for my attitude toward\nher. But Miss Jean artfully gave us little time for embarrassment,\ninviting me to show them the unconcluded programme. From contest to\ncontest, we rode the field until the sun went down, and the trials\nended.\n\nIt was my first tournament and nothing escaped my notice. There were\nfully one hundred and fifty women and girls, and possibly double that\nnumber of men, old and young, every one mounted and galloping from one\npoint of the field to another. Blushing maidens and their swains\ndropped out of the throng, and from shady vantage points watched the\ncrowd surge back and forth across the field of action. We were sorry to\nmiss Enrique’s roping; for having snapped his saddle horn with the\nfirst cast, he recovered his rope, fastened it to the fork of his\nsaddletree, and tied his steer in fifty-four seconds, or within ten of\nthe winner’s record. When he apologized to Miss Jean for his bad luck,\nhat in hand and his eyes as big as saucers, one would have supposed he\nhad brought lasting disgrace on Las Palomas.\n\nWe were more fortunate in witnessing Pasquale’s riding. For this\ncontest outlaws and spoilt horses had been collected from every\nquarter. Riders drew their mounts by lot, and Pasquale drew a\ncinnamon-colored coyote from the ranch of “Uncle Nate” Wilson of\nRamirena. Uncle Nate was feeling in fine fettle, and when he learned\nthat his contribution to the outlaw horses had been drawn by a Las\nPalomas man, he hunted up the ranchero. “I’ll bet you a new five-dollar\nhat that that cinnamon horse throws your vaquero so high that the birds\nbuild nests in his crotch before he hits the ground.” Uncle Lance took\nthe bet, and disdainfully ran his eye up and down his old friend,\nfinally remarking, “Nate, you ought to keep perfectly sober on an\noccasion like this—you’re liable to lose all your money.”\n\nPasquale was a shallow-brained, clownish fellow, and after saddling up,\nas he led the coyote into the open to mount, he imitated a drunken\nvaquero. Tipsily admonishing the horse in Spanish to behave himself, he\nvaulted into the saddle and clouted his mount over the head with his\nhat. The coyote resorted to every ruse known to a bucking horse to\nunseat his rider, in the midst of which Pasquale, languidly lolling in\nhis saddle, took a small bottle from his pocket, and, drinking its\ncontents, tossed it backward over his head. “Look at that, Nate,” said\nUncle Lance, slapping Mr. Wilson with his hat; “that’s one of the Las\nPalomas vaqueros, bred with just sense enough to ride anything that\nwears hair. We’ll look at those new hats this evening.”\n\nIn the fancy riding which followed, Pasquale did a number of stunts. He\npicked up hat and handkerchief from the ground at full speed, and\nlikewise gathered up silver dollars from alternate sides of his horse\nas the animal sped over a short course. Stripping off his saddle and\nbridle, he rode the naked horse with the grace of an Indian, and but\nfor his clownish indifference and the apparent ease with which he did\nthings, the judges might have taken his work more seriously. As it was,\nour outfit and those friendly to our ranch were proud of his\nperformance, but among outsiders, and even the judges, it was generally\nbelieved that he was tipsy, which was an injustice to him.\n\nOn the conclusion of the contest with the lance, among the thirty\nparticipants, four were tied on honors, one of whom was Theodore\nQuayle. The other contests being over, the crowd gathered round the\nlancing course, excitement being at its highest pitch. A lad from the\nBlanco was the first called for on the finals, and after three efforts\nfailed to make good his former trial. Quayle was the next called, and\nas he sped down the course my heart stood still for a moment; but as he\nreturned, holding high his lance, five rings were impaled upon it. He\nwas entitled to two more trials, but rested on his record until it was\ntied or beaten, and the next man was called. Forcing her way through\nthe crowded field, Miss Jean warmly congratulated Theodore, leaving\nEsther to my tender care. But at this juncture, my old sweetheart\ncaught sight of Frances Vaux and some gallant approaching from the\nriver’s shade, and together we galloped out to meet them. Miss Vaux’s\nescort was a neighbor lad from the Frio, but both he and I for the time\nbeing were relegated to oblivion, in the prospects of a Las Palomas man\nby the name of Quayle winning the lancing contest. Miss Frances, with a\nshrug, was for denying all interest in the result, but Esther and I\ndoubled on her, forcing her to admit “that it would be real nice if\nTeddy should win.” I never was so aggravated over the indifference of a\ngirl in my life, and my regard for my former sweetheart, on account of\nher enthusiasm for a Las Palomas lad, kindled anew within me.\n\n\n[Illustration: HE SPED DOWN THE COURSE]\n\n\nBut as the third man sped over the course, we hastily returned to watch\nthe final results. After a last trial the man threw down his lance,\nand, riding up, congratulated Quayle. The last contestant was a\nred-headed fellow from the Atascosa above Oakville, and seemed to have\na host of friends. On his first trial over the course, he stripped four\nrings, but on neither subsequent effort did he equal his first attempt.\nImitating the former contestant, the red-headed fellow broke his lance\nand congratulated the winner.\n\nThe tourney was over. Esther and I urged Miss Frances to ride over with\nus and congratulate Quayle. She demurred; but as the crowd scattered I\ncaught Theodore’s eye and, signaling to him, he rode out of the crowd\nand joined us. The compliments of Miss Vaux to the winner were insipid\nand lifeless, while Esther, as if to atone for her friend’s lack of\ninterest, beamed with happiness over Quayle’s good luck. Poor Teddy\nhardly knew which way to turn, and, nice girl as she was, I almost\nhated Miss Frances for her indifferent attitude. A plain, blunt fellow\nthough he was, Quayle had noticed the coolness in the greeting of the\nyoung lady whom he no doubt had had in mind for months, in case he\nshould win the privilege, to crown as Queen of the ball. Piqued and\nunsettled in his mind, he excused himself on some trivial pretense and\nwithdrew. Every one was scattering to the picnic grounds for supper,\nand under the pretense of escorting Esther to the Vaux conveyance, I\naccompanied the young ladies. Managing to fall to the rear of Miss\nFrances and her gallant for the day, I bluntly asked my old sweetheart\nif she understood the attitude of her friend. For reply she gave me a\npitying glance, saying, “Oh, you boys know so little about a girl! You\nsee that Teddy chooses Frances for his Queen to-night, and leave the\nrest to me.”\n\nOn reaching their picnic camp, I excused myself, promising to meet them\nlater at the dance, and rode for our ambulance. Tiburcio had supper all\nready, and after it was over I called Theodore to one side and repeated\nEsther’s message. Quayle was still doubtful, and I called Miss Jean to\nmy assistance, hoping to convince him that Miss Vaux was not unfriendly\ntowards him. “You always want to judge a woman by contraries,” said\nMiss Jean, seating herself on the log beside us. “When it comes to\nacting her part, always depend on a girl to conceal her true feelings,\nespecially if she has tact. Now, from what you boys say, my judgment is\nthat she’d cry her eyes out if any other girl was chosen Queen.”\n\nUncle Lance had promised Mr. Wilson to take supper with his family, and\nas we were all sprucing up for the dance, he returned. He had not been\npresent at the finals of the lancing contest, but from guests of the\nWilsons’ had learned that one of his boys had won the honors. So on\nriding into camp, as the finishing touches were being added to our\nrustic toilets, he accosted Quayle and said: “Well, Theo, they tell me\nthat you won the elephant. Great Scott, boy, that’s the best luck that\nhas struck Las Palomas since the big rain a year ago this month! Of\ncourse, we all understand that you’re to choose the oldest Vaux girl.\nWhat’s that? You don’t know? Well, I do. I’ve had that all planned out,\nin case you won, ever since we decided that you was to contest as the\nrepresentative of Las Palomas. And now you want to balk, do you?”\n\nUncle Lance was showing some spirit, but his sister checked him with\nthis explanation: “Just because Miss Frances didn’t show any enthusiasm\nover Theo winning, he and Tom somehow have got the idea in their minds\nthat she don’t care a rap to be chosen Queen. I’ve tried to explain it\nto them, but the boys don’t understand girls, that’s all. Why, if Theo\nwas to choose any other girl, she’d set the river afire.”\n\n“That’s it, is it?” snorted Uncle Lance, pulling his gray mustaches.\n“Well, I’ve known for some time that Tom didn’t have good sense, but I\nhave always given you, Theo, credit for having a little. I’ll gamble my\nall that what Jean says is Bible truth. Didn’t I have my eye on you and\nthat girl for nearly a week during the hunt a year ago, and haven’t you\nbeen riding my horses over to the Frio once or twice a month ever\nsince? You can read a brand as far as I can, but I can see that you’re\nas blind as a bat about a girl. Now, young fellow, listen to me: when\nthe master of ceremonies announces the winners of the day, and your\nname is called, throw out your brisket, stand straight on those\nbow-legs of yours, step forward and claim your privilege. When the\nwreath is tendered you, accept it, carry it to the lady of your choice,\nand kneeling before her, if she bids you arise, place the crown on her\nbrow and lead the grand march. I’d gladly give Las Palomas and every\nhoof on it for your years and chance.”\n\nThe festivities began with falling darkness. The master of ceremonies,\na school teacher from Oakville, read out the successful contestants and\nthe prizes to which they were entitled. The name of Theodore Quayle was\nthe last to be called, and excusing himself to Miss Jean, who had him\nin tow, he walked forward with a military air, executing every movement\nin the ceremony like an actor. As the music struck up, he and the\nblushing Frances Vaux, rare in rustic beauty and crowned with a wreath\nof live-oak leaves, led the opening march. Hundreds of hands clapped in\napproval, and as the applause quieted down, I turned to look for a\npartner, only to meet Miss Jean and my former sweetheart. Both were in\na seventh heaven of delight, and promptly took occasion to remind me of\nmy lack of foresight, repeating in chorus, “Didn’t I tell you?” But the\nmusic had broken into a waltz, which precluded any argument, and on the\nmistress remarking “You young folks are missing a fine dance,”\ninvoluntarily my arm encircled my old sweetheart, and we drifted away\ninto elysian fields.\n\nThe night after the first tournament at Shepherd’s on the Nueces in\nJune, ’77, lingers as a pleasant memory. Veiled in hazy retrospect,\nattempting to recall it is like inviting the return of childish dreams\nwhen one has reached the years of maturity. If I danced that night with\nany other girl than poor Esther McLeod, the fact has certainly escaped\nme. But somewhere in the archives of memory there is an indelible\npicture of a stroll through dimly lighted picnic grounds; of sitting on\na rustic settee, built round the base of a patriarchal live-oak, and\nlistening to a broken-hearted woman lay bare the sorrows which less\nthan a year had brought her. I distinctly recall that my eyes, though\nunused to weeping, filled with tears, when Esther in words of deepest\nsorrow and contrition begged me to forgive her heedless and reckless\nact. Could I harbor resentment in the face of such entreaty? The\nimpulsiveness of youth refused to believe that true happiness had gone\nout of her life. She was again to me as she had been before her\nunfortunate marriage, and must be released from the hateful bonds that\nbound her. Firm in this resolve, dawn stole upon us, still sitting at\nthe root of the old oak, oblivious and happy in each other’s presence,\nhaving pledged anew our troth for time and eternity.\n\nWith the breaking of day the revelers dispersed. Quite a large\ncontingent from those present rode several miles up the river with our\nparty. The _remuda_ had been sent home the evening before with the\nreturning vaqueros, while the impatience of the ambulance mules\nfrequently carried them in advance of the cavalcade. The mistress of\nLas Palomas had as her guest returning, Miss Jule Wilson, and the first\ntime they passed us, some four or five miles above the ferry, I noticed\nUncle Lance ride up, swaggering in his saddle, and poke Glenn Gallup in\nthe ribs, with a wink and nod towards the conveyance as the mules\ndashed past. The pace we were traveling would carry us home by the\nmiddle of the forenoon, and once we were reduced to the home crowd, the\nold matchmaker broke out enthusiastically:—\n\n“This tourney was what I call a success. I don’t care a tinker’s darn\nfor the prizes, but the way you boys built up to the girls last night\nwarmed the sluggish blood in my old veins. Even if Cotton did claim a\ndance or two with the oldest Vaux girl, if Theo and her don’t make the\nriffle now—well, they simply can’t help it, having gone so far. And did\nany of you notice Scales and old June and Dan cutting the pigeon wing\nlike colts? I reckon Quirk will have to make some new resolutions this\nmorning. Oh, I heard about your declaring that you never wanted to see\nEsther McLeod again. That’s all right, son, but hereafter remember that\na resolve about a woman is only good for the day it is made, or until\nyou meet her. And notice, will you, ahead yonder, that sister of mine\nplaying second fiddle as a matchmaker. Glenn, if I was you, the next\ntime Miss Jule looks back this way, I’d play sick, and maybe they’d let\nyou ride in the ambulance. I can see at a glance that she’s being\npoorly entertained.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\nHIDE HUNTING\n\n\nDuring the month of June only two showers fell, which revived the grass\nbut added not a drop of water to our tank supply or to the river. When\nthe coast winds which followed set in, all hope for rain passed for\nanother year. During the residence of the old ranchero at Las Palomas,\nthe Nueces valley had suffered several severe drouths as disastrous in\ntheir effects as a pestilence. There were places in its miles of\nmeanderings across our range where the river was paved with the bones\nof cattle which had perished with thirst. Realizing that such disasters\nrepeat themselves, the ranch was set in order. That fall we branded the\ncalf crop with unusual care. In every possible quarter, we prepared for\nthe worst. A dozen wells were sunk over the tract and equipped with\nwindmills. There was sufficient water in the river and tanks during the\nsummer and fall, but by Christmas the range was eaten off until the\ncattle, ranging far, came in only every other day to slake their\nthirst.\n\nThe social gayeties of the countryside received a check from the\nthreatened drouth. At Las Palomas we observed only the usual Christmas\nfestivities. Miss Jean always made it a point to have something extra\nfor the holiday season, not only in her own household, but also among\nthe Mexican families at headquarters and the outlying ranchites. Among\na number of delicacies brought up this time from Shepherd’s was a box\nof Florida oranges, and in assisting Miss Jean to fill the baskets for\neach _jacal_, Aaron Scales opened this box of oranges and found a\nletter, evidently placed there by some mischievous girl in the packery\nfrom which the oranges were shipped. There was not only a letter but a\nvisiting card and a small photograph of the writer. This could only be\naccepted by the discoverer as a challenge, for the sender surely knew\nthis particular box was intended for shipment to Texas, and banteringly\ninvited the recipient to reply. The missive certainly fell upon fertile\nsoil, and Scales, by right of discovery, delegated to himself the\npleasure of answering.\n\nScales was the black sheep of Las Palomas. Born of a rich, aristocratic\nfamily in Maryland, he had early developed into a good-natured but\nreckless spendthrift, and his disreputable associates had contributed\nno small part in forcing him to the refuge of a cattle ranch. He had\nbeen offered every opportunity to secure a good education, but during\nhis last year in college had been expelled, and rather than face\nparental reproach had taken passage in a coast schooner for Galveston,\nTexas. Then by easy stages he drifted westward, and at last, to his\nliking, found a home at Las Palomas. He made himself a useful man on\nthe ranch, but, not having been bred to the occupation and with a\ntendency to waywardness, gave a rather free rein to the vagabond spirit\nwhich possessed him. He was a good rider, even for a country where\nevery one was a born horseman, but the use of the rope was an art he\nnever attempted to master.\n\nWith the conclusion of the holiday festivities and on the return of the\nabsentees, a feature, new to me in cattle life, presented itself—hide\nhunting. Freighters who brought merchandise from the coast towns to the\nmerchants of the interior were offering very liberal terms for return\ncargoes. About the only local product was flint hides, and of these\nthere were very few, but the merchant at Shepherd’s Ferry offered so\ngenerous inducements that Uncle Lance investigated the matter; the\nresult was his determination to rid his range of the old, logy,\nworthless bulls. Heretofore they had been allowed to die of old age,\nbut ten cents a pound for flint hides was an encouragement to remove\nthese cumberers of the range, and turn them to some profit. So we were\nordered to kill every bull on the ranch over seven years old.\n\nIn our round-up for branding, we had driven to the home range all\noutside cattle indiscriminately. They were still ranging near, so that\nat the commencement of this work nearly all the bulls in our brand were\nwatering from the Nueces. These old residenter bulls never ranged over\na mile away from water, and during the middle of the day they could be\nfound along the river bank. Many of them were ten to twelve years old,\nand were as useless on the range as drones in autumn to a colony of\nhoney-bees. Las Palomas boasted quite an arsenal of firearms, of every\nmake and pattern, from a musket to a repeater. The outfit was divided\ninto two squads, one going down nearly to Shepherd’s, and the other\nbeginning operations considerably above the Ganso. June Deweese took\nthe down-river end, while Uncle Lance took some ten of us with one\nwagon on the up-river trip. To me this had all the appearance of a\npicnic. But the work proved to be anything but a picnic. To make the\nkill was most difficult. Not willing to leave the carcasses near the\nriver, we usually sought the bulls coming in to water; but an ordinary\ncharge of powder and lead, even when well directed at the forehead,\nrarely killed and tended rather to aggravate the creature. Besides, as\nwe were compelled in nearly every instance to shoot from horseback, it\nwas almost impossible to deliver an effective shot from in front. After\none or more unsuccessful shots, the bull usually started for the\nnearest thicket, or the river; then our ropes came into use. The work\nwas very slow; for though we operated in pairs, the first week we did\nnot average a hide a day to the man; after killing, there was the\nanimal to skin, the hide to be dragged from a saddle pommel into a hide\nyard and pegged out to dry.\n\nUntil we had accumulated a load of hides, Tiburcio Leal, our teamster,\nfell to me as partner. We had with us an abundance of our best horses,\nand those who were reliable with the rope had first choice of the\n_remuda_. Tiburcio was well mounted, but, on account of his years, was\ntimid about using a rope; and well he might be, for frequently we found\nourselves in a humorous predicament, and sometimes in one so grave that\nhilarity was not even a remote possibility.\n\nThe second morning of the hunt, Tiburcio and I singled out a big black\nbull about a mile from the river. I had not yet been convinced that I\ncould not make an effective shot from in front, and, dismounting,\nattracted the bull’s attention and fired. The shot did not even stagger\nhim and he charged us; our horses avoided his rush, and he started for\nthe river. Sheathing my carbine, I took down my rope and caught him\nbefore he had gone a hundred yards. As I threw my horse on his haunches\nto receive the shock, the weight and momentum of the bull dragged my\ndouble-cinched saddle over my horse’s head and sent me sprawling on the\nground. In wrapping the loose end of the rope around the pommel of the\nsaddle, I had given it a half hitch, and as I came to my feet my saddle\nand carbine were bumping merrily along after Toro. Regaining my horse,\nI soon overtook Tiburcio, who was attempting to turn the animal back\nfrom the river, and urged him to “tie on,” but he hesitated, offering\nme his horse instead. As there was no time to waste, we changed horses\nlike relay riders. I soon overtook the animal and made a successful\ncast, catching the bull by the front feet. I threw Tiburcio’s horse,\nlike a wheeler, back on his haunches, and, on bringing the rope taut,\nfetched Toro to his knees; but with the strain the half-inch manila\nrope snapped at the pommel like a twine string. Then we were at our\nwit’s end, the bull lumbering away with the second rope noosed over one\nfore foot, and leaving my saddle far in the rear. But after a moment’s\nhesitation my partner and I doubled on him, to make trial of our guns,\nTiburcio having a favorite old musket while I had only my six-shooter.\nTiburcio, on my stripped horse, overtook the bull first, and attempted\nto turn him, but El Toro was not to be stopped. On coming up myself, I\ntried the same tactics, firing several shots into the ground in front\nof him but without deflecting the enraged bull from his course. Then I\nunloosed a Mexican blanket from Tiburcio’s saddle, and flaunting it in\nhis face, led him like a matador inviting a charge. This held his\nattention until Tiburcio, gaining courage, dashed past him from the\nrear and planted a musket ball behind the base of his ear, and the\npatriarch succumbed.\n\nAfter the first few days’ work, we found that the most vulnerable spot\nwas where the spinal cord connects with the base of the brain. A\nwell-directed shot at this point, even from a six-shooter, never failed\nto bring Toro to grass; and some of us became so expert that we could\ndeliver this favorite shot from a running horse. The trouble was to get\nthe bull to run evenly. That was one thing he objected to, and yet\nunless he did we could not advantageously attack him with a\nsix-shooter. Many of these old bulls were surly in disposition, and\neven when they did run, there was no telling what moment they would\nsulk, stop without an instant’s notice, and attempt to gore a passing\nhorse.\n\nWe usually camped two or three days at a place, taking in both sides of\nthe river, and after the work was once well under way we kept our wagon\nbusy hauling the dry hides to a common yard on the river opposite Las\nPalomas. Without apology, it can be admitted that we did not confine\nour killing to the Las Palomas brand alone, but all cumberers on our\nrange met the same fate. There were numerous stray bulls belonging to\ndistant ranches which had taken up their abode on the Nueces, all of\nwhich were fish to our net. We kept a brand tally of every bull thus\nkilled; for the primary motive was not one of profit, but to rid the\nrange of these drones.\n\nWhen we had been at work some two weeks, we had an exciting chase one\nafternoon in which Enrique Lopez figured as the hero. In coming in to\ndinner that day, Uncle Lance told of the chase after a young _ladino_\nbull with which we were all familiar. The old ranchero’s hatred to wild\ncattle had caused him that morning to risk a long shot at this outlaw,\nwounding him. Juan Leal and Enrique Lopez, who were there, had both\ntried their marksmanship and their ropes on him in vain. Dragging down\nhorses and snapping ropes, the bull made his escape into a chaparral\nthicket. He must have been exceedingly nimble; for I have seen Uncle\nLance kill a running deer at a hundred yards with a rifle. At any rate,\nthe entire squad turned out after dinner to renew the attack. We\nsaddled the best horses in our _remuda_ for the occasion, and sallied\nforth to the lair of the _ladino_ bull, like a procession of\nprofessional bull-fighters.\n\nThe chaparral thicket in which the outlaw had taken refuge lay about a\nmile and a half back from the river and contained about two acres. On\nreaching the edge of the thicket, Uncle Lance called for volunteers to\nbeat the brush and rout out the bull. As this must be done on foot,\nresponses were not numerous. But our employer relieved the\nembarrassment by assigning vaqueros to the duty, also directing Enrique\nto take one point of the thicket and me the other, with instructions to\nuse our ropes should the outlaw quit the thicket for the river.\nDetailing Tiburcio, who was with us that afternoon, to assist him in\nleading the loose saddle horses, he divided the six other men into two\nsquads under Theodore Quayle and Dan Happersett. When all was ready,\nEnrique and myself took up our positions, hiding in the outlying\nmesquite brush; leaving the loose horses under saddle in the cover at a\ndistance. The thicket was oval in form, lying with a point towards the\nriver, and we all felt confident if the bull were started he would make\nfor the timber on the river. With a whoop and hurrah and a free\ndischarge of firearms, the beaters entered the chaparral. From my\nposition I could see Enrique lying along the neck of his horse about\nfifty yards distant; and I had fully made up my mind to give that\nbucolic vaquero the first chance. During the past two weeks my\nenthusiasm for roping stray bulls had undergone a change; I was now\nquite willing that all honors of the afternoon should fall to Enrique.\nThe beaters approached without giving any warning that the bull had\nbeen sighted, and so great was the strain and tension that I could feel\nthe beating of my horse’s heart beneath me. The suspense was finally\nbroken by one or two shots in rapid succession, and as the sound died\naway, the voice of Juan Leal rang out distinctly: “Cuidado por el\ntoro!” and the next moment there was a cracking of brush and a pale dun\nbull broke cover.\n\nFor a moment he halted on the border of the thicket: then, as the din\nof the beaters increased, struck boldly across the prairie for the\nriver. Enrique and I were after him without loss of time. Enrique made\na successful cast for his horns, and reined in his horse; but when the\nslack of the rope was taken up the rear cinch broke, the saddle was\njerked forward on the horse’s withers, and Enrique was compelled to\nfree the rope or have his horse dragged down. I saw the mishap, and,\ngiving my horse the rowel, rode at the bull and threw my rope. The loop\nneatly encircled his front feet, and when the shock came between horse\nand bull, it fetched the toro a somersault in the air, but unhappily\ntook off the pommel of my saddle. The bull was on his feet in a jiffy,\nand before I could recover my rope, Enrique, who had reset his saddle,\npassed me, followed by the entire squad. Uncle Lance had been a witness\nto both mishaps, and on overtaking us urged me to tie on to the bull\nagain. For answer I could only point to my missing pommel; but every\nman in the squad had loosened his rope, and it looked as if they would\nall fasten on to the _ladino_, for they were all good ropers. Man after\nman threw his loop on him; but the dun outlaw snapped the ropes as if\nthey had been cotton strings, dragging down two horses with their\nriders and leaving them in the rear. I rode up alongside Enrique and\noffered him my rope, but he refused it, knowing it would be useless to\ntry again with only a single cinch on his saddle. The young rascal had\na daring idea in mind. We were within a quarter mile of the river, and\nescape of the outlaw seemed probable, when Enrique rode down on the\nbull, took up his tail, and, wrapping the brush on the pommel of his\nsaddle, turned his horse abruptly to the left, rolling the bull over\nlike a hoop, and of course dismounting himself in the act. Then before\nthe dazed animal could rise, with the agility of a panther the vaquero\nsprang astride his loins, and as he floundered, others leaped from\ntheir horses. Toro was pinioned, and dispatched with a shot.\n\nThen we loosened cinches to allow our heaving horses to breathe, and\nthrew ourselves on the ground for a moment’s rest. “That’s the best\nkill we’ll make on this trip,” said Uncle Lance as we mounted, leaving\ntwo vaqueros to take the hide. “I despise wild cattle, and I’ve been\nhungering to get a shot at that fellow for the last three years.\nEnrique, the day the baby is born, I’ll buy it a new cradle, and Tom\nshall have a new saddle and we’ll charge it to Las Palomas—she’s the\ngirl that pays the bills.”\n\nScarcely a day passed but similar experiences were related around the\ncamp-fire. In fact, as the end of the work came in view, they became\ncommonplace with us. Finally the two outfits were united at the general\nhide yard near the home ranch. Coils of small rope were brought from\nheadquarters, and a detail of men remained in camp, baling the flint\nhides, while the remainder scoured the immediate country. A crude press\nwas arranged, and by the aid of a long lever the hides were compressed\ninto convenient space for handling by the freighters.\n\nWhen we had nearly finished the killing and baling, an unlooked-for\nincident occurred. While Deweese was working down near Shepherd’s\nFerry, report of our work circulated around the country, and his camp\nhad been frequently visited by cattlemen. Having nothing to conceal, he\nhad showed his list of outside brands killed, which was perfectly\nsatisfactory in most instances. As was customary in selling cattle, we\nexpected to make report of every outside hide taken, and settle for\nthem, deducting the necessary expense. But in every community there are\nthose who oppose prevailing customs, and some who can always see\nsinister motives. One forenoon, when the baling was nearly finished, a\ndelegation of men, representing brands of the Frio and San Miguel, rode\nup to our hide yard. They were all well-known cowmen, and Uncle Lance,\nbeing present, saluted them in his usual hearty manner. In response to\nan inquiry—“what he thought he was doing”—Uncle Lance jocularly\nreplied:—\n\n“Well, you see, you fellows allow your old bulls to drift down on my\nrange, expecting Las Palomas to pension them the remainder of their\ndays. But that’s where you get fooled. Ten cents a pound for flint\nhides beats letting these old stagers die of old age. And this being an\nidle season with nothing much to do, we wanted to have a little fun.\nAnd we’ve had it. But laying all jokes aside, fellows, it’s a good idea\nto get rid of these old varmints. Hereafter, I’m going to make a\nkilling off every two or three years. The boys have kept a list of all\nstray brands killed, and you can look them over and see how many of\nyours we got. We have baled all the stray hides separate, so they can\nbe looked over. But it’s nearly noon, and you’d better all ride up to\nthe ranch for dinner—they feed better up there than we do in camp.”\n\nRather than make a three-mile ride to the house, the visitors took\ndinner with the wagon, and about one o’clock Deweese and a vaquero came\nin, dragging a hide between them. June cordially greeted the callers,\nincluding Henry Annear, who represented the Las Norias ranch, though I\nsuppose it was well known to every one present that there was no love\nlost between them. Uncle Lance asked our foreman for his list of\noutside brands, explaining that these men wished to look them over.\nEverything seemed perfectly satisfactory to all parties concerned, and\nafter remaining in camp over an hour, Deweese and the vaquero saddled\nfresh horses and rode away. The visitors seemed in no hurry to go, so\nUncle Lance sat around camp entertaining them, while the rest of us\nproceeded with our work of baling. Before leaving, however, the entire\nparty in company of our employer took a stroll about the hide yard,\nwhich was some distance from camp. During this tour of inspection,\nAnnear asked which were the bales of outside hides taken in Deweese’s\ndivision, claiming he represented a number of brands outside of Las\nNorias. The bales were pointed out and some dozen unbaled hides looked\nover. On a count the baled and unbaled hides were found to tally\nexactly with the list submitted. But unfortunately Annear took occasion\nto insinuate that the list of brands rendered had been “doctored.”\nUncle Lance paid little attention, though he heard, but the other\nvisitors remonstrated with Annear. This only seemed to make him more\ncontentious. Finally matters came to an open rupture when Annear\ndemanded that the cordage be cut on certain bales to allow him to\ninspect them. Possibly he was within his rights, but on the Nueces\nduring the seventies, to question a man’s word was equivalent to\ncalling him a liar; and _liar_ was a fighting word all over the cattle\nrange.\n\n“Well, Henry,” said Uncle Lance, rather firmly, “if you are not\nsatisfied, I suppose I’ll have to open the bales for you, but before I\ndo, I’m going to send after June. Neither you nor any one else can cast\nany reflections on a man in my employ. No unjust act can be charged in\nmy presence against an absent man. The vaqueros tell me that my foreman\nis only around the bend of the river, and I’m going to ask all you\ngentlemen to remain until I can send for him.”\n\nJohn Cotton was dispatched after Deweese. Conversation meanwhile became\npolite and changed to other subjects. Those of us at work baling hides\nwent ahead as if nothing unusual was on the tapis. The visitors were\nall armed, which was nothing unusual, for the wearing of six-shooters\nwas as common as the wearing of boots. During the interim, several\nlevel-headed visitors took Henry Annear to one side, evidently to\nreason with him and urge an apology, for they could readily see that\nUncle Lance was justly offended. But it seemed that Annear would listen\nto no one, and while they were yet conversing among themselves, John\nCotton and our foreman galloped around the bend of the river and rode\nup to the yard. No doubt Cotton had explained the situation, but as\nthey dismounted Uncle Lance stepped between his foreman and Annear,\nsaying:—\n\n“June, Henry, here, questions the honesty of your list of strays\nkilled, and insists on our cutting the bales for his inspection.”\nTurning to Annear, Uncle Lance inquired, “Do you still insist on\nopening the bales?”\n\n“Yes, sir, I do.”\n\nDeweese stepped to one side of his employer, saying to Annear: “You\noffer to cut a bale here to-day, and I’ll cut your heart out. Behind my\nback, you questioned my word. Question it to my face, you dirty sneak.”\n\nAnnear sprang backward and to one side, drawing a six-shooter in the\nmovement, while June was equally active. Like a flash, two shots rang\nout. Following the reports, Henry turned halfway round, while Deweese\nstaggered a step backward. Taking advantage of the instant, Uncle Lance\nsprang like a panther on to June and bore him to the ground, while the\nvisitors fell on Annear and disarmed him in a flash. They were dragged\nstruggling farther apart, and after some semblance of sanity had\nreturned, we stripped our foreman and found an ugly flesh wound\ncrossing his side under the armpit, the bullet having been deflected by\na rib. Annear had fared worse, and was spitting blood freely, and the\nmarks of exit and entrance of the bullet indicated that the point of\none lung had been slightly chipped.\n\n“I suppose this outcome is what you might call the _amende honorable_”\nsmilingly said George Nathan, one of the visitors, later to Uncle\nLance. “I always knew there was a little bad blood existing between the\nboys, but I had no idea that it would flash in the pan so suddenly or\nI’d have stayed at home. Shooting always lets me out. But the question\nnow is, How are we going to get our man home?”\n\nUncle Lance at once offered them horses and a wagon, in case Annear\nwould not go into Las Palomas. This he objected to, so a wagon was\nfitted up, and, promising to return it the next day, our visitors\ndeparted with the best of feelings, save between the two belligerents.\nWe sent June into the ranch and a man to Oakville after a surgeon, and\nresumed our work in the hide yard as if nothing had happened. Somewhere\nI have seen the statement that the climate of California was especially\nconducive to the healing of gunshot wounds. The same claim might be\nmade in behalf of the Nueces valley, for within a month both the\ncombatants were again in their saddles.\n\nWithin a week after this incident, we concluded our work and the hides\nwere ready for the freighters. We had spent over a month and had taken\nfully seven hundred hides, many of which, when dry, would weigh one\nhundred pounds, the total having a value of between five and six\nthousand dollars. Like their predecessors the buffalo, the remains of\nthe ladinos were left to enrich the soil; but there was no danger of\nthe extinction of the species, for at Las Palomas it was the custom to\nallow every tenth male calf to grow up a bull.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\nA TWO YEARS’ DROUTH\n\n\nThe spring of ’78 was an early one, but the drouth continued, and after\nthe hide hunting was over we rode our range almost night and day.\nThousands of cattle had drifted down from the Frio River country, which\nsection was suffering from drouth as badly as the Nueces. The new wells\nwere furnishing a limited supply of water, but we rigged pulleys on the\nbest of them, and when the wind failed we had recourse to buckets and a\nrope worked from the pommel of a saddle. A breeze usually arose about\nten in the morning and fell about midnight. During the lull the buckets\nrose and fell incessantly at eight wells, with no lack of suffering\ncattle in attendance to consume it as fast as it was hoisted. Many\nthirsty animals gorged themselves, and died in sight of the well; weak\nones being frequently trampled to death by the stronger, while flint\nhides were corded at every watering point. The river had quit flowing,\nand with the first warmth of spring the pools became rancid and\nstagnant. In sandy and subirrigated sections, under a March sun, the\ngrass made a sickly effort to spring; but it lacked substance, and so\nfar from furnishing food for the cattle, it only weakened them.\n\nThis was my first experience with a serious drouth. Uncle Lance,\nhowever, met the emergency as though it were part of the day’s work,\nriding continually with the rest of us. During the latter part of\nMarch, Aaron Scales, two vaqueros, and myself came in one night from\nthe Ganso and announced not over a month’s supply of water in that\ncreek. We also reported to our employer that during our two days’ ride,\nwe had skinned some ten cattle, four of which were in our own brand.\n\n“That’s not as bad as it might be,” said the old ranchero,\nphilosophically. “You see, boys, I’ve been through three drouths since\nI began ranching on this river. The second one, in ’51, was the worst;\ncattle skulls were as thick along the Nueces that year as sunflowers in\nAugust. In ’66 it was nearly as bad, there being more cattle; but it\ndidn’t hurt me very much, as mavericking had been good for some time\nbefore and for several years following, and I soon recovered my losses.\nThe first one lasted three years, and had there been as many cattle as\nthere are now, half of them would have died. The spring before the\nsecond drouth, I acted as _padrino_ for Tiburcio and his wife, who was\nat that time a mere slip of a girl living at the Mission. Before they\nhad time to get married, the dry spell set in and they put the wedding\noff until it should rain. I ridiculed the idea, but they were both\nsuperstitious and stuck it out. And honest, boys, there wasn’t enough\nrain fell in two years to wet your shirt. In my forty years on the\nNueces, I’ve seen hard times, but that drouth was the toughest of them\nall. Game and birds left the country, and the cattle were too poor to\neat. Whenever our provisions ran low, I sent Tiburcio to the coast with\na load of hides, using six yoke of oxen to handle a cargo of about a\nton. The oxen were so poor that they had to stand twice in one place to\nmake a shadow, and we wouldn’t take gold for our flint hides but\ninsisted on the staples of life. At one point on the road, Tiburcio had\nto give a quart of flour for watering his team both going and coming.\nThey say that when the Jews quit a country, it’s time for the gentiles\nto leave. But we old timers are just like a horse that chooses a new\nrange and will stay with it until he starves or dies with old age.”\n\nI could see nothing reassuring in the outlook. Near the wells and along\nthe river the stock had trampled out the grass until the ground was as\nbare as a city street. Miles distant from the water the old dry grass,\nwith only an occasional green blade, was the only grazing for the\ncattle. The black, waxy soil on the first bottom of the river, on which\nthe mesquite grass had flourished, was as bare now as a ploughed field,\nwhile the ground had cracked open in places to an incredible depth, so\nthat without exercising caution it was dangerous to ride across. This\nwas the condition of the range at the approach of April. Our horse\nstock, to be sure, fared better, ranging farther and not requiring\nanything like the amount of water needed by the cattle. It was nothing\nunusual to meet a Las Palomas _manada_ from ten to twelve miles from\nthe river, and coming in only every second or third night to quench\ntheir thirst. We were fortunate in having an abundance of saddle\nhorses, which, whether under saddle or not, were always given the\npreference in the matter of water. They were the motive power of the\nranch, and during this crisis, though worked hard, must be favored in\nevery possible manner.\n\nEarly that spring the old ranchero sent Deweese to Lagarto in an\nattempt to sell Captain Byler a herd of horse stock for the trail. The\nmission was a failure, though our _segundo_ offered to sell a thousand,\nin the straight Las Palomas brand, at seven dollars a head on a year’s\ncredit. Even this was no inducement to the trail drover, and on\nDeweese’s return my employer tried San Antonio and other points in\nTexas in the hope of finding a market. From several places favorable\nreplies were received, particularly from places north of the Colorado\nRiver; for the drouth was local and was chiefly confined to the\nsouthern portion of the state. There was enough encouragement in the\nletters to justify the old ranchero’s attempt to reduce the demand on\nthe ranch’s water supply, by sending a herd of horse stock north on\nsale. Under ordinary conditions, every ranchman preferred to sell his\nsurplus stock at the ranch, and Las Palomas was no exception, being\ngenerally congested with marketable animals. San Antonio was, however,\nbeginning to be a local horse and mule market of some moment, and\nbefore my advent several small selected bunches of mares, mules, and\nsaddle horses had been sent there, and had found a ready and profitable\nsale.\n\nBut this was an emergency year, and it was decided to send a herd of\nstock horses up the country. Accordingly, before April, we worked every\n_manada_ which we expected to keep, cutting out all the two-year-old\nfillies. To these were added every mongrel-colored band to the number\nof twenty odd, and when ready to start the herd numbered a few over\ntwelve hundred of all ages from yearlings up. A _remuda_ of fifty\nsaddle horses, broken in the spring of ’76, were allotted to our use,\nand our _segundo_, myself, and five Mexican vaqueros were detailed to\ndrive the herd. We were allowed two pack mules for our commissary,\nwhich was driven with the _remuda_. With instructions to sell and hurry\nhome, we left our horse camp on the river, and started on the morning\nof the last day of March.\n\nLive-stock commission firms in San Antonio were notified of our coming,\nand with six men to the herd and the seventh driving the _remuda_, we\nput twenty miles behind us the first day. With the exception of water\nfor saddle stock, which we hoisted from a well, there was no hope of\nwatering the herd before reaching Mr. Booth’s ranch on the Frio. He had\nbeen husbanding his water supply, and early the second evening we\nwatered the herd to its contentment from a single shaded pool. From the\nFrio we could not follow any road, but were compelled to direct our\ncourse wherever there was a prospect of water. By hobbling the bell\nmare of the _remuda_ at evening, and making two watches of the\nnight-herding, we easily systematized our work. Until we reached the\nSan Antonio River, about twenty miles below the city, not over two days\npassed without water for all the stock, though, on account of the\nvariations from our course, we were over a week in reaching San\nAntonio. Having moved the herd up near some old missions within five or\nsix miles of the city, with an abundance of water and some grass,\nDeweese went into town, visiting the commission firms and looking for a\nbuyer. Fortunately a firm, which was expecting our arrival, had a\nprospective purchaser from Fort Worth for about our number. Making a\ndate with the firm to show our horses the next morning, our _segundo_\nreturned to the herd, elated over the prospect of a sale.\n\nOn their arrival the next morning, we had the horses already watered\nand were grazing them along an abrupt slope between the first and\nsecond bottoms of the river. The salesman understood his business, and\ndrove the conveyance back and forth on the down hill side, below the\nherd, and the rise in the ground made our range stock look as big as\nAmerican horses. After looking at the animals for an hour, from a\nbuckboard, the prospective buyer insisted on looking at the _remuda_.\nBut as these were gentle, he gave them a more critical examination,\ninsisting on their being penned in a rope corral at our temporary camp,\nand had every horse that was then being ridden unsaddled to inspect\ntheir backs. The _remuda_ was young, gentle, and sound, many of them\nsubmitting to be caught without a rope. The buyer was pleased with\nthem, and when the price came up for discussion Deweese artfully set a\nhigh figure on the saddle stock, and, to make his bluff good, offered\nto reserve them and take them back to the ranch. But Tuttle would not\nconsider the herd without the _remuda_, and sparring between them\ncontinued until all three returned to town.\n\nIt was a day of expectancy to the vaqueros and myself. In examining the\nsaddle horses, the buyer acted like a cowman; but as regarding the\nrange stock, it was evident to me that his armor was vulnerable, and if\nhe got any the best of our _segundo_ he was welcome to it. Deweese\nreturned shortly after dark, coming directly to the herd where I and\ntwo vaqueros were on guard, to inform us that he had sold lock, stock,\nand barrel, including the two pack mules. I felt like shouting over the\ngood news, when June threw a damper on my enthusiasm by the news that\nhe had sold for delivery at Fort Worth.\n\n“You see,” said Deweese, by way of explanation, “the buyer is foreman\nof a cattle company out on the forks of the Brazos in Young County. He\ndon’t sabe range horses as well as he does cows, and when we had agreed\non the saddle stock, and there were only two bits between us on the\nherd, he offered me six bits a head all round, over and above his\noffer, if I would put them in Fort Worth, and I took him up so quick\nthat I nearly bit my tongue doing it. Captain Redman tells me that it’s\nonly about three hundred miles, and grass and water is reported good. I\nintended to take him up at his offer, anyhow, and seventy-five cents a\nhead extra will make the old man nearly a thousand dollars, which is\nworth picking up. We’ll put them there easy in three weeks, learn the\ntrail and see the country besides. Uncle Lance can’t have any kick\ncoming, for I offered them to Captain Byler for seven dollars, and here\nI’m getting ten six-bits—nearly four thousand dollars’ advance, and we\nwon’t be gone five weeks. Any money down? Well, I should remark! Five\nthousand deposited with Smith & Redman, and I was particular to have it\ninserted in the contract between us that every saddle horse, mare,\nmule, gelding, and filly was to be in the straight ‘horse hoof’ brand.\nThere is a possibility that when Tuttle sees them again at Fort Worth,\nthey won’t look as large as they did on that hillside this morning.”\n\nWe made an early start from San Antonio the next morning, passing to\nthe westward of the then straggling city. The vaqueros were disturbed\nover the journey, for Fort Worth was as foreign to them as a European\nseaport, but I jollied them into believing it was but a little\n_pasear_. Though I had never ridden on a train myself, I pictured to\nthem the luxuriant ease with which we would return, as well as the trip\nby stage to Oakville. I threw enough enthusiasm into my description of\nthe good time we were going to have, coupled with their confidence in\nDeweese, to convince them in spite of their forebodings. Our _segundo_\nhumored them in various ways, and after a week on the trail, water\ngetting plentiful, using two guards, we only herded until midnight,\nturning the herd loose from then until daybreak. It usually took us\nless than an hour to gather and count them in the morning, and\nencouraged by their contentment, a few days later, we loose-herded\nuntil darkness and then turned them free. From then on it was a picnic\nas far as work was concerned, and our saddle horses and herd improved\nevery day.\n\nAfter crossing the Colorado River, at every available chance en route\nwe mailed a letter to the buyer, notifying him of our progress as we\nswept northward. When within a day’s drive of the Brazos, we mailed our\nlast letter, giving notice that we would deliver within three days of\ndate. On reaching that river, we found it swimming for between thirty\nand forty yards; but by tying up the pack mules and cutting the herd\ninto four bunches, we swam the Brazos with less than an hour’s delay.\nOverhauling and transferring the packs to horses, throwing away\neverything but the barest necessities, we crossed the lightened\ncommissary, the freed mules swimming with the _remuda_. On the morning\nof the twentieth day out from San Antonio, our _segundo_ rode into the\nfort ahead of the herd. We followed at our regular gait, and near the\nmiddle of the forenoon were met by Deweese and Tuttle, who piloted us\nto a pasture west of the city, where an outfit was encamped to receive\nthe herd. They numbered fifteen men, and looked at our insignificant\ncrowd with contempt; but the count which followed showed we had not\nlost a hoof since we left the Nueces, although for the last ten nights\nthe stock had had the fullest freedom.\n\nThe receiving outfit looked the brands over carefully. The splendid\ngrass and water of the past two weeks had transformed the famishing\nherd of a month before, and they were received without a question.\nRounding in our _remuda_ for fresh mounts before starting to town, the\nvaqueros and I did some fancy roping in catching out the horses,\npartially from sheer lightness of heart because we were at our\njourney’s end, and partially to show this north Texas outfit that we\nwere like the proverbial singed cat—better than we looked. Two of\nTurtle’s men rode into town with us that evening to lead back our\nmounts, the outfit having come in purposely to receive the horse herd\nand drive it to their ranch in Young County. While riding in, they\nthawed nicely towards us, but kept me busy interpreting for them with\nour Mexicans. Tuttle and Deweese rode together in the lead, and on\nnearing town one of the strangers bantered Pasquale to sell him a nice\nmaguey rope which the vaquero carried. When I interpreted the other’s\nwish to him, Pasquale loosened the lasso and made a present of it to\nTuttle’s man. I had almost as good a rope of the same material, which I\npresented to the other lad with us, and the drinks we afterward\nconsumed over this slight testimony of the amicable relations existing\nbetween a northern and southern Texas outfit over the delivery and\nreceiving of a horse herd, showed no evidence of a drouth. The\nfollowing morning I made inquiry for Frank Nancrede and the drovers who\nhad driven a trail herd of cattle from Las Palomas two seasons before.\nThey were all well known about the fort, but were absent at the time,\nhaving put up two trail herds that spring in Uvalde County. Deweese did\nnot waste an hour more than was necessary in that town, and while\nwaiting for the banks to open, arranged for our transportation to San\nAntonio. We were all ready to start back before noon. Fort Worth was a\nfrontier town at the time, bustling and alert with live-stock\ninterests; but we were anxious to get home, and promptly boarded a\ntrain for the south. After entering the train, our _segundo_ gave each\nof the vaqueros and myself some spending money, the greater portion of\nwhich went to the “butcher” for fruits. He was an enterprising fellow\nand took a marked interest in our comfort and welfare. But on nearing\nSan Antonio after midnight, he attempted to sell us our choice of three\nbooks, between the leaves of one of which he had placed a five-dollar\nbill and in another a ten, and offered us our choice for two dollars,\nand June Deweese became suddenly interested. Coming over to where we\nwere sitting, he knocked the books on the floor, kicked them under a\nseat, and threatened to bend a gun over the butcher’s head unless he\nmade himself very scarce. Then reminding us that “there were tricks in\nall trades but ours,” he kept an eye over us until we reached the city.\n\nWe were delayed another day in San Antonio, settling with the\ncommission firm and banking the money. The next morning we took stage\nfor Oakville, where we arrived late at night. When a short distance out\nof San Antonio I inquired of our driver who would relieve him beyond\nPleasanton, and was gratified to hear that his name was not Jack\nMartin. Not that I had anything particular against Martin, but I had no\nlove for his wife, and had no desire to press the acquaintance any\nfurther with her or her husband. On reaching Oakville, we were within\nforty miles of Las Palomas. We had our saddles with us, and early the\nnext morning tried to hire horses; but as the stage company domineered\nthe village we were unable to hire saddle stock, and on appealing to\nthe only livery in town we were informed that Bethel & Oxenford had the\nfirst claim on their conveyances. Accordingly Deweese and I visited the\noffices of the stage company, where, to our surprise, we came face to\nface with Jack Oxenford. I do not think he knew us, though we both knew\nhim at a glance. Deweese made known his wants, but only asked for a\nconveyance as far as Shepherd’s. Yankeelike, Oxenford had to know who\nwe were, where we had been, and where we were going. Our _segundo_ gave\nhim rather a short answer, but finally admitted that we belonged at Las\nPalomas. Then the junior member of the mail contractors became\narrogant, claiming that the only conveyance capable of carrying our\nparty was being held for a sheriff with some witnesses. On second\nthought he offered to send us to the ferry by two lighter vehicles in\nconsideration of five dollars apiece, insolently remarking that we\ncould either pay it or walk. I will not repeat Deweese’s reply, which I\nsilently endorsed.\n\nWith the soil of the Nueces valley once more under our feet we felt\nindependent. On returning to the vaqueros, we found a stranger among\nthem, Bernabe Cruze by name, who was a _muy amigo_ of Santiago Ortez,\none of our Mexicans. He belonged at the Mission, and when he learned of\nour predicament offered to lend us his horse, as he expected to be in\ntown a few days. The offer was gratefully accepted, and within a\nquarter of an hour Manuel Flores had started for Shepherd’s with an\norder to the merchant to send in seven horses for us. It was less than\na two hours’ ride to the ferry, and with the early start we expected\nManuel to return before noon. Making ourselves at home in a coffeehouse\nconducted by a Mexican, Deweese ordered a few bottles of wine to\ncelebrate properly our drive and to entertain Cruze and our vaqueros.\nBefore the horses arrived, those of us who had any money left spent it\nin the _cantina_, not wishing to carry it home, where it would be\nuseless. The result was that on the return of Flores with mounts we\nwere all about three sheets in the wind, reckless and defiant.\n\nAfter saddling up, I suggested to June that we ride by the stage office\nand show Mr. Oxenford that we were independent of him. The stage stand\nand office were on the outskirts of the scattered village, and while we\ncould have avoided it, our _segundo_ willingly led the way, and called\nfor the junior member of the firm. A hostler came to the door and\ninformed us that Mr. Oxenford was not in.\n\n“Then I’ll just leave my card,” said Deweese, dismounting. Taking a\nbrown cigarette paper from his pocket, he wrote his name on it; then\npulling a tack from a notice pasted beside the office door, he drew his\nsix-shooter, and with it deftly tacked the cigarette paper against the\noffice door jamb. Remounting his horse, and perfectly conscious that\nOxenford was within hearing, he remarked to the hostler: “When your\nboss returns, please tell him that those fellows from Las Palomas will\nneither walk with him nor ride with him. We thought he might fret as to\nhow we were to get home, and we have just ridden by to tell him that he\nneed feel no uneasiness. Since I have never had the pleasure of an\nintroduction to him, I’ve put my name on that cigarette paper.\nGood-day, sir.”\n\nArriving at Shepherd’s, we rested several hours, and on the suggestion\nof the merchant changed horses before starting home. At the ferry we\nlearned that there had been no serious loss of cattle so far, but that\nnearly all the stock from the Frio and San Miguel had drifted across to\nthe Nueces. We also learned that the attendance on San Jacinto Day had\nbeen extremely light, not a person from Las Palomas being present,\nwhile the tournament for that year had been abandoned. During our ride\nup the river before darkness fell, we passed a strange medley of\nbrands, many of which Deweese assured me were owned from fifty to a\nhundred miles to the north and west. Riding leisurely, it was nearly\nmidnight when we sighted the ranch and found it astir. An extra breeze\nhad been blowing, and the vaqueros were starting to their work at the\nwells in order to be on hand the moment the wind slackened. Around the\ntwo wells at headquarters were over a thousand cattle, whose constant\nmoaning reached our ears over a mile from the ranch.\n\nOur return was like entering a house of mourning. Miss Jean barely\ngreeted Deweese and myself, while Uncle Lance paced the gallery without\nmaking a single inquiry as to what had become of the horse herd. On the\nmistress’s orders, servants set out a cold luncheon, and disappeared,\nas if in the presence of death, without a word of greeting. Ever\nthoughtful, Miss Jean added several little delicacies to our plain\nmeal, and, seating herself at the table with us, gave us a clear\noutline of the situation. In seventy odd miles of the meanderings of\nthe river across our range, there was not a pool to the mile with water\nenough for a hundred cattle. The wells were gradually becoming weaker,\nyielding less water every week, while of four new ones which were\ncommenced before our departure, two were dry and worthless. The\nvaqueros were then skinning on an average forty dead cattle a day,\nfully a half of which were in the Las Palomas brand. Sympathetically as\na sister could, she accounted for her brother’s lack of interest in our\nreturn by his anxiety and years, and she cautioned us to let no evil\nreport reach his ears, as this drouth had unnerved him.\n\nDeweese at once resumed his position on the ranch, and the next morning\nthe ranchero held a short council with him, authorizing him to spare no\nexpense to save the cattle. Deweese returned the borrowed horses by\nEnrique, and sent a letter to the merchant at the ferry, directing him\nto secure and send at least twenty men to Las Palomas. The first day\nafter our return, we rode the mills and the river. Convinced that to\nsink other wells on the mesas would be fruitless, the foreman decided\nto dig a number of shallow ones in the bed of the river, in the hope of\ncatching seepage water. Accordingly the next morning, I was sent with a\ncommissary wagon and seven men to the mouth of the Ganso, with\ninstructions to begin sinking wells about two miles apart. Taking with\nus such tools as we needed, we commenced our first well at the\nconfluence of the Ganso with the Nueces, and a second one above. From\ntimber along the river we cut the necessary temporary curbing, and put\nit in place as the wells were sunk. On the third day both wells became\nso wet as to impede our work, and on our foreman riding by, he ordered\nthem curbed to the bottom and a tripod set up over them on which to rig\na rope and pulley. The next morning troughs and rigging, with a\n_remuda_ of horses and a watering crew of four strange vaqueros,\narrived. The wells were only about twenty feet deep; but by drawing the\nwater as fast as the seepage accumulated, each was capable of watering\nseveral hundred head of cattle daily. By this time Deweese had secured\nample help, and started a second crew of well diggers opposite the\nranch, who worked down the river while my crew followed some fifteen\nmiles above. By the end of the month of May, we had some twenty\ntemporary wells in operation, and these, in addition to what water the\npools afforded, relieved the situation to some extent, though the\nravages of death by thirst went on apace among the weaker cattle.\n\nWith the beginning of June, we were operating nearly thirty wells. In\nsome cases two vaqueros could hoist all the water that accumulated in\nthree wells. We had a string of camps along the river, and at every\nwindmill on the mesas men were stationed night and day. Among the\ncattle, the death rate was increasing all over the range. Frequently we\ntook over a hundred skins in a single day, while at every camp cords of\nfallen flint hides were accumulating. The heat of summer was upon us,\nthe wind arose daily, sand storms and dust clouds swept across the\ncountry, until our once prosperous range looked like a desert, withered\nand accursed. Young cows forsook their offspring in the hour of their\nbirth. Motherless calves wandered about the range, hollow-eyed, their\npiteous appeals unheeded, until some lurking wolf sucked their blood\nand spread a feast to the vultures, constantly wheeling in great\nflights overhead. The prickly pear, an extremely arid plant, affording\nboth food and drink to herds during drouths, had turned white,\nblistered by the torrid sun until it had fallen down, lifeless. The\nchaparral was destitute of foliage, and on the divides and higher\nmesas, had died. The native women stripped their _jacals_ of every\nsacred picture, and hung them on the withered trees about their doors,\nwhere they hourly prayed to their patron saints. In the humblest homes\non Las Palomas, candles burned both night and day to appease the\nfrowning Deity.\n\nThe white element on the ranch worked almost unceasingly, stirring the\nMexicans to the greatest effort. The middle of June passed without a\ndrop of rain, but on the morning of the twentieth, after working all\nnight, as Pasquale Arispe and I were drawing water from a well on the\nborder of the encinal I felt a breeze spring up, that started the\nwindmill. Casting my eyes upward, I noticed that the wind had veered to\na quarter directly opposite to that of the customary coast breeze. Not\nbeing able to read aright the portent of the change in the wind, I had\nto learn from that native-born son of the soil: “Tomas,” he cried,\nriding up excitedly, “in three days it will rain! Listen to me:\nPasquale Arispe says that in three days the _arroyos_ on the hacienda\nof Don Lancelot will run like a mill-race. See, _companero_, the wind\nhas changed. The breeze is from the northwest this morning. Before\nthree days it will rain! Madre de Dios!”\n\nThe wind from the northwest continued steadily for two days, relieving\nus from work. On the morning of the third day the signs in sky and air\nwere plain for falling weather. Cattle, tottering with weakness, came\ninto the well, and after drinking, playfully kicked up their heels on\nleaving. Before noon the storm struck us like a cloud-burst. Pasquale\nand I took refuge under the wagon to avoid the hailstones. In spite of\nthe parched ground drinking to its contentment, water flooded under the\nwagon, driving us out. But we laughed at the violence of the deluge,\nand after making everything secure, saddled our horses and set out for\nhome, taking our relay mounts with us. It was fifteen miles to the\nranch and in the eye of the storm; but the loose horses faced the rain\nas if they enjoyed it, while those under saddle followed the free ones\nas a hound does a scent. Within two hours after leaving the well, we\nreined in at the gate, and I saw Uncle Lance and a number of the boys\npromenading the gallery. But the old ranchero leisurely walked down the\npathway to the gate, and amid the downpour shouted to us: “Turn those\nhorses loose; this ranch is going to take a month’s holiday.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\nIN COMMEMORATION\n\n\nA heavy rainfall continued the greater portion of two days. None of us\nventured away from the house until the weather settled, and meantime I\nplayed the fiddle almost continuously. Night work and coarse living in\ncamps had prepared us to enjoy the comforts of a house, as well as to\ndo justice to the well-laden table. Miss Jean prided herself, on\nspecial occasions and when the ranch had company, on good dinners; but\nin commemoration of the breaking of this drouth, with none but us boys\nto share it, she spread a continual feast. The Mexican contingent were\nnot forgotten by master or mistress, and the ranch supplies in the\nwarehouse were drawn upon, delicacies as well as staples, not only for\nthe _jacals_ about headquarters but also for the outlying ranchitas.\nThe native element had worked faithfully during the two years in which\nno rain to speak of had fallen, until the breaking hour, and were not\nforgotten in the hour of deliverance. Even the stranger vaqueros were\ncompelled to share the hospitality of Las Palomas like invited guests.\n\nWhile the rain continued falling, Uncle Lance paced the gallery almost\nnight and day. Fearful lest the downpour might stop, he stood guard,\nnoting every change in the rainfall, barely taking time to eat or catch\nan hour’s sleep. But when the grateful rain had continued until the\nevening of the second day, assuring a bountiful supply of water all\nover our range, he joined us at supper, exultant as a youth of twenty.\n“Boys,” said he, “this has been a grand rain. If our tanks hold, we\nwill be independent for the next eighteen months, and if not another\ndrop falls, the river ought to flow for a year. I have seen worse\ndrouths since I lived here, but what hurt us now was the amount of\ncattle and the heavy drift which flooded down on us from up the river\nand north on the Frio. The loss is nothing; we won’t notice it in\nanother year. I have kept a close tally of the hides taken, and our\nbrand will be short about two thousand, or less than ten per cent of\nour total numbers. They were principally old cows and will not be\nmissed. The calf crop this fall will be short, but taking it up one\nside and down the other, we got off lucky.”\n\nThe third day after the rain began the sun rose bright and clear. Not a\nhoof of cattle or horses was in sight, and though it was midsummer, the\nfreshness of earth and air was like that of a spring morning. Every one\nfelt like riding. While awaiting the arrival of saddle horses, the\nextra help hired during the drouth was called in and settled with. Two\nbrothers, Fidel and Carlos Trujillo, begged for permanent employment.\nThey were promising young fellows, born on the Aransas River, and after\nconsulting with Deweese Uncle Lance took both into permanent service on\nthe ranch. A room in an outbuilding was allotted them, and they were\ninstructed to get their meals in the kitchen. The _remudas_ had\nwandered far, but one was finally brought in by a vaquero, and by pairs\nwe mounted and rode away. On starting, the tanks demanded our first\nattention, and finding all four of them safe, we threw out of gear all\nthe windmills. Theodore Quayle and I were partners during the day’s\nride to the south, and on coming in at evening fell in with Uncle Lance\nand our _segundo_, who had been as far west as the Ganso. Quayle and I\nhad discussed during the day the prospect of a hunt at the Vaux ranch,\nand on meeting our employer, artfully interested the old ranchero\nregarding the amount of cat sign seen that day along the Arroyo Sordo.\n\n“It’s hard luck, boys,” said he, “to find ourselves afoot, and the\nhunting so promising. But we haven’t a horse on the ranch that could\ncarry a man ten miles in a straightaway dash after the hounds. It will\nbe a month yet before the grass has substance enough in it to\nstrengthen our _remudas_. Oh, if it hadn’t been for the condition of\nsaddle stock, Don Pierre would have come right through the rain\nyesterday. But when Las Palomas can’t follow the hounds for lack of\nmounts, you can depend on it that other ranches can’t either. It just\nmakes me sick to think of this good hunting, but what can we do for a\nmonth but fold our hands and sit down? But if you boys are itching for\nan excuse to get over on the Frio, why, I’ll make you a good one. This\ndrouth has knocked all the sociability out of the country; but now the\nordeal is past, Theodore is in honor bound to go over to the Vaux\nranch. I don’t suppose you boys have seen the girls on the Frio and San\nMiguel in six months. Time? That’s about all we have got right now.\nTime?—we’ve got time to burn.”\n\nOur feeler had borne fruit. An excuse or permission to go to the Frio\nwas what Quayle and I were after, though no doubt the old matchmaker\nwas equally anxious to have us go. In expressing our thanks for the\npromised vacation, we included several provisos—in case there was\nnothing to do, or if we concluded to go—when Uncle Lance turned in his\nsaddle and gave us a withering look. “I’ve often wondered,” said he,\n“if the blood in you fellows is really red, or if it’s white like a\nfish’s. Now, when I was your age, I had to steal chances to go to see\nmy girl. But I never gave her any show to forget me, and worried her to\na fare-ye-well. And if my observation and years go for anything, that’s\njust the way girls like to have a fellow act. Of course they’ll bluff\nand let on they must be wooed and all that, just like Frances did at\nthe tournament a year ago. I contend that with a clear field the only\nway to make any progress in sparking a girl, is to get one arm around\nher waist, and with the other hand keep her from scratching you. That’s\nthe very way they like to be courted.”\n\nTheodore and I dropped behind after this lecture, and before we reached\nthe ranch had agreed to ride over to the Frio the next morning. During\nour absence that day, there had arrived at Las Palomas from the\nMission, a _padrino_ in the person of Don Alejandro Travino. Juana\nLeal, only daughter of Tiburcio, had been sought in marriage by a\nnephew of Don Alejandro, and the latter, dignified as a Castilian\nnoble, was then at the house negotiating for the girl’s hand. Juana was\nnearly eighteen, had been born at the ranch, and after reaching years\nof usefulness had been adopted into Miss Jean’s household. To ask for\nher hand required audacity, for to master and mistress of Las Palomas\nit was like asking for a daughter of the house. Miss Jean was agitated\nand all in a flutter; Tiburcio and his wife were struck dumb; for Juana\nwas the baby and only unmarried one of their children, and to take her\nfrom Las Palomas—they could never consent to that. But Uncle Lance had\ngone through such experiences before, and met the emergency with\npromptness.\n\n“That’s all right, little sister,” said the old matchmaker to Miss\nJean, who had come out to the gate where we were unsaddling. “Don’t you\nborrow any trouble in this matter—leave things to me. I’ve handled\ntrifles like this among these natives for nearly forty years now, and I\ndon’t see any occasion to try and make out a funeral right after the\ndrouth’s been broken by a fine rain. Shucks, girl, this is a time for\nrejoicing! You go back in the house and entertain Don Alejandro with\nyour best smiles till I come in. I want to have a talk with Tiburcio\nand his wife before I meet the _padrino_. There’s several families of\nthose Travinos over around the Mission and I want to locate which tribe\nthis _oso_ comes from. Some of them are good people and some of them\nneed a rope around their necks, and in a case of keeps like getting\nmarried, it’s always safe to know what’s what and who’s who. Now, Sis,\ngo on back in the house and entertain the Don. Come with me, Tom.”\n\nI saw our plans for the morrow vanish into thin air. On arriving at the\njacal, we were admitted, but a gloom like the pall of death seemed to\nenvelop the old Mexican couple. When we had taken seats around a small\ntable, Tia Inez handed the ranchero the formal written request. As it\nwas penned in Spanish, it was passed to me to read, and after running\nthrough it hastily, I read it aloud, several times stopping to\ninterpret to Uncle Lance certain extravagant phrases. The salutatory\nwas in the usual form; the esteem which each family had always\nentertained for the other was dwelt upon at length, and choicer\nlanguage was never used than the _padrino_ penned in asking for the\nhand of Doña Juana. This dainty missive was signed by the godfather of\nthe swain, Don Alejandro Travino, whose rubric riotously ran back and\nforth entirely across the delicately tinted sheet. On the conclusion of\nthe reading, Uncle Lance brushed the letter aside as of no moment, and,\nturning to the old couple, demanded to know to which branch of the\nTravino family young Don Blas belonged.\n\nThe account of Tiburcio and his wife was definite and clear. The father\nof the swain conducted a small country store at the Mission, and\nbesides had landed and cattle interests. He was a younger brother of\nDon Alejandro, who was the owner of a large land grant, had cattle in\nabundance, and was a representative man among the Spanish element. No\nbetter credentials could have been asked. But when their patron rallied\nthem as to the cause of their gloom, Tia Inez burst into tears,\nadmitting the match was satisfactory, but her baby would be carried\naway from Las Palomas and she might never see her again. Her two sons\nwho lived at the ranch, allowed no day to pass without coming to see\ntheir mother, and the one who lived at a distant ranchita came at every\nopportunity. But if her little girl was carried away to a distant\nranch—ah! that made it impossible! Let Don Lance, worthy patron of his\npeople, forbid the match, and win the gratitude of an anguished mother.\nInvoking the saints to guide her aright, Doña Inez threw herself on the\nbed in hysterical lamentation. Realizing it is useless to argue with a\nwoman in tears, the old matchmaker suggested to Tiburcio that we delay\nthe answer the customary fortnight.\n\nPromising to do nothing further without consulting them, we withdrew\nfrom the _jacal_. On returning to the house, we found Miss Jean\nentertaining the Don to the best of her ability, and, commanding my\npresence, the old matchmaker advanced to meet the _padrino_, with whom\nhe had a slight acquaintance. Bidding his guest welcome to the ranch,\nhe listened to the Don’s apology for being such a stranger to Las\nPalomas until a matter of a delicate nature had brought him hither.\n\nDon Alejandro was a distinguished-looking man, and spoke his native\ntongue in a manner which put my efforts as an interpreter to shame. The\nconversation was allowed to drift at will, from the damages of the\nrecent drouth to the prospect of a market for beeves that fall, until\nsupper was announced. After the evening repast was over we retired to\nthe gallery, and Uncle Lance reopened the matchmaking by inquiring of\nDon Alejandro if his nephew proposed taking his bride to the Mission.\nThe Don was all attention. Fortunately, anticipating that the question\nmight arise, he had discussed that very feature with his nephew. At\npresent the young man was assisting his father at the Mission, and in\ntime, no doubt, would succeed to the business. However, realizing that\nher living fifty miles distant might be an objection to the girl’s\nparents, he was not for insisting on that point, as no doubt Las\nPalomas offered equally good advantages for business. He simply\nmentioned this by way of suggestion, and invited the opinion of his\nhost.\n\n“Well, now, Don Alejandro,” said the old matchmaker, in flutelike\ntones, “we are a very simple people here at Las Palomas. Breeding a few\nhorses and mules for home purposes, and the rearing of cattle has been\nour occupation. As to merchandising here at the ranch, I could not\ncountenance it, as I refused that privilege to the stage company when\nthey offered to run past Las Palomas. At present our few wants are\nsupplied by a merchant at Shepherd’s Ferry. True, it’s thirty miles,\nbut I sometimes wish it was farther, as it is quite a temptation to my\nboys to ride down there on various pretexts. We send down every week\nfor our mail and such little necessities as the ranch may need. If\nthere was a store here, it would attract loafers and destroy the peace\nand contentment which we now enjoy. I would object to it; ‘one man to\nhis trade and another to his merchandise.’”\n\nThe _padrino_, with good diplomacy, heartily agreed that a store was a\ndisturbing feature on a ranch, and instantly went off on a tangent on\nthe splendid business possibilities of the Mission. The matchmaker in\nreturn agreed as heartily with him, and grew reminiscent. “In the\nspring of ’51,” said he, “I made the match between Tiburcio and Doña\nInez, father and mother of Juana. Tiburcio was a vaquero of mine at the\ntime, Inez being a Mission girl, and I have taken a great interest in\nthe couple ever since. All their children were born here and still live\non the ranch. Understand, Don Alejandro, I have no personal feeling in\nthe matter, beyond the wishes of the parents of the girl. My sister has\ntaken a great interest in Juana, having had the girl under her charge\nfor the past eight years. Of course, I feel a pride in Juana, and she\nis a fine girl. If your nephew wins her, I shall tell the lucky rascal\nwhen he comes to claim her that he has won the pride of Las Palomas. I\ntake it, Don Alejandro, that your visit and request was rather\nunexpected here, though I am aware that Juana has visited among cousins\nat the Mission several times the past few years. But that she had lost\nher heart to some of your gallants comes as a surprise to me, and from\nwhat I learn, to her parents also. Under the circumstances, if I were\nyou, I would not urge an immediate reply, but give them the customary\nperiod to think it over. Our vaqueros will not be very busy for some\ntime to come, and it will not inconvenience us to send a reply by\nmessenger to the Mission. And tell Don Blas, even should the reply be\nunfavorable, not to be discouraged. Women, you know, are peculiar. Ah,\nDon Alejandro, when you and I were young and went courting, would we\nhave been discouraged by a first refusal?”\n\nSeñor Travino appreciated the compliment, and, with a genial smile,\nslapped his host on the back, while the old matchmaker gave vent to a\nvociferous guffaw. The conversation thereafter took several tacks, but\nalways reverted to the proposed match. As the hour grew late, the host\napologized to his guest, as no doubt he was tired by his long ride, and\noffered to show him his room. The _padrino_ denied all weariness,\nmaintaining that the enjoyable evening had rested him, but reluctantly\nallowed himself to be shown to his apartment. No sooner were the\ngood-nights spoken, than the old ranchero returned, and, snapping his\nfingers for attention, motioned me to follow. By a circuitous route we\nreached the _jacal_ of Tiburcio. The old couple had not yet retired,\nand Juana blushingly admitted us. Uncle Lance jollied the old people\nlike a robust, healthy son amusing his elders. We took seats as before\naround the small table, and Uncle Lance scattered the gloom of the\n_jacal_ with his gayety.\n\n“Las Palomas forever!” said he, striking the table with his bony fist.\n“This _padrino_ from the Mission is a very fine gentleman but a poor\nmatchmaker. Just because young Don Blas is the son of a Travino, the\nkeeper of a picayune _tienda_ at the Mission, was that any reason to\npresume for the hand of a daughter of Las Palomas? Was he any better\nthan a vaquero just because he doled out _frijoles_ by the quart, and\nnever saw a piece of money larger than a _media real_? Why, a Las\nPalomas vaquero was a prince compared to a fawning attendant in a\nMission store. Let Tia Inez stop fretting herself about losing Juana—it\nwould not be yet awhile. Just leave matters to him, and he’d send Don\nAlejandro home, pleased with his visit and hopeful over the match, even\nif it never took place. And none of those frowns from the young lady!”\n\nAs we all arose at parting, the old matchmaker went over to Juana and,\nshaking his finger at her, said: “Now, look here, my little girl, your\nmistress, your parents, and myself are all interested in you, and don’t\nthink we won’t act for your best interests. You’ve seen this young\nfellow ride by on a horse several times, haven’t you? Danced with him a\nfew times under the eyes of a chaperon at the last _fiesta_, haven’t\nyou? And that’s all you care to know, and are ready to marry him. Well,\nwell, it’s fortunate that the marriage customs of the Mexicans protect\nsuch innocents as you. Now, if young Don Blas had worked under me for a\nyear as a vaquero, I might be as ready to the match as you are; for\nthen I’d know whether he was worthy of you. What does a girl of your\nage know about a man? But when you have as many gray hairs in your head\nas your mother has, you’ll thank me for cautioning every one to proceed\nslowly in this match. Now dry those tears and go to your mother.”\n\nThe next morning Don Alejandro proposed returning to the Mission. But\nthe old ranchero hooted the idea, and informed his guest that he had\nordered the ambulance, as he intended showing him the recent\nimprovements made on Las Palomas. When the guest protested against a\nlonger absence from home, the host artfully intimated that by remaining\nanother day a favorable reply might possibly go with him. Don Alejandro\nfinally consented. I was pressed in as driver and interpreter, and our\nteam tore away from the ranch with a flourish. To put it mildly, I was\ndisgusted at having my plans for the day knocked in the head, yet knew\nbetter than protest. As we drove along, myriads of grass-blades were\npeeping up since the rain, giving every view a greenish cast. Nearly\nevery windmill on the ranch on our circuit was pointed out, and we\npassed three of our four tanks, one of which was over half a mile in\nlength. After stopping at an outlying ranchita for refreshment, we\nspent the afternoon in a similar manner. From a swell of the prairie\nsome ten miles to the westward of the ranch, we could distinctly see an\noutline of the Ganso. Halting the ambulance, the old ranchero pointed\nout to his guest the meanderings of that creek from its confluence with\nthe parent stream until it became lost in the hills to the southward.\n\n“That tract of ground,” said he, “is my last landed addition to Las\nPalomas. It lies north and south, giving me six miles’ frontage on the\nNueces. and extending north of the river about four miles, Don\nAlejandro, when I note the great change which has come over this valley\nsince I settled here, it convinces me that if one wishes to follow\nranching he had better acquire title to what range he needs. Land has\nadvanced in price from a few cents an acre to four bits, and now they\nsay the next generation will see it worth a dollar. This Ganso grant\ncontains a hundred and fourteen sections, and I have my eye on one or\ntwo other adjoining tracts. My generation will not need it, but the one\nwho succeeds me may. Now, as we drive home, I’ll try to show you the\nnorthern boundary of our range; it’s fairly well outlined by the divide\nbetween the Nueces and the Frio rivers.”\n\nFrom the conversation which followed until we reached headquarters, I\nreadily understood that the old matchmaker was showing the rose and\nconcealing its thorn. His motive was not always clear to me, for one\nwould have supposed from his almost boastful claims regarding its\nextent and carrying capacity for cattle, he was showing the ranch to a\nprospective buyer. But as we neared home, the conversation innocently\ndrifted to the Mexican element and their love for the land to which\nthey were born. Then I understood why I was driving four mules instead\nof basking in the smiles of my own sweetheart on the San Miguel. Nor\ndid this boasting cease during the evening, but alternated from lands\nand cattle to the native people, and finally centred about a Mexican\ngirl who had been so fortunate as to have been born to the soil of Las\nPalomas.\n\nWhen Don Alejandro asked for his horse the following morning on\nleaving, Uncle Lance, Quayle, and myself formed a guard of honor to\nescort our guest a distance on his way. He took leave of the mistress\nof Las Palomas in an obeisance worthy of an old-time cavalier. Once we\nwere off, Uncle Lance pretended to have had a final interview with the\nparents, in which they had insisted on the customary time in which to\nconsider the proposal. The _padrino_ graciously accepted the situation,\nthanking his host for his interest in behalf of his nephew. On reaching\nthe river, where our ways separated, all halted for a few minutes at\nparting.\n\n“Well, Don Alejandro,” said the old ranchero, “this is my limit of\nescort to guests of the ranch. Now, the only hope I have in parting is,\nin case the reply should he unfavorable, that Don Blas will not be\ndiscouraged and that we may see you again at Las Palomas. Tender my\ncongratulations to your nephew, and tell him that a welcome always\nawaits him in case he finds time and inclination to visit us. I take\nsome little interest in matches. These boys of mine are going north to\nthe Frio on a courting errand to-day. But our marriage customs are\ninferior to yours, and our young people, left to themselves, don’t seem\nto marry. Don Alejandro, if you and I had the making of the matches,\nthere’d be a cradle rocking in every _jacal_.” Both smiled, said their\n“Adios, amigos,” and he was gone.\n\nAs our guest cantered away, down the river road, Quayle and I began\nlooking for a ford. The river had been on a rampage, and while we were\nseeking out a crossing our employer had time for a few comments. “The\nDon’s tickled with his prospects. He thinks he’s got a half inch rope\non Juana right now; but if I thought your prospects were no better than\nI know his are, you wouldn’t tire any horse-flesh of mine by riding to\nthe Frio and the San Miguel. But go right on, and stay as long as you\nwant to, for I’m in no hurry to see your faces again. Tom, with the ice\nbroken as it is, as soon as Esther can remove her disabilities—well,\nyou won’t have to run off the next time. And Theodore, remember what I\ntold you the other day about sparking a girl. You’re too timid and\nbackward for a young fellow. I don’t care if you come home with one eye\nscratched out, just so you and Frances have come to an understanding\nand named the day.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\nMATCHMAKING\n\n\nAfter our return to the Frio, my first duty was writing, relative to\nthe proposed match, an unfavorable reply to Don Alejandro Travino.\n\nOn resuming work, we spent six weeks baling hides, thus occupying our\ntime until the beginning of the branding season. A general round-up of\nthe Nueces valley, commencing on the coast at Corpus Christi Bay, had\nbeen agreed upon among the cowmen of the country. In pursuance of the\nplan four well-mounted men were sent from our ranch with Wilson’s wagon\nto the coast, our _segundo_ following a week later with the wagon,\n_remuda_ and twelve men, to meet the rodeo at San Patricio as they\nworked up the river. Our cattle had drifted in every direction during\nthe drouth and though many of them had returned since the range had\nagain become good, they were still widely scattered. So Uncle Lance\ntook the rest of us and started for the Frio, working down that river\nand along the Nueces, until we met the round-up coming up from below.\nDuring this cow hunt, I carried my fiddle with me in the wagon, and at\nnearly every ranch we passed we stopped and had a dance. Not over once\na week did we send in cattle to the ranch to brand, and on meeting the\nrodeo from below, Deweese had over three thousand of our cattle. After\ntaking these in and branding the calves, we worked over our home range\nuntil near the holidays.\n\nOn our return to the ranch, we learned that young Blas Travino from the\nMission had passed Las Palomas some days before. He had stopped in\npassing; but, finding the ranchero absent, plead a matter of business\nat Santa Maria, promising to call on his return. He was then at the\nranch on the Tarancalous, and hourly expecting his reappearance, the\nwomen of the household were in an agitated state of mind. Since the\nformal answer had been sent, no word had come from Don Blas and a rival\nhad meanwhile sprung up in the person of Fidel Trujillo. Within a month\nafter his employment I noticed the new vaquero casting shy glances at\nJuana, but until the cow hunt on the Frio I did not recognize the fine\nhandwriting of the old matchmaker. Though my services were never called\nfor as interpreter between Uncle Lance and the new man, any one could\nsee there was an understanding between them. That the old ranchero was\npushing Fidel forward was evident during the fall cow hunting by his\nsending that Mexican into Las Palomas with every bunch of cattle\ngathered.\n\nThat evening Don Blas rode into the ranch, accompanied by Father\nNorquin. The priest belonged at the Mission, and their meeting at Santa\nMaria might, of course, have been accidental. None of the padre’s\nparishioners at headquarters were expecting him, however, for several\nmonths, and padres are able _padrinos_,—sometimes, among their own\nfaith, even despotic. Taking account, as it appeared, of the ulterior\nmotive, Uncle Lance welcomed the arrivals with a hearty hospitality,\nwhich to a stranger seemed so genuine as to dispel any suspicion. Not\nin many a day had a visitor at Las Palomas received more courteous\nconsideration than did Father Norquin. The choicest mint which grew in\nthe inclosures about the wells was none too good for the juleps which\nwere concocted by Miss Jean. Had the master and mistress of the ranch\nbeen communicants of his church, the rosy-cheeked padre could have\nreceived no more marked attention.\n\nThe conversation touched lightly on various topics, until Santa Maria\nranch was mentioned, when Uncle Lance asked the padre if Don Mateo had\nyet built him a chapel. The priest shrugged his shoulders deprecatingly\nand answered the question with another,—when Las Palomas proposed\nbuilding a place of worship.\n\n“Well, Father, I’m glad you’ve brought the matter up again,” replied\nthe host. “That I should have lived here over forty years and never\ndone anything for your church or my people who belong to your faith, is\ncertainly saying little in my behalf. I never had the matter brought\nhome to me so clearly as during last summer’s drouth. Do you remember\nthat old maxim regarding when the devil was sick? Well, I was good and\nsick. If you had happened in then and had asked for a chapel,—not that\nI have any confidence in your teaching,—you could have got a church\nwith a steeple on it. I was in such sore straits that the women were\nkept busy making candles, and we burnt them in every _jacal_ until the\nhour of deliverance.”\n\nHelping himself from the proffered snuffbox of the padre, the host\nturned to his guest, and in all sincerity continued: “Yes, Father, I\nought to build you a nice place of worship. We could quarry the rock\nduring idle time, and burn our own lime right here on the ranch. While\nyou are here, give me some plans, and we’ll show you that the white\nelement of Las Palomas are not such hopeless heretics as you suppose.\nNow, if we build the chapel, I’m just going to ask one favor in return:\nI expect to die and be buried on this ranch. You’re a younger man by\ntwenty years and will outlive me, and on the day of my burial I want\nyou to lay aside your creed and preach my funeral in this little chapel\nwhich you and I are going to build. I have been a witness to the\nself-sacrifice of you and other priests ever since I lived here.\nFather, I like an honest man, and the earnestness of your cloth for the\nbetterment of my people no one can question. And my covenant is, that\nyou are to preach a simple sermon, merely commemorating the fact that\nhere lived a man named Lovelace, who died and would be seen among his\nfellow men no more. These being facts, you can mention them; but beyond\nthat, for fear our faiths might differ, the less said the better. Won’t\nyou have another mint julep before supper? No? You will, won’t you, Don\nBlas?”\n\nThat the old ranchero was in earnest about building a chapel on Las\nPalomas there was no doubt. In fact, the credit should be given to Miss\nJean, for she had been urging the matter ever since my coming to the\nranch. At headquarters and outlying ranchitas on the land, there were\nnearly twenty families, or over a hundred persons of all ages. But that\nthe old matchmaker was going to make the most out of his opportunity by\nerecting the building at an opportune time, there was not the shadow of\na question.\n\nThe evening passed without mention of the real errand of our guests.\nThe conversation was allowed to wander at will, during which several\ntimes it drifted into gentle repartee between host and padre, both\nartfully avoiding the rock of matchmaking. But the next morning, as if\nanxious to begin the day’s work early, Father Norquin, on arising,\ninquired for his host, strutted out to the corrals, and, on meeting\nhim, promptly inquired why, during the previous summer, Don Alejandro\nTravino’s mission to obtain the hand of Juana Leal had failed.\n\n“That’s so,” assented Uncle Lance, very affably, “Don Alejandro was\nhere as godfather to his nephew. And this young man with you is Don\nBlas, the bear? Well, why did we waste so much time last night talking\nabout chapels and death when we might have made a match in less time?\nYou priests have everything in your favor as _padrinos_, but you are so\nslow that a rival might appear and win the girl while you were drumming\nup your courage. I don’t write Spanish myself, but I have boys here on\nthe ranch who do. One of them, if I remember rightly, wrote the answer\nat the request of Juana’s mother. If my memory hasn’t failed me\nentirely, the parents objected to being separated from their only\ndaughter. You know how that is among your people; and I never like to\ninterfere in family matters. But from what I hear Don Blas has a rival\nnow. Yes; young Travino failed to press his suit, and a girl will stand\nfor nearly anything but neglect. But that’s one thing they won’t stand\nfor, not when there’s a handsome fellow at hand to play the bear. Then\nthe old lover is easily forgotten for the new. Eh, Father?”\n\n“Ah, Don Lance, I know your reputation as a matchmaker,” replied Father\nNorquin, in a rich French accent. “Report says had you not had a hand\nin it the match would have been successful. The supposition is that it\nonly lacked your approval. The daughter of a vaquero refusing a\nTravino? Tut, tut, man!”\n\nA hearty guffaw greeted these aspersions. “And so you’ve heard I was a\nmatchmaker, have you? Of course, you believed it just like any other\nold granny. Now, of course, when I’m asked by any of my people to act\nas _padrino_, I never refuse any more than you do. I’ve made many a\nmatch and hope to be spared to make several more. But come; they’re\ncalling us to breakfast, and after that we’ll take a walk over to the\nranch burying ground. It’s less than a half mile—in that point of\nencinal yonder. I want to show you what I think would be a nice spot\nfor our chapel.”\n\nThe conversation during breakfast was artfully directed by the host to\navoid the dangerous shoals, though the padre constantly kept an eye on\nJuana as she passed back and forth. As we arose from the table and were\npassing to the gallery, Uncle Lance nudged the priest, and, poking Don\nBlas in the ribs, said: “Isn’t Juana a stunning fine cook? Got up that\nbreakfast herself. There isn’t an eighteen-year-old girl in Texas who\ncan make as fine biscuits as she does. But Las Palomas raises just as\nfine girls as she does horses and cattle. The rascal who gets her for a\nwife can thank his lucky stars. Don Blas, you ought to have me for\n_padrino_. Your uncle and the padre here are too poky. Why, if I was\nmaking a match for as fine a girl as Juana is, I’d set the river afire\nbefore I’d let an unfavorable answer discourage me. Now, the padre and\nI are going for a short walk, and we’ll leave you here at the house to\nwork out your own salvation. Don’t pay any attention to the mistress,\nand I want to tell you right now, if you expect to win Juana, never\ndepend on old fogy _padrinos_ like your uncle and Father Norquin. Do a\nlittle hustling for yourself.”\n\nThe old ranchero and the priest were gone nearly an hour, and on their\nreturn looked at another site in the rear of the Mexican quarters. It\nwas a pretty knoll, and as the two joined us where we were repairing a\nwindmill at the corrals, Father Norquin, in an ecstasy of delight,\nsaid: “Well, my children, the chapel is assured at Las Palomas. Don\nLance wanted to build it over in the encinal, with twice as nice a site\nright here in the rancho. We may need the building for a school some\nday, and if we should, we don’t want it a mile away. The very idea! And\nthe master tells me that a chapel has been the wish of his sister for\nyears. Poor woman—to have such a brother. I must hasten to the house\nand thank her.”\n\nNo sooner had the padre started than I was called aside by my employer.\n“Tom,” said he, “you slip around to Tia Inez’s _jacal_ and tell her\nthat I’m going to send Father Norquin over to see her. Tell her to\nstand firm on not letting Juana leave the ranch for the Mission. Tell\nher that I’ve promised the padre a chapel for Las Palomas, and rather\nthan miss it, the priest would consign the whole Travino family to\nendless perdition. Tell her to laugh at his scoldings and inform him\nthat Juana can get a husband without going so far. And that you heard\nme say that I was going to give Fidel, the day he married her daughter,\nthe same number of heifers that all her brothers got. Impress it on Tia\nInez’s mind that it means something to be born to Las Palomas.”\n\nI set out on my errand and he hastened away to overtake the padre\nbefore the latter reached the house. Tia Inez welcomed me, no doubt\nanticipating that I was the bearer of some message. When I gave her the\nmessage her eyes beamed with gratitude and she devoutly crossed her\nbreast invoking the blessing of the saints upon the master. I added a\nfew words of encouragement of my own—that I understood that when we\nquarried the rock for the chapel, there was to be enough extra cut to\nbuild a stone cottage for Juana and Fidel. This was pure invention on\nmy part, but I felt a very friendly interest in Las Palomas, for I\nexpected to bring my bride to it as soon as possible. Therefore, if I\ncould help the present match forward by the use of a little fiction,\nwhy not?\n\nFather Norquin’s time was limited at Las Palomas, as he was under\nappointment to return to Santa Maria that evening. Therefore it became\nan active morning about the ranch. Long before we had finished the\nrepairs on the windmill, a _mozo_ from the house came out to the\ncorrals to say I was wanted by the master. Returning with the servant,\nI found Uncle Lance and the mistress of the ranch entertaining their\ncompany before a cheerful fire in the sitting-room. On my entrance, my\nemployer said:—\n\n“Tom, I have sent for you because I want you to go over with the padre\nto the _jacal_ of Juana’s parents. Father Norquin here is such an old\ngranny that he believes I interfered, or the reply of last summer would\nhave been favorable. Now, Tom, you’re not to open your mouth one way or\nthe other. The padre will state his errand, and the old couple will\nanswer him in your presence. Don Blas will remain here, and whatever\nthe answer is, he and I must abide by it. Really, as I have said, I\nhave no interest in the match, except the welfare of the girl. Go on\nnow, Father, and let’s see what you can do as a _padrino_.”\n\nAs we arose to go, Miss Jean interposed and suggested that, out of\ndeference to Father Norquin, the old couple be sent for, but her\nbrother objected. He wanted the parents to make their own answer\nbeneath their own roof, unembarrassed by any influence. As we left the\nroom, the old matchmaker accompanied us as far as the gate, where he\nhalted and said to the padre:—\n\n“Father Norquin, in a case like the present, you will not mind my\nsaying that your wish is not absolute, and I am sending a witness with\nyou to see that you issue no peremptory orders on this ranch. And\nremember, that this old couple have been over thirty years in my\nemploy, and temper your words to them as you would to your own parents,\nwere they living. Juana was born here, which means a great deal, and\nwith the approval of her parents, she’ll marry the man of her choice,\nand no _padrino_, let him be priest or layman, can crack his whip on\nthe soil of Las Palomas to the contrary. As my guest, you must excuse\nme for talking so plain, but my people are as dear to me as your church\nis to you.”\n\nAs my employer turned and leisurely walked back to the house, Father\nNorquin stood stock-still. I was slightly embarrassed myself, but it\nwas easily to be seen that the padre’s plans had received a severe\nshock. I made several starts toward the Mexican quarters before the\npriest shook away his hesitations and joined me. That the old\nranchero’s words had agitated him was very evident in his voice and\nmanner. Several times he stopped me and demanded explanations, finally\nraising the question of a rival. I told him all I knew about the\nmatter; that Fidel, a new vaquero on the ranch, had found favor in\nJuana’s eyes, that he was a favorite man with master and mistress, but\nwhat view the girl’s parents took of the matter I was unable to say.\nThis cleared up the situation wonderfully, and the padre brightened as\nwe neared the _jacal_.\n\nTiburcio was absent, and while awaiting his return, the priest became\namiable and delivered a number of messages from friends and relatives\nat the Mission. Tia Inez was somewhat embarrassed at first, but\ngradually grew composed, and before the return of her husband all three\nof us were chatting like cronies. On the appearance of Tio Tiburcio,\ncoffee was ordered and the padre told several good stories, over which\nwe all laughed heartily. Cigarettes were next, and in due time Father\nNorquin very good naturedly inquired why an unfavorable answer,\nregarding the marriage of their daughter with young Blas Travino, had\nbeen returned the previous summer. The old couple looked at each other\na moment, when the husband turned in his chair, and with a shrug of his\nshoulders and a jerk of his head, referred the priest to his wife. Tia\nInez met the padre’s gaze, and in a clear, concise manner, and in her\nnative tongue, gave her reasons. Father Norquin explained the\nprominence of the Travino family and their disappointment over the\nrefusal, and asked if the decision was final, to which he received an\naffirmative reply. Instead of showing any displeasure, he rose to take\nhis departure, turning in the doorway to say to the old couple:—\n\n“My children, peace and happiness in this life is a priceless blessing.\nI should be untrue to my trust did I counsel a marriage that would give\na parent a moment of unhappiness. My blessing upon this house and its\ndwellers, and upon its sons and daughters as they go forth to homes of\ntheir own.” While he lifted his hand in benediction, the old couple and\nmyself bowed our heads for a moment, after which the padre and I passed\noutside.\n\nI was as solemn as an owl, yet inwardly delighted at the turn of\naffairs. But Father Norquin had nothing to conceal, while delight was\nwreathed all over his rosy countenance. Again and again he stopped me\nto make inquiries about Fidel, the new vaquero. That lucky rascal was a\ngood-looking native, a much larger youth than the aspiring Don Blas,\nand I pictured him to the padre as an Adonis. To the question if he was\nin the ranch at present, fortune favored me, as Fidel and nearly all\nthe regular vaqueros were cutting timbers in the encinal that day with\nwhich to build new corrals at one of the outlying tanks. As he would\nnot return before dark, and I knew the padre was due at Santa Maria\nthat evening, my description of him made Don Blas a mere pigmy in\ncomparison. But we finally reached the house, and on our reëntering the\nsitting-room, young Travino very courteously arose and stood until\nFather Norquin should be seated. But the latter faced his parishioner,\nsaying:—\n\n“You young simpleton, what did you drag me up here for on a fool’s\nerrand? I was led to believe that our generous host was the instigator\nof the unfavorable answer to your uncle’s negotiations last summer. Now\nI have the same answer repeated from the lips of the girl’s parents.\nConsider the predicament in which you have placed a servant of the\nChurch. Every law of hospitality has been outraged through your\nimbecility. And to complete my humiliation, I have received only\nkindness on every hand. The chapel which I have desired for years is\nnow a certainty, thanks to the master and mistress of Las Palomas. What\napology can I offer for your”—\n\n“Hold on there, Father,” interrupted Uncle Lance. “If you owe this\nranch any apology, save your breath for a more important occasion. Don\nBlas is all right; any suitor who would not be jealous over a girl like\nJuana is not welcome at Las Palomas. Why, when I was his age I was\nsuspicious of my sweetheart’s own father, and you should make allowance\nfor this young man’s years and impetuosity. Sit down, Father, and let’s\nhave a talk about this chapel—that’s what interests me most right now.\nYou see, within a few days my boys will have all the palisades cut for\nthe new corrals, and then we can turn our attention to getting out the\nrock for the chapel. We have a quarry of nice soft stone all opened up,\nand I’ll put a dozen vaqueros to blocking out the rock in a few days.\nWe always have a big stock of _zacahuiste_ grass on hand for thatching\n_jacals_, plenty of limestone to burn for the lime, sand in abundance,\nand all we lack is the masons. You’ll have to send them out from the\nMission, but I’ll pay them. Oh, I reckon the good Lord loves Las\nPalomas, for you see He’s placed everything convenient with which to\nbuild the chapel.”\n\nFather Norquin could not remain seated, but paced the room enumerating\nthe many little adornments which the mother church would be glad to\nsupply. Enthusiastic as a child over a promised toy, no other thought\nentered the simple padre’s mind, until dinner was announced. And all\nduring the meal, the object of our guest’s mission was entirely lost\nsight of, in contemplation of the coming chapel. The padre seemed as\nanxious to avoid the subject of matchmaking as his host, while poor Don\nBlas sat like a willing sacrifice, unable to say a word. I sympathized\nwith him, for I knew what it was to meet disappointment. At the\nconclusion of the mid-day repast, Father Norquin flew into a great\nbustle in preparing to start for Santa Maria, and I was dispatched for\nthe horses. Our guests and my employer were waiting at the stile when I\nled up their mounts, and at final parting the old matchmaker said to\nthe priest:—\n\n“Now, remember, I expect you to have this chapel completed by Easter\nSunday, when I want you to come out and spend at least two weeks with\nus and see that it is finished to suit you, and arrange for the\ndedication. Las Palomas will build the chapel, but when our work is\ndone yours commences. And I want to tell you right now, there’s liable\nto be several weddings in it before the mortar gets good and dry. I\nhave it on pretty good authority that one of my boys and Pierre Vaux’s\neldest girl are just about ready to have you pronounce them man and\nwife. No, he’s not of any faith, but she’s a good Catholic. Now, look\nhere, Father Norquin, if I have to proselyte you to my way of thinking,\nit’ll never hurt you any. I was never afraid to do what was right, and\nwhen at Las Palomas you needn’t be afraid either, even if we have to\nstart a new creed. Well, good-by to both of you.”\n\nWe had a windmill to repair that afternoon, some five miles from the\nranch, so that I did not return to the house until evening; but when\nall gathered around the supper table that night, Uncle Lance was\nthrowing bouquets at himself for the crafty manner in which he had\nswitched the padre from his mission, and yet sent him away delighted.\nHe admitted that he was scared on the appearance of Father Norquin as a\n_padrino_, on account of the fact that a priest was usually supreme\namong his own people. That he had early come to the conclusion if there\nwas to be any coercion used in this case, he was determined to get in\nhis bluff first. But Miss Jean ridiculed the idea that there was any\nserious danger.\n\n“Goodness me, Lance,” said she, “I could have told you there was no\ncause for alarm. In this case between Fidel and Juana, I’ve been a very\nliberal chaperon. Oh, well, now, never mind about the particulars.\nOnce, to try his nerve, I gave him a chance, and I happen to know the\nrascal kissed her the moment my back was turned. Oh, I think Juana will\nstay at Las Palomas.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\nWINTER AT LAS PALOMAS\n\n\nThe winter succeeding the drouth was an unusually mild one, frost and\nsleet being unseen at Las Palomas. After the holidays several warm\nrains fell, affording fine hunting and assuring enough moisture in the\nsoil to insure an early spring. The preceding winter had been gloomy,\nbut this proved to be the most social one since my advent, for within\nfifty miles of the ranch no less than two weddings occurred during\nChristmas week. As to little neighborhood happenings, we could hear of\nhalf a dozen every time we went to Shepherd’s after the mail.\n\nWhen the native help on the ranch was started at blocking out the stone\nfor the chapel, Uncle Lance took the hounds and with two of the boys\nwent down to Wilson’s ranch for a hunt. Gallup went, of course, but\njust why he took Scales along, unless with the design of making a match\nbetween one of the younger daughters of this neighboring ranchman and\nthe Marylander, was not entirely clear. When he wanted to, Scales could\nmake himself very agreeable, and had it not been for his profligate\ndisposition, his being taken along on the hunt would have been no\nmystery. Every one on the ranch, including the master and mistress,\nwere cognizant of the fact that for the past year he had maintained a\ncorrespondence with a girl in Florida—the one whose letter and\nphotograph had been found in the box of oranges. He hardly deserved the\nconfidence of the roguish girl, for he showed her letters to any one\nwho cared to read them. I had read every line of the whole\ncorrespondence, and it was plain that Scales had deceived the girl into\nbelieving that he was a prominent ranchman, when in reality the best\nthat could be said of him was that he was a lovable vagabond. From the\nlast letter, it was clear that he had promised to marry the girl during\nthe Christmas week just past, but he had asked for a postponement on\nthe ground that the drouth had prevented him from selling his beeves.\n\nWhen Uncle Lance made the discovery, during a cow hunt the fall before,\nof the correspondence between Scales and the Florida girl, he said to\nus around the camp-fire that night: “Well, all I’ve got to say is that\nthat girl down in Florida is hard up. Why, it’s entirely contrary to a\ngirl’s nature to want to be wooed by letter. Until the leopard changes\nhis spots, the good old way, of putting your arm around the girl and\nwhispering that you love her, will continue to be popular. If I was to\nhazard an opinion about that girl, Aaron, I’d say that she was\nambitious to rise above her surroundings. The chances are that she\nwants to get away from home, and possibly she’s as much displeased with\nthe young men in the orange country as I sometimes get with you\ndodrotted cow hands. Now, I’m not one of those people who’re always\nharping about the youth of his day and generation being so much better\nthan the present. That’s all humbug. But what does get me is, that you\nyoungsters don’t profit more by the experience of an old man like me\nwho’s been married three times. Line upon line and precept upon\nprecept, I have preached this thing to my boys for the last ten years,\nand what has it amounted to? Not a single white bride has ever been\nbrought to Las Palomas. They can call me a matchmaker if they want to,\nbut the evidence is to the contrary.” This was on the night after we\npassed Shepherd’s, where Scales had received a letter from the Florida\ngirl. But why he should accompany the hunt now to Remirena, unless the\nold ranchero proposed reforming him, was too deep a problem for me.\n\nOn leaving for Wilson’s, there was the usual bustle; hounds responding\nto the horn and horses under saddle champing their bits. I had hoped\nthat permission to go over to the Frio and San Miguel would be given\nJohn and myself, but my employer’s mind was too absorbed in something\nelse, and we were overlooked in the hurry to get away. Since the\nquarrying of the rock had commenced, my work had been overseeing the\nnative help, of which we had some fifteen cutting and hauling. In\nnumerous places within a mile of headquarters, a soft porous rock\ncropped out. By using a crowbar with a tempered chisel point, the\nMexicans easily channeled the rock into blocks, eighteen by thirty\ninches, splitting each stone a foot in thickness, so that when hauled\nto the place of use, each piece was ready to lay up in the wall. The\nranch house at headquarters was built out of this rock, and where\npermanency was required, it was the best material available, whitening\nand apparently becoming firmer with time and exposure.\n\nI had not seen my sweetheart in nearly a month, but there I was,\nchained to a rock quarry and mule teams. The very idea of Gallup and\nthe profligate Scales riding to hounds and basking in the society of\ncharming girls nettled me. The remainder of the ranch outfit was under\nDeweese, building the new corrals, so that I never heard my own tongue\nspoken except at meals and about the house. My orders included the\ncutting of a few hundred rock extra above the needs of the chapel, and\nwhen this got noised among the help, I had to explain that there was\nsome talk of building a stone cottage, and intimated that it was for\nJuana and Fidel. But that lucky rascal was one of the crew cutting\nrock, and from some source or other he had learned that I was liable to\nneed a cottage at Las Palomas in the near future. The fact that I was\nacting _segundo_ over the quarrying outfit, was taken advantage of by\nFidel to clear his skirts and charge the extra rock to my matrimonial\nexpectations. He was a fast workman, and on every stone he split from\nthe mother ledge, he sang out, “Otro piedra por Don Tomas!” And within\na few minutes’ time some one else would cry out, “Otro cillar por Fidel\ny Juana,” or “Otro piedra por padre Norquin.”\n\nA week passed and there was no return of the hunters. We had so\nsystematized our work at the quarry that my presence was hardly needed,\nso every evening I urged Cotton to sound the mistress for permission to\nvisit our sweethearts. John was a good-natured fellow who could be\neasily led or pushed forward, and I had come to look upon Miss Jean as\na ready supporter of any of her brother’s projects. For that reason her\npermission was as good as the master’s; but she parried all Cotton’s\nhints, pleading the neglect of our work in the absence of her brother.\nI was disgusted with the monotony of quarry work, and likewise was John\nover building corrals, as no cow hand ever enthuses over manual labor,\nwhen an incident occurred which afforded the opportunity desired. The\nmistress needed some small article from the store at Shepherd’s, and a\nMexican boy had been sent down on this errand and also to get the mail\nof the past two weeks. On the boy’s return, he brought a message from\nthe merchant, saying that Henry Annear had been accidentally killed by\na horse that day, and that the burial would take place at ten o’clock\nthe next morning.\n\nThe news threw the mistress of Las Palomas into a flutter. Her brother\nwas absent, and she felt a delicacy in consulting Deweese, and very\nnaturally turned to me for advice. Funerals in the Nueces valley were\nso very rare that I advised going, even if the unfortunate man had\nstood none too high in our estimation. Annear lived on the divide\nbetween Shepherd’s and the Frio at a ranch called Las Norias. As this\nranch was not over ten miles from the mouth of the San Miguel, the\nastute mind can readily see the gleam of my ax in attending. Funerals\nwere such events that I knew to a certainty that all the countryside\nwithin reach would attend, and the Vaux ranch was not over fifteen\nmiles distant from Las Norias. Acting on my advice, the mistress\nordered the ambulance to be ready to start by three o’clock the next\nmorning, and gave every one on the ranch who cared, permission to go\nalong. All of us took advantage of the offer, except Deweese, who, when\nout of hearing of the mistress, excused himself rather profanely.\n\nThe boy had returned late in the day, but we lost no time in acting on\nMiss Jean’s orders. Fortunately the ambulance teams were in hand\nhauling rock, but we rushed out several vaqueros to bring in the\n_remuda_ which contained our best saddle horses. It was after dark when\nthey returned with the mounts wanted, and warning Tiburcio that we\nwould call him at an early hour, every one retired for a few hours’\nrest. I would resent the charge that I am selfish or unsympathetic, yet\nbefore falling asleep that night the deplorable accident was entirely\noverlooked in the anticipated pleasure of seeing Esther.\n\nAs it was fully a thirty-five-mile drive we started at daybreak, and to\nencourage the mules Quayle and Happersett rode in the lead until\nsun-up, when they dropped to the rear with Cotton and myself. We did\nnot go by way of Shepherd’s, but crossed the river several miles above\nthe ferry, following an old cotton road made during the war, from the\ninterior of the state to Matamoras, Mexico. It was some time before the\nhour named for the burial when we sighted Las Norias on the divide, and\nspurred up the ambulance team, to reach the ranch in time for the\nfuneral. The services were conducted by a strange minister who happened\nto be visiting in Oakville, but what impressed me in particular was the\nsolicitude of Miss Jean for the widow. She had been frequently\nentertained at Las Palomas by its mistress, as the sweetheart of June\nDeweese, though since her marriage to Annear a decided coolness had\nexisted between the two women. But in the present hour of trouble, the\npast was forgotten and they mingled their tears like sisters.\n\nOn our return, which was to be by way of the Vauxes’, I joined those\nfrom the McLeod ranch, while Happersett and Cotton accompanied the\nambulance to the Vaux home. Nearly every one going our way was on\nhorseback, and when the cavalcade was some distance from Las Norias, my\nsweetheart dropped to the rear for a confidential chat and told me that\na lawyer from Corpus Christi, an old friend of the family, had come up\nfor the purpose of taking the preliminary steps for securing her\nfreedom, and that she expected to be relieved of the odious tie which\nbound her to Oxenford at the May term of court. This was pleasant news\nto me, for there would then be no reason for delaying our marriage.\n\nHappersett rode down to the San Miguel the next morning to inform\nQuayle and myself that the mistress was then on the way to spend the\nnight with the widow Annear, and that the rest of us were to report at\nhome the following evening. She had apparently inspected the lines on\nthe Frio, and, finding everything favorable, turned to other fields. I\nwas disappointed, for Esther and I had planned to go up to the Vaux\nranch during the visit. Dan suggested that we ride home together by way\nof the Vauxes’. But Quayle bitterly refused even to go near the ranch.\nHe felt very sore and revengeful over being jilted by Frances after she\nhad let him crown her Queen of the ball at the tournament dance. So,\nagreeing to meet on the divide the next day for the ride back to Las\nPalomas, we parted.\n\nThe next afternoon, on reaching the divide between the Frio and the\nhome river, Theodore and I scanned the horizon in vain for any\nhorsemen. We dismounted, and after waiting nearly an hour, descried two\nspecks to the northward which we knew must be our men. On coming up\nthey also threw themselves on the ground, and we indulged in a\ncigarette while we compared notes. I had nothing to conceal, and\nfrankly confessed that Esther and I expected to marry during the latter\npart of May. Cotton, though, seemed reticent, and though Theodore\ncross-questioned him rather severely, was non-committal and dumb as an\noyster; but before we recrossed the Nueces that evening, John and I\nhaving fallen far to the rear of the other two, he admitted to me that\nhis wedding would occur within a month after Lent. It was to be a\nconfidence between us, but I advised him to take Uncle Lance into the\nsecret at once.\n\nBut on reaching the ranch we learned that the hunting party had not\nreturned, nor had the mistress. The next morning we resumed our work,\nQuayle and Cotton at corral building and I at the rock quarry. The work\nhad progressed during my absence, and the number of pieces desired was\nnearing completion, and with but one team hauling the work-shop was\nalready congested with cut building stone. By noon the quarry was so\ncluttered with blocks that I ordered half the help to take axes and go\nto the encinal to cut dry oak wood for burning the lime. With the\nremainder of my outfit we cleaned out and sealed off the walls of an\nold lime kiln, which had served ever since the first rock buildings\nrose on Las Palomas. The oven was cut in the same porous formation, the\ninterior resembling an immense jug, possibly twelve feet in diameter\nand fifteen feet in height to the surface of the ledge. By locating the\nkiln near the abrupt wall of an abandoned quarry, ventilation was given\nfrom below by a connecting tunnel some twenty feet in length. Layers of\nwood and limestone were placed within until the interior was filled,\nwhen it was fired, and after burning for a few hours the draft was cut\noff below and above, and the heat retained until the limestone was\nproperly burned.\n\nNear the middle of the afternoon, the drivers hauling the blocks drove\nnear the kiln and shouted that the hunters had returned. Scaling off\nthe burnt rock in the interior and removing the debris made it late\nbefore our job was finished; then one of the vaqueros working on the\noutside told us that the ambulance had crossed the river over an hour\nbefore, and was then in the ranch. This was good news, and mounting our\nhorses we galloped into headquarters and found the corral outfit\nalready there. Miss Jean soon had our _segundo_ an unwilling prisoner\nin a corner, and from his impatient manner and her low tones it was\nplain to be seen that her two days’ visit with Mrs. Annear had resulted\nin some word for Deweese. Not wishing to intrude, I avoided them in\nsearch of my employer, finding him and Gallup at an outhouse holding a\nhound while Scales was taking a few stitches in an ugly cut which the\ndog had received from a _javeline_. Paying no attention to the two\nboys, I gave him the news, and bluntly informed him that Esther and I\nexpected to marry in May.\n\n“Bully for you, Tom,” said he. “Here, hold this fore foot, and look out\nhe don’t bite you. So she’ll get her divorce at the May term, and then\nall outdoors can’t stand in your way the next time. Now, that means\nthat you’ll have to get out fully two hundred more of those building\nrock, for your cottage will need three rooms. Take another stitch, knot\nyour thread well, and be quick about it. I tell you the _javeline_ were\npretty fierce; this is the fifth dog we’ve doctored since we returned.”\n\nOn freeing the poor hound, we both looked the pack over carefully, and\nas no others needed attention, Aaron and Glenn were excused. No sooner\nwere they out of hearing than I suggested that the order be made for\nfive hundred stone, as no doubt John Cotton would also need a cottage\nshortly after Lent. The old matchmaker beamed with smiles. “Is that\nright, Tom?” he inquired. “Of course, you boys tell each other what you\nwould hardly tell me. And so they have made the riffle at last? Why, of\ncourse they shall have a cottage, and have it so near that I can hear\nthe baby when it cries. Bully for tow-headed John. Oh, I reckon Las\nPalomas is coming to the front this year. Three new cottages and three\nnew brides is not to be sneezed at! Does your mistress know all this\ngood news?”\n\nI informed him that I had not seen Miss Jean to speak to since the\nfuneral, and that Cotton wished his intentions kept a secret. “Of\ncourse,” he said; “that’s just like a sap-headed youth, as if getting\nmarried was anything to be ashamed of. Why, when I was the age of you\nboys I’d have felt proud over the fact. Wants it kept a secret, does\nhe? Well, I’ll tell everybody I meet, and I’ll send word to the ferry\nand to every ranch within a hundred miles, that our John Cotton and\nFrank Vaux are going to get married in the spring. There’s nothing\ndisgraceful in matrimony, and I’ll publish this so wide that neither of\nthem will dare back out. I’ve had my eye on that girl for years, and\nnow when there’s a prospect of her becoming the wife of one of my boys,\nhe wants it kept a secret? Well, I don’t think it’ll keep.”\n\nAfter that I felt more comfortable over my own confession. Before we\nwere called to supper every one in the house, including the Mexicans\nabout headquarters, knew that Cotton and I were soon to be married. And\nall during the evening the same subject was revived at every lull in\nthe conversation, though Deweese kept constantly intruding the corral\nbuilding and making inquiries after the hunt. “What difference does it\nmake if we hunted or not?” replied Uncle Lance to his foreman with some\nlittle feeling. “Suppose we did only hunt every third or fourth day?\nThose Wilson folks have a way of entertaining friends which makes\nriding after hounds seem commonplace. Why, the girls had Glenn and\nAaron on the go until old man Nate and myself could hardly get them out\non a hunt at all. And when they did, provided the girls were along,\nthey managed to get separated, and along about dusk they’d come\nslouching in by pairs, looking as innocent as turtle-doves. Not that\nthose Wilson girls can’t ride, for I never saw a better horsewoman than\nSusie—the one who took such a shine to Scales.”\n\nI noticed Miss Jean cast a reproving glance at her brother on his\nconnecting the name of Susie Wilson with that of his vagabond employee.\nThe mistress was a puritan in morals. That Scales fell far below her\nideal there was no doubt, and the brother knew too well not to differ\nwith her on this subject. When all the boys had retired except Cotton\nand me, the brother and sister became frank with each other.\n\n“Well, now, you must not blame me if Miss Susie was attentive to\nAaron,” said the old matchmaker, in conciliation, pacing the room. “He\nwas from Las Palomas and their guest, and I see no harm in the girls\nbeing courteous and polite. Susie was just as nice as pie to me, and I\nhope you don’t think I don’t entertain the highest regard for Nate\nWilson’s family. Suppose one of the girls did smile a little too much\non Aaron, was that my fault? Now, mind you, I never said a word one way\nor the other, but I’ll bet every cow on Las Palomas that Aaron Scales,\nvagabond that he is, can get Susie Wilson for the asking. I know your\nstandard of morals, but you must make allowance for others who look\nupon things differently from you and me. You remember Katharine Vedder\nwho married Carey Troup at the close of the war. There’s a similar case\nfor you. Katharine married Troup just because he was so wicked, at\nleast that was the reason she gave, and she and you were old\nrun-togethers. And you remember too that getting married was the\nturning-point in Carey Troup’s life. Who knows but Aaron might sober\ndown if he was to marry? Just because a man has sown a few wild oats in\nhis youth, does that condemn him for all time? You want to be more\nliberal. Give me the man who has stood the fire tests of life in\npreference to one who has never been tempted.”\n\n“Now, Lance, you know you had a motive in taking Aaron down to\nWilson’s,” said the sister, reprovingly. “Don’t get the idea that I\ncan’t read you like an open book. Your argument is as good as an\nadmission of your object in going to Ramirena. Ever since Scales got up\nthat flirtation with Suzanne Vaux last summer, it was easy to see that\nAaron was a favorite with you. Why don’t you take Happersett around and\nintroduce him to some nice girls? Honest, Lance, I wouldn’t give poor\nold Dan for the big beef corral full of rascals like Scales. Look how\nhe trifled with that silly girl in Florida.”\n\nInstead of continuing the argument, the wily ranchero changed the\nsubject.\n\n“The trouble with Dan is he’s too old. When a fellow begins to get a\nlittle gray around the edges, he gets so foxy that you couldn’t bait\nhim into a matrimonial trap with sweet grapes. But, Sis, what’s the\nmatter with your keeping an eye open for a girl for Dan, if he’s such a\nfavorite with you? If I had half the interest in him that you profess,\nI certainly wouldn’t ask any one to help. It wouldn’t surprise me if\nthe boys take to marrying freely after John and Tom bring their brides\nto Las Palomas. Now that Mrs. Annear is a widow, there’s the same old\nchance for June. If Glenn don’t make the riffle with Miss Jule, he\nought to be shot on general principles. And I don’t know, little\nsister, if you and I were both to oppose it, that we could prevent that\nrascal of an Aaron from marrying into the Wilson family. You have no\nidea what a case Susie and Scales scared up during our ten days’ hunt.\nThat only leaves Dan and Theodore. But what’s the use of counting the\nchickens so soon? You go to bed, for I’m going to send to the Mission\nto-morrow after the masons. There’s no use in my turning in, for I\nwon’t sleep a wink to-night, thinking all this over.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\nAN INDIAN SCARE\n\n\nNear the close of January, ’79, the Nueces valley was stirred by an\nIndian scare. I had a distinct recollection of two similar scares in my\nboyhood on the San Antonio River, in which I never caught a glimpse of\nthe noble red man. But whether the rumors were groundless or not, Las\nPalomas set her house in order. The worst thing we had to fear was the\nloss of our saddle stock, as they were gentle and could be easily run\noff and corralled on the range by stretching lariats. At this time the\nranch had some ten _remudas_ including nearly five hundred saddle\nhorses, some of them ranging ten or fifteen miles from the ranch, and\non receipt of the first rumor, every _remuda_ was brought in home and\nput under a general herd, night and day.\n\n“These Indian scares,” said Uncle Lance, “are just about as regular as\ndrouths. When I first settled here, the Indians hunted up and down this\nvalley every few years, but they never molested anything. Why, I got\nwell acquainted with several bucks, and used to swap rawhide with them\nfor buckskin. Game was so abundant then that there was no temptation to\nkill cattle or steal horses. But the rascals seem to be getting worse\never since. The last scare was just ten years ago next month, and kept\nus all guessing. The renegades were Kickapoos and came down the Frio\nfrom out west. One Sunday morning they surprised two of Waugh’s\nvaqueros while the latter were dressing a wild hog which they had\nkilled. The Mexicans had only one horse and one gun between them. One\nof them took the horse and the other took the carbine. Not daring to\nfollow the one with the gun for fear of ambuscade, the Indians gave\nchase to the vaquero on horseback, whom they easily captured. After\nstripping him of all his clothing, they tied his hands with thongs, and\npinned the poor devil to a tree with spear thrusts through the back.\n\n“The other Mexican made his escape in the chaparral, and got back to\nthe ranch. As it happened, there was only a man or two at Waugh’s place\nat the time, and no attempt was made to follow the Indians, who, after\nkilling the vaquero, went on west to Altita Creek—the one which puts\ninto the Nueces from the north, just about twenty miles above the\nGanso. Waugh had a sheep camp on the head of Altito, and there the\nKickapoos killed two of his _pastors_ and robbed the camp. From that\ncreek on westward, their course was marked with murders and horse\nstealing, but the country was so sparsely settled that little or no\nresistance could be offered, and the redskins escaped without\npunishment. At that time they were armed with bow and arrow and spears,\nbut I have it on good authority that all these western tribes now have\nfirearms. The very name of Indians scares women and children, and if\nthey should come down this river, we must keep in the open and avoid\nambush, as that is an Indian’s forte.”\n\nAll the women and children at the outlying ranchitas were brought into\nheadquarters, the men being left to look after the houses and their\nstock and flocks. In the interim, Father Norquin and the masons had\narrived and the chapel was daily taking shape. But the rumors of the\nIndian raid thickened. Reports came in of shepherds shot with their\nflocks over near Espontos Lake and along the Leona River, and Las\nPalomas took on the air of an armed camp. Though we never ceased to\nride the range wherever duty called, we went always in squads of four\nor five.\n\nThe first abatement of the scare took place when one evening a\ncavalcade of Texas Rangers reached our ranch from DeWitt County. They\nconsisted of fifteen mounted men under Lieutenant Frank Barr, with a\ncommissary of four pack mules. The detachment was from one of the crack\ncompanies of the state, and had with them several half-blood trailers,\nthough every man in the squad was more or less of an expert in that\nline. They were traveling light, and had covered over a hundred miles\nduring the day and a half preceding their arrival at headquarters. The\nhospitality of Las Palomas was theirs to command, and as their most\nurgent need was mounts, they were made welcome to the pick of every\nhorse under herd. Sunrise saw our ranger guests on their way, leaving\nthe high tension relaxed and every one on the ranch breathing easier.\nBut the Indian scare did not prove an ill wind to the plans of Father\nNorquin. With the concentration of people from the ranchitas and those\nbelonging at the home ranch, the chapel building went on by leaps and\nbounds. A native carpenter had been secured from Santa Maria, and the\nenthusiastic padre, laying aside his vestments, worked with his hands\nas a common laborer. The energy with which he inspired the natives made\nhim a valuable overseer. From assisting the carpenter in hewing the\nrafters, to advising the masons in laying a keystone, or with his own\nhands mixing the mortar and tamping the earth to give firm foundation\nto the cement floor, he was the directing spirit. Very little lumber\nwas used in the construction of buildings at Las Palomas. The houses\nwere thatched with a coarse salt grass, called by the natives\n_zacahuiste_. Every year in the overflowed portions of the valley,\ngreat quantities of this material were cut by the native help and\nstored against its need. The grass sometimes grew two feet in height,\nand at cutting was wrapped tightly and tied in “hands” about two inches\nin diameter. For fastening to the roofing lath, green blades of the\nSpanish dagger were used, which, after being roasted over a fire to\ntoughen the fibre, were split into thongs and bound the hands securely\nin a solid mass, layer upon layer like shingles. Crude as it may\nappear, this was a most serviceable roof, being both rain proof and\nimpervious to heat, while, owing to its compactness, a live coal of\nfire laid upon it would smoulder but not ignite.\n\nNo sooner had the masons finished the plastering of the inner walls and\ncementing the floor, than they began on a two-roomed cottage. As its\nwhite walls arose conjecture was rife as to who was to occupy it. I\nmade no bones of the fact that I expected to occupy a _jacal_ in the\nnear future, but denied that this was to be mine, as I had been\npromised one with three rooms. Out of hearing of our employer, John\nCotton also religiously denied that the tiny house was for his use.\nFidel, however, took the chaffing without a denial, the padre and Uncle\nLance being his two worst tormentors.\n\nDuring the previous visit of the padre, when the chapel was decided on,\nthe order for the finishing material for the building had been placed\nwith the merchant at Shepherd’s, and was brought up from Corpus Christi\nthrough his freighters. We now had notice from the merchant that his\nteamsters had returned, and two four-mule teams went down to the ferry\nfor the lumber, glassware, sash and doors. Miss Jean had been\nimportuning the padre daily to know when the dedication would take\nplace, as she was planning to invite the countryside.\n\n“Ah, my daughter,” replied the priest, “we must learn to cultivate\npatience. All things that abide are of slow but steady growth, and my\nwork is for eternity. Therefore I must be an earnest servant, so that\nwhen my life’s duty ends, it can be said in truth, ‘Well done, thou\ngood and faithful servant.’ But I am as anxious to consecrate this\nbuilding to the Master’s service as any one. My good woman, if I only\nhad a few parishioners like you, we would work wonders among these\nnatives.”\n\nOn the return of the mule teams, the completion of the building could\nbe determined, and the padre announced the twenty-first of February as\nthe date of dedication. On reaching this decision, the ranch was set in\norder for an occasion of more than ordinary moment. Fidel and Juana\nwere impatient to be married, and the master and mistress had decided\nthat the ceremony should be performed the day after the dedication, and\nall the guests of the ranch should remain for the festivities. The\npadre, still in command, dispatched a vaquero to the Mission,\nannouncing the completion of the chapel, and asking for a brother\npriest to bring out certain vestments and assist in the dedicatory\nexercises. The Indian scare was subsiding, and as no word had come from\nthe rangers confidence grew that the worst was over, so we scattered in\nevery direction inviting guests. From the Booths on the Frio to the\nWilsons of Ramirena, and along the home river as far as Lagarto, our\nfriends were bidden in the name of the master and mistress of Las\nPalomas.\n\nOn my return from taking the invitations to the ranches north, the\nchapel was just receiving the finishing touches. The cross crowning the\nfront glistened in fresh paint, while on the interior walls shone cheap\nlithographs of the Madonna and Christ. The old padre, proud and jealous\nas a bridegroom over his bride, directed the young friar here and\nthere, himself standing aloof and studying with an artist’s eye every\neffect in color and drapery. The only discordant note in the interior\nwas the rough benches, in the building of which Father Norquin himself\nhad worked, thus following, as he repeatedly admonished us, in the\nfootsteps of his Master, the carpenter of Galilee.\n\nThe ceremony of dedication was to be followed by mass at high noon. Don\nMateo Gonzales of Santa Maria sent his regrets, as did likewise Don\nAlejandro Travino of the Mission, but the other invited guests came\nearly and stayed late. The women and children of the outlying ranchitas\nhad not yet returned to their homes, and with our invited guests made\nan assembly of nearly a hundred and fifty persons. Unexpectedly, and\nwithin two hours of the appointed time for the service to commence, a\ncavalcade was sighted approaching the ranch from the west. As they\nturned in towards headquarters, some one recognized the horses, and a\nshout of welcome greeted our ranger guests of over two weeks before.\nUncle Lance met them as if they had been expected, and invited the\nlieutenant and his men to dismount and remain a few days as guests of\nLas Palomas. When they urged the importance of continuing on their\njourney to report to the governor, the host replied:—\n\n“Lieutenant Barr, that don’t go here. Fall out of your saddles and\nborrow all the razors and white shirts on the ranch, for we need you\nfor the dedication of a chapel to-day, and for a wedding and infare for\nto-morrow. We don’t see you along this river as often as we’d like to,\nand when you do happen along in time for a peaceful duty, you can’t get\naway so easily. If you have any special report to make to your\nsuperiors, why, write her out, and I’ll send a vaquero with it to\nOakville this afternoon, and it’ll go north on the stage to-morrow.\nBut, lieutenant, you mustn’t think you can ride right past Las Palomas\nwhen you’re not under emergency orders. Now, fall off those horses and\nspruce up a little, for I intend to introduce you to some as nice girls\nas you ever met. You may want to quit rangering some day, and I may\nneed a man about your size, and I’m getting tired of single ones.”\n\nLieutenant Barr surrendered. Saddles were stripped from horses, packs\nwere unlashed from mules, and every animal was sent to our _remudas_\nunder herd. The accoutrements were stacked inside the gate like\nhaycocks, with slickers thrown over them; the carbines were thrown on\nthe gallery, and from every nail, peg, or hook on the wall belts and\nsix-shooters hung in groups. These rangers were just ordinary looking\nmen, and might have been mistaken for an outfit of cow hands. In age\nthey ranged from a smiling youth of twenty to grizzled men of forty,\nyet in every countenance was written a resolute determination. All the\nrazors on the ranch were brought into immediate use, while every\npresentable shirt, collar, and tie in the house was unearthed and\nplaced at their disposal. While arranging hasty toilets, the men\ninformed us that when they reached Espontos Lake the redskins had left,\nand that they had trailed them south until the Indians had crossed the\nRio Grande into Mexico several days in advance of their arrival. The\nusual number of isolated sheepherders killed, and of horses stolen,\nwere the features of the raid.\n\nThe guests had been arriving all morning. The Booths had reached the\nranch the night before, and the last to put in an appearance was the\ncontingent from the Frio and San Miguel. Before the appearance of the\nrangers, they had been sighted across the river, and they rode up with\nPierre Vaux, like a captain of the Old Guard, in the lead.\n\n“Ah, Don Lance,” he cried, “vat you tink? Dey say Don Pierre no ride\nfas’ goin’ to church. Dese youngsters laff all time and say I never get\nhere unless de dogs is ’long. Sacré! Act all time lak I vas von ol’\nman. _Humbre_, keep away from dis horse; he allow nobody but me to lay\nvon han’ on him—keep away, I tol’ you!”\n\nI helped the girls to dismount, Miss Jean kissing them right and left,\nand bustling them off into the house to tidy up as fast as possible;\nfor the hour was almost at hand. On catching sight of Mrs. Annear,\nfresh and charming in her widow’s weeds, Uncle Lance brushed Don Pierre\naside and cordially greeted her. Vaqueros took the horses, and as I\nstrolled up the pathway with Esther, I noticed an upper window full of\nranger faces peering down on the girls. Before this last contingent had\nhad time to spruce up, Pasquale’s eldest boy rode around all the\n_jacals_, ringing a small handbell to summon the population to the\ndedication. Outside of our home crowd, we had forty white guests, not\nincluding the two Booth children and the priests. As fast as the\nrangers were made presentable, the master and mistress introduced them\nto all the girls present. Of course, there were a few who could not be\nenticed near a woman, but Quayle and Happersett, like kindred spirits,\ntook the backward ones under their wing, and the procession started for\nthe chapel.\n\nThe audience was typical of the Texas frontier at the close of the\n’70’s. Two priests of European birth conducted the services. Pioneer\ncowmen of various nationalities and their families intermingled and\noccupied central seats. By the side of his host, a veteran of ’36, when\nMexican rule was driven from the land, sat Lieutenant Barr, then\nengaged in accomplishing a second redemption of the state from crime\nand lawlessless. Lovable and esteemed men were present, who had\nfollowed the fortunes of war until the Southern flag, to which they had\nrallied, went down in defeat. The younger generation of men were\nstalwart in physique, while the girls were modest in their rustic\nbeauty. Sitting on the cement floor on three sides of us were the\nnatives of the ranch, civilized but with little improvement over their\nAztec ancestors.\n\nThe dedicatory exercises were brief and simple. Every one was invited\nto remain for the celebration of the first mass in the newly\nconsecrated building. Many who were not communicants accepted, but\nnoticing the mistress and my sweetheart taking their leave, I joined\nthem and assisted in arranging the tables so that all our guests could\nbe seated at two sittings. At the conclusion of the services, dinner\nwas waiting, and Father Norquin and Mr. Nate Wilson were asked to carve\nat one table, while the young friar and Lieutenant Barr, in a similar\ncapacity, officiated at the other. There was so much volunteer help in\nthe kitchen that I was soon excused, and joined the younger people on\nthe gallery. As to whom Cotton and Gallup were monopolizing there was\nno doubt, but I had a curiosity to notice what Scales would do when\nplaced between two fires. But not for nothing had he cultivated the\nacquaintance of a sandy-mustached young ranger, who was at that moment\nentertaining Suzanne Vaux in an alcove at the farther end of the\nveranda. Aaron, when returning from the chapel with Susie Wilson, had\nsucceeded in getting no nearer the house than a clump of oak trees\nwhich sheltered an old rustic settee. And when the young folks were\ncalled in to dinner, the vagabond Scales and Miss Wilson of Ramirena\nhad to be called the second time.\n\nIn seating the younger generation, Miss Jean showed her finesse. Nearly\nall the rangers had dined at the first tables, but the widow Annear\nwaited for the second one—why, only a privileged few of us could guess.\nArtfully and with seeming unconsciousness on the part of every one,\nDeweese was placed beside the charming widow, though I had a suspicion\nthat June was the only innocent party in the company. Captain Byler and\nI were carving at the same table at which our foreman and the widow\nwere seated, and, being in the secret, I noted step by step the\nprogress of the widow, and the signs of gradual surrender of the\ncorporal _segundo_. I had a distinct recollection of having once\nsmashed some earnest resolves, and of having capitulated under similar\ncircumstances, and now being happily in love, I secretly wished success\nto the little god Cupid in the case in hand. And all during the\nafternoon and evening, it was clearly apparent to any one who cared to\nnotice that success was very likely.\n\nThe evening was a memorable one at Las Palomas. Never before in my\nknowledge had the ranch had so many and such amiable guests. The\nrangers took kindly to our hospitality, and Father Norquin waddled\nabout, God-blessing every one, old and young, frivolous and sedate.\nOwing to the nature of the services of the day, the evening was spent\nin conversation among the elders, while the younger element promenaded\nthe spacious gallery, or occupied alcoves, nooks, and corners about the\ngrounds. On retiring for the night, the men yielded the house to the\nwomen guests, sleeping on the upper and lower verandas, while the\nranger contingent, scorning beds or shelter, unrolled their blankets\nunder the spreading live-oaks in the yard.\n\nBut the real interest centred in the marriage of Fidel and Juana, which\ntook place at six o’clock the following evening. Every one, including\nthe native element, repaired to the new chapel to attend the wedding.\nUncle Lance and his sister had rivaled each other as to whether man or\nmaid should have the better outfit. Fidel was physically far above the\naverage of the natives, slightly bow-legged, stolid, and the coolest\nperson in the church. The bride was in quite a flutter, but having been\ncoached and rehearsed daily by her mistress, managed to get through the\nordeal. The young priest performed the ceremony, using his own native\ntongue, the rich, silvery accents of Spanish. At the conclusion of the\nservice, every one congratulated the happy couple, the women and girls\nin tears, the sterner sex without demonstration of feeling. When we\nwere outside the chapel, and waiting for our sweethearts to dry their\ntears and join us, Uncle Lance came swaggering’ over to John Cotton and\nme, and, slapping us both on the back, said:—\n\n“Boys, that rascal of a Fidel has a splendid nerve. Did you notice how\nhe faced the guns without a tremor; never batted an eye but took his\nmedicine like a little man. I hope both of you boys will show equally\ngood nerve when your turn comes. Why, I doubt if there was a ranger in\nthe whole squad, unless it was that red-headed rascal who kissed the\nbride, who would have stood the test like that vaquero—without a\nshiver. And it’s something you can’t get used to. Now, as you all know,\nI’ve been married three times. The first two times I was as cool as\nmost, but the third whirl I trembled all over. Quavers ran through me,\nmy tongue was palsied, my teeth chattered, my knees knocked together,\nand I felt like a man that was sent for and couldn’t go. Now, mind you,\nit was the third time and I was only forty-five.”\n\nWhat a night that was! The contents of the warehouse had been shifted,\nnative musicians had come up from Santa Maria, and every one about the\nhome ranch who could strum a guitar was pressed into service. The\nstoreroom was given over to the natives, and after honoring the\noccasion with their presence as patrons, the master and mistress, after\nthe opening dance, withdrew in company with their guests. The night had\nthen barely commenced. Claiming two guitarists, we soon had our guests\nwaltzing on veranda, hall, and spacious dining-room to the music of my\nfiddle. Several of the rangers could play, and by taking turns every\none had a joyous time, including the two priests. Among the Mexicans\nthe dancing continued until daybreak. Shortly after midnight our guests\nretired, and the next morning found all, including the priests,\npreparing to take their departure. As was customary, we rode a short\ndistance with our guests, bidding them again to Las Palomas and\nreceiving similar invitations in return. With the exception of Captain\nByler, the rangers were the last to take their leave. When the mules\nwere packed and their mounts saddled, the old ranchero extended them a\nwelcome whenever they came that way again.\n\n“Well, now, Mr. Lovelace,” said Lieutenant Barr, “you had better not\npress that invitation too far. The good time we have had with you\ndiscounts rangering for the State of Texas. Rest assured, sir, that we\nwill not soon forget the hospitality of Las Palomas, nor its ability to\nentertain. Push on with the packs, boys, and I’ll take leave of the\nmistress in behalf of you all, and overtake the squad before it reaches\nthe river.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\nHORSE BRANDS\n\n\nBefore gathering the fillies and mares that spring, and while riding\nthe range, locating our horse stock, Pasquale brought in word late one\nevening that a _ladino_ stallion had killed the regular one, and was\nthen in possession of the _manada_. The fight between the outlaw and\nthe ranch stallion had evidently occurred above the mouth of the Ganso\nand several miles to the north of the home river, for he had\naccidentally found the carcass of the dead horse at a small lake and,\nrecognizing the animal by his color, had immediately scoured the\ncountry in search of the band. He had finally located the _manada_,\nmany miles off their range; but at sight of the vaquero the _ladino_\nusurper had deserted the mares, halting, however, out of gunshot, yet\nfollowing at a safe distance as Pasquale drifted them back. Leaving the\n_manada_ on their former range, Pasquale had ridden into the ranch and\nreported. It was then too late in the day to start against the\ninterloper, as the range was fully twenty-five miles away, and we were\ndelayed the next morning in getting up speedy saddle horses from\ndistant and various _remudas_, and did not get away from the ranch\nuntil after dinner. But then we started, taking the usual pack mules,\nand provisioned for a week’s outing.\n\nIncluded in the party was Captain Frank Byler, the regular home crowd,\nand three Mexicans. With an extra saddle horse for each, we rode away\nmerrily to declare war on the _ladino_ stallion. “This is the third\ntime since I’ve been ranching here,” said Uncle Lance to Captain Frank,\nas we rode along, “that I’ve had stallions killed. There always have\nbeen bands of wild horses, west here between the Leona and Nueces\nrivers and around Espontos Lake. Now that country is settling up, the\npeople walk down the bands and the stallions escape, and in drifting\nabout find our range. They’re wiry rascals, and our old stallions don’t\nstand any more show with them than a fat hog would with a _javaline_.\nThat’s why I take as much pride in killing one as I do a rattlesnake.”\n\nWe made camp early that evening on the home river, opposite the range\nof the _manada_. Sending out Pasquale to locate the band and watch them\nuntil dark, Uncle Lance outlined his idea of circling the band and\nbagging the outlaw in the uncertain light of dawn. Pasquale reported on\nhis return after dark that the _manada_ were contentedly feeding on\ntheir accustomed range within three miles of camp. Pasquale had watched\nthe band for an hour, and described the _ladino_ stallion as a\ncinnamon-colored coyote, splendidly proportioned and unusually large\nfor a mustang.\n\nNaturally, in expectation of the coming sport, the horses became the\ntopic around the camp-fire that night. Every man present was a born\nhorseman, and there was a generous rivalry for the honor in telling\nhorse stories. Aaron Scales joined the group at a fortunate time to\nintroduce an incident from his own experience, and, raking out a coal\nof fire for his pipe, began:—\n\n“The first ranch I ever worked on,” said he, “was located on the\nNavidad in Lavaca County. It was quite a new country then, rather\nbroken and timbered in places and full of bear and wolves. Our outfit\nwas working some cattle before the general round-up in the spring. We\nwanted to move one brand to another range as soon as the grass would\npermit, and we were gathering them for that purpose. We had some ninety\nsaddle horses with us to do the work,—sufficient to mount fifteen men.\nOne night we camped in a favorite spot, and as we had no cattle to hold\nthat night, all the horses were thrown loose, with the usual precaution\nof hobbling, except two or three on picket. All but about ten head wore\nthe bracelets, and those ten were pals, their pardners wearing the\nhemp. Early in the evening, probably nine o’clock, with a bright fire\nburning, and the boys spreading down their beds for the night, suddenly\nthe horses were heard running, and the next moment they hobbled into\ncamp like a school of porpoise, trampling over the beds and crowding up\nto the fire and the wagon. They almost knocked down some of the boys,\nso sudden was their entrance. Then they set up a terrible nickering for\nmates. The boys went amongst them, and horses that were timid and shy\nalmost caressed their riders, trembling in limb and muscle the while\nthrough fear, like a leaf. We concluded a bear had scented the camp,\nand in approaching it had circled round, and run amuck our saddle\nhorses. Every horse by instinct is afraid of a bear, but more\nparticularly a range-raised one. It’s the same instinct that makes it\nimpossible to ride or drive a range-raised horse over a rattlesnake.\nWell, after the boys had petted their mounts and quieted their fears,\nthey were still reluctant to leave camp, but stood around for several\nhours, evidently feeling more secure in our presence. Now and then one\nof the free ones would graze out a little distance, cautiously sniff\nthe air, then trot back to the others. We built up a big fire to scare\naway any bear or wolves that might he in the vicinity, but the horses\nstayed like invited guests, perfectly contented as long as we would pet\nthem and talk to them. Some of the boys crawled under the wagon, hoping\nto get a little sleep, rather than spread their bed where a horse could\nstampede over it. Near midnight we took ropes and saddle blankets and\ndrove them several hundred yards from camp. The rest of the night we\nslept with one eye open, expecting every moment to hear them take\nfright and return. They didn’t, but at daylight every horse was within\nfive hundred yards of the wagon, and when we unhobbled them and broke\ncamp that morning, we had to throw riders in the lead to hold them\nback.”\n\nOn the conclusion of Scales’s experience, there was no lack of\nvolunteers to take up the thread, though an unwritten law forbade\ninterruptions. Our employer was among the group, and out of deference\nto our guest, the boys remained silent. Uncle Lance finally regaled us\nwith an account of a fight between range stallions which he had once\nwitnessed, and on its conclusion Theodore Quayle took his turn.\n\n“The man I was working for once moved nearly a thousand head of mixed\nrange stock, of which about three hundred were young mules, from the\nSan Saba to the Concho River. It was a dry country and we were\ncompelled to follow the McKavett and Fort Chadbourne trail. We had\ntimed our drives so that we reached creeks once a day at least,\nsometimes oftener. It was the latter part of summer, and was unusually\nhot and drouthy. There was one drive of twenty-five miles ahead that\nthe owner knew of without water, and we had planned this drive so as to\nreach it at noon, drive halfway, make a dry camp over night, and reach\nthe pools by noon the next day. Imagine our chagrin on reaching the\nwatering place to find the stream dry. We lost several hours riding up\nand down the _arroyo_ in the hope of finding relief for the men, if not\nfor the stock. It had been dusty for weeks. The cook had a little water\nin his keg, but only enough for drinking purposes. It was twenty miles\nyet to the Concho, and make it before night we must. Turning back was\nfarther than going ahead, and the afternoon was fearfully hot. The heat\nwaves looked like a sea of fire. The first part of the afternoon drive\nwas a gradual ascent for fifteen miles, and then came a narrow plateau\nof a divide. As we reached this mesa, a sorrier-looking lot of men,\nhorses, and mules can hardly be imagined. We had already traveled over\nforty miles without water for the stock, and five more lay between us\nand the coveted river.\n\n“The heat was oppressive to the men, but the herd suffered most from\nthe fine alkali dust which enveloped them. Their eyebrows and nostrils\nwere whitened with this fine powder, while all colors merged into one.\nOn reaching this divide, we could see the cotton-woods that outlined\nthe stream ahead. Before we had fully crossed this watershed and begun\nthe descent, the mules would trot along beside the riders in the lead,\neven permitting us to lay our hands on their backs. It was getting late\nin the day before the first friendly breeze of the afternoon blew\nsoftly in our faces. Then, Great Scott! what a change came over man and\nherd. The mules in front threw up their heads and broke into a grand\nchorus. Those that were strung out took up the refrain and trotted\nforward. The horses set up a rival concert in a higher key. They had\nscented the water five miles off.\n\n“All hands except one man on each side now rode in the lead. Every once\nin a while, some enthusiastic mule would break through the line of\nhorsemen, and would have to be brought back. Every time we came to an\nelevation where we could catch the breeze, the grand horse and mule\nconcert would break out anew. At the last elevation between us and the\nwater, several mules broke through, and before they could be brought\nback the whole herd had broken into a run which was impossible to\ncheck. We opened out then and let them go.\n\n“The Concho was barely running, but had long, deep pools here and\nthere, into which horses and mules plunged, dropped down, rolled over,\nand then got up to nicker and bray. The young mules did everything but\ndrink, while the horses were crazy with delight. When the wagon came up\nwe went into camp and left them to play out their hands. There was no\nherding to do that night, as the water would hold them as readily as a\nhundred men.”\n\n“Well, I’m going to hunt my blankets,” said Uncle Lance, rising. “You\nunderstand, Captain, that you are to sleep with me to-night. Davy\nCrockett once said that the politest man he ever met in Washington\nsimply set out the decanter and glasses, and then walked over and\nlooked out of the window while he took a drink. Now I want to be\nequally polite and don’t want to hurry you to sleep, but whenever you\nget tired of yarning, you’ll find the bed with me in it to the windward\nof that live-oak tree top over yonder.”\n\nCaptain Frank showed no inclination to accept the invitation just then,\nbut assured his host that he would join him later. An hour or two\npassed by.\n\n“Haven’t you fellows gone to bed yet?” came an inquiry from out of a\nfallen tree top beyond the fire in a voice which we all recognized.\n“All right, boys, sit up all night and tell fool stories if you want\nto. But remember, I’ll have the last rascal of you in the saddle an\nhour before daybreak. I have little sympathy for a man who won’t sleep\nwhen he has a good chance. So if you don’t turn in at all it will be\nall right, but you’ll be routed out at three in the morning, and the\nman who requires a second calling will get a bucket of water in his\nface.”\n\nCaptain Frank and several of us rose expecting to take the hint of our\nemployer, when our good intentions were arrested by a query from Dan\nHappersett, “Did any of you ever walk down a wild horse?” None of us\nhad, and we turned back and reseated ourselves in the group.\n\n“I had a little whirl of it once when I was a youngster,” said Dan,\n“except we didn’t walk. It was well known that there were several bands\nof wild horses ranging in the southwest corner of Tom Green County.\nThose who had seen them described one band as numbering forty to fifty\nhead with a fine chestnut stallion as a leader. Their range was well\nlocated when water was plentiful, but during certain months of the year\nthe shallow lagoons where they watered dried up, and they were\ncompelled to leave. It was when they were forced to go to other waters\nthat glimpses of them were to be had, and then only at a distance of\none or two miles. There was an outfit made up one spring to go out to\ntheir range and walk these horses down. This season of the year was\nselected, as the lagoons would be full of water and the horses would be\nnaturally reduced in flesh and strength after the winter, as well as\nweak and thin blooded from their first taste of grass. We took along\ntwo wagons, one loaded with grain for our mounts. These saddle horses\nhad been eating grain for months before we started and their flesh was\nfirm and solid.\n\n“We headed for the lagoons, which were known to a few of our party, and\nwhen we came within ten miles of the water holes, we saw fresh signs of\na band—places where they had apparently grazed within a week. But it\nwas the second day before we caught sight of the wild horses, and too\nlate in the day to give them chase. They were watering at a large lake\nsouth of our camp, and we did not disturb them. We watched them until\nnightfall, and that night we planned to give them chase at daybreak.\nFour of us were to do the riding by turns, and imaginary stations were\nallotted to the four quarters of our camp. If they refused to leave\ntheir range and circled, we could send them at least a hundred and\nfifty miles the first day, ourselves riding possibly a hundred, and\nthis riding would be divided among four horses, with plenty of fresh\nones at camp for a change.\n\n“Being the lightest rider in the party, it was decided that I was to\ngive them the first chase. We had a crafty plainsman for our captain,\nand long before daylight he and I rode out and waited for the first\npeep of day. Before the sun had risen, we sighted the wild herd within\na mile of the place where darkness had settled over them the night\nprevious. With a few parting instructions from our captain, I rode\nleisurely between them and the lake where they had watered the evening\nbefore. At first sight of me they took fright and ran to a slight\nelevation. There they halted a moment, craning their necks and sniffing\nthe air. This was my first fair view of the chestnut stallion. He\nrefused to break into a gallop, and even stopped before the rest,\nturning defiantly on this intruder of his domain. From the course I was\nriding, every moment I was expecting them to catch the wind of me.\nSuddenly they scented me, knew me for an enemy, and with the stallion\nin the lead they were off to the south.\n\n“It was an exciting ride that morning. Without a halt they ran twenty\nmiles to the south, then turned to the left and there halted on an\nelevation; but a shot in the air told them that all was not well and\nthey moved on. For an hour and a half they kept their course to the\neast, and at last turned to the north. This was, as we had calculated,\nabout their range. In another hour at the farthest, a new rider with a\nfresh horse would take up the running. My horse was still fresh and\nenjoying the chase, when on a swell of the plain I made out the rider\nwho was to relieve me; and though it was early yet in the day the\nmustangs had covered sixty miles to my forty. When I saw my relief\nlocate the band, I turned and rode leisurely to camp. When the last two\nriders came into camp that night, they reported having left the herd at\na new lake, to which the mustang had led them, some fifteen miles from\nour camp to the westward.\n\n“Each day for the following week was a repetition of the first with\nvarying incident. But each day it was plain to be seen that they were\nfagging fast. Toward the evening of the eighth day, the rider dared not\ncrowd them for fear of their splitting into small bands, a thing to be\navoided. On the ninth day two riders took them at a time, pushing them\nunmercifully but preventing them from splitting, and in the evening of\nthis day they could be turned at the will of the riders. It was then\nagreed that after a half day’s chase on the morrow, they could be\nhandled with ease. By noon next day, we had driven them within a mile\nof our camp.\n\n“They were tired out and we turned them into an impromptu corral made\nof wagons and ropes. All but the chestnut stallion. At the last he\nescaped us; he stopped on a little knoll and took a farewell look at\nhis band.\n\n“There were four old United States cavalry horses among our captive\nband of mustangs, gray with age and worthless—no telling where they\ncame from. We clamped a mule shoe over the pasterns of the younger\nhorses, tied toggles to the others, and the next morning set out on our\nreturn to the settlements.”\n\nUnder his promise the old ranchero had the camp astir over an hour\nbefore dawn. Horses were brought in from picket ropes, and divided into\ntwo squads, Pasquale leading off to the windward of where the band was\nlocated at dusk previous. The rest of the men followed Uncle Lance to\ncomplete the leeward side of the circle. The location of the _manada_,\nhad been described as between a small hill covered with Spanish bayonet\non one hand, and a _zacahuiste_ flat nearly a mile distant on the\nother, both well-known landmarks. As we rode out and approached the\nlocation, we dropped a man every half mile until the hill and adjoining\nsalt flat had been surrounded. We had divided what rifles the ranch\nowned between the two squads, so that each side of the circle was armed\nwith four guns. I had a carbine, and had been stationed about midway of\nthe leeward half-circle. At the first sign of dawn, the signal agreed\nupon, a turkey call, sounded back down the line, and we advanced. The\ncircle was fully two miles in diameter, and on receiving the signal I\nrode slowly forward, halting at every sound. It was a cloudy morning\nand dawn came late for clear vision. Several times I dismounted and in\napproaching objects at a distance drove my horse before me, only to\nfind that, as light increased, I was mistaken.\n\n\n[Illustration: UTTERING A SINGLE PIERCING SNORT]\n\n\nWhen both the flat and the dagger crowned hill came into view, not a\nliving object was in sight. I had made the calculation that, had the\n_manada_ grazed during the night, we should be far to the leeward of\nthe band, for it was reasonable to expect that they would feed against\nthe wind. But there was also the possibility that the outlaw might have\nherded the band several miles distant during the night, and while I was\nmeditating on this theory, a shot rang out about a mile distant and\nbehind the hill. Giving my horse the rowel, I rode in the direction of\nthe report; but before I reached the hill the _manada_ tore around it,\nalmost running into me. The coyote mustang was leading the band; but as\nI halted for a shot, he turned inward, and, the mares intervening, cut\noff my opportunity. But the warning shot had reached every rider on the\ncircle, and as I plied rowel and quirt to turn the band, Tio Tiburcio\ncut in before me and headed them backward. As the band whirled away\nfrom us the stallion forged to the front and, by biting and a free use\nof his heels, attempted to turn the _manada_ on their former course.\nBut it mattered little which way they turned now, for our cordon was\nclosing round them, the windward line then being less than a mile\ndistant.\n\nAs the band struck the eastward or windward line of horsemen, the\nmares, except for the control of the stallion, would have yielded, but\nnow, under his leadership, they recoiled like a band of _ladinos_. But\nevery time they approached the line of the closing circle they were\nchecked, and as the cordon closed to less than half a mile in diameter,\nin spite of the outlaw’s lashings, the _manada_ quieted down and\nhalted. Then we unslung our carbines and rifles and slowly closed in\nupon the quarry. Several times the mustang stallion came to the\noutskirts of the band, uttering a single piercing snort, but never\nexposed himself for a shot. Little by little as we edged in he grew\nimpatient, and finally trotted out boldly as if determined to forsake\nhis harem and rush the line. But the moment he cleared the band Uncle\nLance dismounted, and as he knelt the stallion stopped like a statue,\ngave a single challenging snort, which was answered by a rifle report,\nand he fell in his tracks.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\nSHADOWS\n\n\nSpring was now at hand after an unusually mild winter. With the\nbreaking of the drouth of the summer before there had sprung up all\nthrough the encinal and sandy lands an immense crop of weeds, called by\nthe natives _margoso_, fallow-weed. This plant had thriven all winter,\nand the cattle had forsaken the best mesquite grazing in the river\nbottoms to forage on it. The results showed that their instinct was\ntrue; for with very rare exceptions every beef on the ranch was fit for\nthe butcher’s block. Truly it was a year of fatness succeeding a lean\none. Never during my acquaintance with Las Palomas had I seen the\ncattle come through a winter in such splendid condition. But now there\nwas no market. Faint rumors reached us of trail herds being put up in\nnear-by counties, and it was known that several large ranches in Nueces\nCounty were going to try the experiment of sending their own cattle up\nthe trail. Lack of demand was discouraging to most ranchmen, and our\nrange was glutted with heavy steer cattle.\n\nThe first spring work of any importance was gathering the horses to\nfill a contract we had with Captain Byler. Previous to the herd which\nDeweese had sold and delivered at Fort Worth the year before, our horse\nstock had amounted to about four thousand head. With the present sale\nthe ranch holdings would be much reduced, and it was our intention to\nretain all _manadas_ used in the breeding of mules. When we commenced\ngathering we worked over every one of our sixty odd bands, cutting out\nall the fillies and barren mares. In disposing of whole _manadas_ we\nkept only the geldings and yearlings, throwing in the old stallions for\ngood measure, as they would be worthless to us when separated from\ntheir harems. In less than a week’s time we had made up the herd, and\nas they were all in the straight ‘horse hoof’ we did not road-brand\nthem. While gathering them we put them under day and night herd,\nthrowing in five _remudas_ as we had agreed, but keeping back the bell\nmares, as they were gentle and would be useful in forming new bands of\nsaddle horses. The day before the appointed time for the delivery, the\ndrover brought up saddle horses and enough picked mares to make his\nherd number fifteen hundred.\n\nThe only unpleasant episode of the sale was a difference between\nTheodore Quayle and my employer. Quayle had cultivated the friendship\nof the drover until the latter had partially promised him a job with\nthe herd, in case there was no objection. But when Uncle Lance learned\nthat Theodore expected to accompany the horses, he took Captain Frank\nto task for attempting to entice away his men. The drover entered a\nstrong disclaimer, maintaining that he had promised Quayle a place only\nin case it was satisfactory to all concerned; further, that in trail\nwork with horses he preferred Mexican vaqueros, and had only made the\nconditional promise as a favor to the young man. Uncle Lance accepted\nthe explanation and apologized to the drover, but fell on Theodore\nQuayle and cruelly upbraided him for forsaking the ranch without cause\nor reason. Theodore was speechless with humiliation, but no sooner were\nthe hasty words spoken than my employer saw that he had grievously hurt\nanother’s feelings, and humbly craved Quayle’s pardon.\n\nThe incident passed and was apparently forgotten. The herd started\nnorth on the trail on the twenty-fifth of March, Quayle stayed on at\nLas Palomas, and we resumed our regular spring work on the ranch. While\ngathering the mares and fillies, we had cut out all the geldings four\nyears old and upward to the number of nearly two hundred, and now our\nusual routine of horse breaking commenced. The masons had completed\ntheir work on all three of the cottages and returned to the Mission,\nbut the carpenter yet remained to finish up the woodwork. Fidel and\nJuana had begun housekeeping in their little home, and the cosy warmth\nwhich radiated from it made me impatient to see my cottage finished.\nThrough the mistress, arrangements had been made for the front rooms in\nboth John’s cottage and mine to be floored instead of cemented.\n\nSome two weeks before Easter Sunday, Cotton returned from the Frio,\nwhere he had been making a call on his intended. Uncle Lance at once\nquestioned him to know if they had set the day, and was informed that\nthe marriage would occur within ten days after Lent, and that he\nexpected first to make a hurried trip to San Antonio for a wedding\noutfit.\n\n“That’s all right, John,” said the old ranchero approvingly, “and I\nexpect Quirk might as well go with you. You can both draw every cent\ndue you, and take your time, as wages will go right on the same as if\nyou were working. There will not be much to do except the usual horse\nbreaking and a little repairing about the ranch. It’s quite likely I\nshan’t be able to spare Tom in the early summer, for if no cattle\nbuyers come along soon, I’m going to send June to the coast and let him\nsniff around for one. I’d like the best in the world to sell about\nthree thousand beeves, and we never had fatter ones than we have\nto-day. If we can make a sale, it’ll keep us busy all the fore part of\nthe summer. So both you fellows knock off any day you want to and go up\nto the city. And go horseback, for this ranch don’t give Bethel &\nOxenford’s stages any more of its money.”\n\nWith this encouragement, we decided to start for the city the next\nmorning. But that evening I concluded to give a certain roan gelding a\nfinal ride before turning him over to the vaqueros. He was a vicious\nrascal, and after trying a hundred manoeuvres to unhorse me, reared and\nfell backward, and before I could free my foot from the stirrup, caught\nmy left ankle, fracturing several of the small bones in the joint. That\nsettled my going anywhere on horseback for a month, as the next morning\nI could not touch my foot to the ground. John did not like to go alone,\nand the mistress insisted that Theodore was well entitled to a\nvacation. The master consented, each was paid the wages due him, and\ncatching up their own private horses, the old cronies started off to\nSan Antonio. They expected to make Mr. Booth’s ranch in a little over\nhalf a day, and from there a sixty-mile ride would put them in the\ncity.\n\nAfter the departure of the boys the dull routine of ranch work went\nheavily forward. The horse breaking continued, vaqueros rode the range\nlooking after the calf crop, while I had to content myself with nursing\na crippled foot and hobbling about on crutches. Had I been able to ride\na horse, it is quite possible that a ranch on the San Miguel would have\nhad me as its guest; but I must needs content myself with lying around\nthe house, visiting with Juana, or watching the carpenter finishing the\ncottages. I tried several times to interest my mistress in a scheme to\ninvite my sweetheart over for a week or two, but she put me off on one\npretext and another until I was vexed at her lack of enthusiasm. But\ntruth compels me to do that good woman justice, and I am now satisfied\nthat my vexation was due to my own peevishness over my condition and\nnot to neglect on her part. And just then she was taking such an\nabsorbing interest in June and the widow, and likewise so sisterly a\nconcern for Dan Happersett, that it was little wonder she could give me\nno special attention when I was soon to be married. It was the bird in\nthe bush that charmed Miss Jean.\n\nTowards the close of March a number of showers fell, and we had a week\nof damp, cloudy weather. This was unfortunate, as it called nearly\nevery man from the horse breaking to ride the range and look after the\nyoung calves. One of the worst enemies of a newly born calf is screw\nworms, which flourish in wet weather, and prove fatal unless removed;\nfor no young calf withstands the pest over a few days. Clear dry\nweather was the best preventive against screw worms, but until the\npresent damp spell abated every man in the ranch was in the saddle from\nsunrise to sunset.\n\nIn the midst of this emergency work a beef buyer by the name of Wayne\nOrahood reached the ranch. He was representing the lessees of a\nsteamship company plying between New Orleans and Texas coast points.\nThe merchant at the ferry had advised Orahood to visit Las Palomas, but\non his arrival about noon there was not a white man on the ranch to\nshow him the cattle. I knew the anxiety of my employer to dispose of\nhis matured beeves, and as the buyer was impatient there was nothing to\ndo but get up horses and ride the range with him. Miss Jean was anxious\nto have the stock shown, and in spite of my lameness I ordered saddle\nhorses for both of us. Unable to wear a boot and still hobbling on\ncrutches, I managed to Indian mount an old horse, my left foot still\ntoo inflamed to rest in the stirrup. From the ranch we rode for the\nencinal ridges and sandy lands to the southeast, where the fallow-weed\nstill throve in rank profusion, and where our heaviest steers were\nliable to range. By riding far from the watering points we encountered\nthe older cattle, and within an hour after leaving the ranch I was\nshowing some of the largest beeves on Las Palomas.\n\nHow that beef buyer did ride! Scarcely giving the cattle a passing\nlook, he kept me leading the way from place to place where our salable\nstock was to be encountered. Avoiding the ranchitos and wells, where\nthe cows and younger cattle were to be found, we circled the extreme\noutskirts of our range, only occasionally halting, and then but for a\nsingle glance over some prime beeves. We turned westward from the\nencinal at a gallop, passing about midway between Santa Maria and the\nhome ranch. Thence we pushed on for the hills around the head of the\nGanso. Not once in the entire ride did we encounter any one but a\nMexican vaquero, and there was no relief for my foot in meeting him!\nSeveral times I had an inclination to ask Mr. Orahood to remember my\nsore ankle, and on striking the broken country I suggested we ride\nslower, as many of our oldest beeves ranged through these hills. This\nsuggestion enabled me to ease up and to show our best cattle to\nadvantage until the sun set. We were then twenty-five miles from the\nranch. But neither distance nor approaching darkness checked Wayne\nOrahood’s enthusiasm. A dozen times he remarked, “We’ll look at a few\nmore cattle, son, and then ride in home.” We did finally turn homeward,\nand at a leisurely gait, but not until it was too dark to see cattle,\nand it was several hours after darkness when we sighted the lamps at\nheadquarters, and finished the last lap in our afternoon’s sixty-mile\nride.\n\nMy employer and Mr. Orahood had met before, and greeted each other with\na rugged cordiality common among cowmen. The others had eaten their\nsupper; but while the buyer and I satisfied the inner man, Uncle Lance\nsat with us at the table and sparred with Orahood in repartee, or asked\nregarding mutual friends, artfully avoiding any mention of cattle. But\nafter we had finished Mr. Orahood spoke of his mission, admitted\ndeprecatingly that he had taken a little ride south and west that\nafternoon, and if it was not too much trouble he would like to look\nover our beeves on the north of the Nueces in the morning. He showed no\nenthusiasm, but acknowledged that he was buying for shipment, and\nthought that another month’s good grass ought to put our steers in fair\ncondition. I noticed Uncle Lance clouding up over the buyer’s lack of\nappreciation, but he controlled himself, and when Mr. Orahood expressed\na wish to retire, my employer said to his guest, as with candle in hand\nthe two stood in parting:—\n\n“Well, now, Wayne, that’s too bad about the cattle being so thin. I’ve\nbeen working my horse stock lately, and didn’t get any chance to ride\nthe range until this wet spell. But since the screw worms got so bad,\nbeing short-handed, I had to get out and rustle myself or we’d lost a\nlot of calves. Of course, I have noticed a steer now and then, and have\nbeen sorry to find them so spring-poor. Actually, Wayne, if we were\nexpecting company, we’d have to send to the ferry and get a piece of\nbacon, as I haven’t seen a hoof fit to kill. That roast beef which you\nhad for supper—well, that was sent us by a neighbor who has fat cows.\nAbout a year ago now, water was awful scarce with us, and a few old\ncows died up and down this valley. I suppose you didn’t hear of it,\nliving so far away. Heretofore, every time we had a drouth there was\nsuch a volunteer growth of fallow-weed that the cattle got mud fat\nfollowing every dry spell. Still I’ll show you a few cattle among the\nguajio brush and sand hills on the divide in the morning and see what\nyou think of them. But of course, if they lack flesh, in case you are\nbuying for shipment I shan’t expect you to bid on them.”\n\nThe old ranchero and the buyer rode away early the next morning, and\ndid not return until near the middle of the afternoon, having already\nagreed on a sale. I was asked to write in duplicate the terms and\nconditions. In substance, Las Palomas ranch agreed to deliver at\nRockport on the coast, on the twentieth of May, and for each of the\nfollowing three months, twelve hundred and fifty beeves, four years old\nand upward. The consideration was $27.50 per head, payable on delivery.\nI knew my employer had oversold his holdings, but there would be no\ntrouble in making up the five thousand head, as all our neighbors would\ngladly turn in cattle to fill the contract. The buyer was working on\ncommission, and the larger the quantity he could contract for, the\nbetter he was suited. After the agreement had been signed in duplicate,\nMr. Orahood smilingly admitted that ours were the best beeves he had\nbought that spring. “I knew it,” said Uncle Lance; “you don’t suppose\nI’ve been ranching in this valley over forty years without knowing a\nfat steer when I see one. Tom, send a _muchacho_ after a bundle of\nmint. Wayne, you haven’t got a lick of sense in riding—I’m as tired as\na dog.”\n\nThe buyer returned to Shepherd’s the next morning. The horse breaking\nwas almost completed, except allotting them into _remudas_, assigning\nbell mares, and putting each band under herd for a week or ten days.\nThe weather was fairing off, relieving the strain of riding the range,\nand the ranch once more relaxed into its languid existence. By a\npeculiar coincidence, Easter Sunday occurred on April the 13th that\nyear, it being also the sixty-sixth birthday of the ranchero. Miss Jean\nusually gave a little home dinner on her brother’s birthday, and had\nplanned one for this occasion, which was but a few days distant. In the\nmail which had been sent for on Saturday before Easter, a letter had\ncome from John Cotton to his employer, saying he would start home in a\nfew days, and wanted Father Norquin sent for, as the wedding would take\nplace on the nineteenth of the month. He also mentioned the fact that\nTheodore expected to spend a day or two with the Booths returning, but\nhe would ride directly down to the Vaux ranch, and possibly the two\nwould reach home about the same time.\n\nI doubt if Uncle Lance ever enjoyed a happier birthday than this one.\nThere was every reason why he should enjoy it. For a man of his age,\nhis years rested lightly. The ranch had never been more prosperous.\nEven the drouth of the year before had not proved an ill wind; for the\ndamage then sustained had been made up by conditions resulting in one\nof the largest sales of cattle in the history of the ranch. A chapel\nand three new cottages had been built without loss of time and at very\nlittle expense. A number of children had been born to the soil, while\nthe natives were as loyal to their master as subjects in the days of\nfeudalism. There was but one thing lacking to fill the cup to\noverflowing—the ranchero was childless. Possessed with a love of the\nland so deep as to be almost his religion, he felt the need of an heir.\n\n“Birthdays to a man of my years,” said Uncle Lance, over Easter dinner,\n“are food for reflection. When one nears the limit of his allotted\ndays, and looks back over his career, there is little that satisfies.\nFinancial success is a poor equivalent for other things. But here I am\npreaching when I ought to be rejoicing. Some one get John’s letter and\nread it again. Let’s see, the nineteenth falls on Saturday. Lucky day\nfor Las Palomas! Well, we’ll have the padre here, and if he says\nbarbecue a beef, down goes the fattest one on the ranch. This is the\nyear in which we expect to press our luck. I begin to feel it in my old\nbones that the turning-point has come. When Father Norquin arrives, I\nthink I’ll have him preach us a sermon on the evils of single life. But\nthen it’s hardly necessary, for most of you boys have got your eye on\nsome girl right now. Well, hasten the day, every rascal of you, and\nyou’ll find a cottage ready at a month’s notice.”\n\nThe morning following Easter opened bright and clear, while on every\nhand were the signs of spring. A vaquero was dispatched to the Mission\nto summon the padre, carrying both a letter and the compliments of the\nranch. Among the jobs outlined for the week was the repairing of a\nwell, the walls of which had caved in, choking a valuable water supply\nwith débris. This morning Deweese took a few men and went to the well,\nto raise the piping and make the necessary repairs, curbing being the\nmost important. But while the foreman and Santiago Ortez were standing\non a temporary platform some thirty feet down, a sudden and unexpected\ncave-in occurred above them. Deweese saw the danger, called to his\ncompanion, and, in a flash laid hold of a rope with which materials\nwere being lowered. The foreman’s warning to his companion reached the\nhelpers above, and Deweese was hastily windlassed to the surface, but\nthe unfortunate vaquero was caught by the falling debris, he and the\nplatform being carried down into the water beneath. The body of Ortez\nwas recovered late that evening, a coffin was made during the night,\nand the next morning the unfortunate man was laid in his narrow home.\n\nThe accident threw a gloom over the ranch. Yet no one dreamt that a\nsecond disaster was at hand. But the middle of the week passed without\nthe return of either of the absent boys. Foul play began to be\nsuspected, and meanwhile Father Norquin arrived, fully expecting to\nsolemnize within a few days the marriage of one of the missing men.\nAaron Scales was dispatched to the Vaux ranch, and returned the next\nmorning by daybreak with the information that neither Quayle nor Cotton\nhad been seen on the Frio recently. A vaquero was sent to the Booth\nranch, who brought back the intelligence that neither of the missing\nboys had been seen since they passed northward some two weeks before.\nFather Norquin, as deeply affected as any one, returned to the Mission,\nunable to offer a word of consolation. Several days passed without\ntidings. As the days lengthened into a week, the master, as deeply\nmortified over the incident as if the two had been his own sons, let\nhis suspicion fall on Quayle. And at last when light was thrown on the\nmystery, the old ranchero’s intuition proved correct.\n\nMy injured foot improved slowly, and before I was able to resume my\nduties on the ranch, I rode over one day to the San Miguel for a short\nvisit. Tony Hunter had been down to Oakville a few days before my\narrival, and while there had met Clint Dansdale, who was well\nacquainted with Quayle and Cotton. Clint, it appeared, had been in San\nAntonio and met our missing men, and the three had spent a week in the\ncity chumming together. As Dansdale was also on horseback, the trio\nagreed to start home the same time, traveling in company until their\nways separated. Cotton had told Dansdale what business had brought him\nto the city, and received the latter’s congratulations. The boys had\ndecided to leave for home on the ninth, and on the morning of the day\nset forth, moneyless but rich in trinkets and toggery. But some where\nabout forty miles south of San Antonio they met a trail herd of cattle\nfrom the Aransas River. Some trouble had occurred between the foreman\nand his men the day before, and that morning several of the latter had\ntaken French leave. On meeting the travelers, the trail boss, being\nshort-handed, had offered all three of them a berth. Quayle had\naccepted without a question. The other two had stayed all night with\nthe herd, Dansdale attempting to dissuade Cotton, and Quayle, on the\nother hand, persuading him to go with the cattle. In the end Quayle’s\npersuasions won. Dansdale admitted that the opportunity appealed\nstrongly to him, but he refused the trail foreman’s blandishments and\nreturned to his ranch, while the two Las Palomas lads accompanied the\nherd, neither one knowing or caring where they were going.\n\nWhen I returned home and reported this to my employer, he was visibly\naffected. “So that explains all,” said he, “and my surmises regarding\nTheodore were correct. I have no particular right to charge him with\ningratitude, and yet this ranch was as much his home as mine. He had\nthe same to eat, drink, and wear as I had, with none of the concern,\nand yet he deserted me. I never spoke harshly to him but once, and now\nI wish I had let him go with Captain Byler. That would have saved me\nCotton and the present disgrace to Las Palomas. I ought to have known\nthat a good honest boy like John would be putty in the hands of a\nfellow like Theodore. But it’s just like a fool boy to throw away his\nchances in life. They still sell their birthright for a mess of\npottage. And there stands the empty cottage to remind me that I have\nsomething to learn. Old as I am, my temper will sometimes get away from\nme. Tom, you are my next hope, and I am almost afraid some unseen\nobstacle will arise as this one did. Does Frances know the facts?” I\nanswered that Hunter had kept the facts to himself, not even\nacquainting his own people with them, so that aside from myself he was\nthe first to know the particulars. After pacing the room for a time in\nmeditation, Uncle Lance finally halted and asked me if Scales would be\na capable messenger to carry the news to the Vaux family. I admitted\nthat he was the most tactful man on the ranch. Aaron was summoned,\ngiven the particulars, and commanded to use the best diplomacy at his\ncommand in transmitting the facts, and to withhold nothing; to express\nto the ranchman and his family the deep humiliation every one at Las\nPalomas felt over the actions of John Cotton.\n\nYears afterward I met Quayle at a trail town in the north. In the\nlimited time at our command, the old days we spent together in the\nNueces valley occupied most of our conversation. Unmentioned by me, his\ndesertion of Las Palomas was introduced by himself, and in attempting\nto apologize for his actions, he said:—\n\n“Quirk, that was the only dirty act I was ever guilty of. I never want\nto meet the people the trick was practiced on. Leaving Las Palomas was\nas much my privilege as going there was. But I was unfortunate enough\nto incur a few debts while living there that nothing but personal\nrevenge could ever repay. Had it been any other man than Lance\nLovelace, he or I would have died the morning Captain Byler’s horse\nherd started from the Nueces River. But he was an old man, and my hand\nwas held and my tongue was silent. You know the tricks of a certain\ngirl who, with her foot on my neck, stretched forth a welcoming hand to\na rival. Tom, I have lived to pay her my last obligation in a revenge\nso sweet that if I die an outcast on the roadside, all accounts are\nsquare.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\nINTERLOCUTORY PROCEEDINGS\n\n\nA big summer’s work lay before us. When Uncle Lance realized the\npermanent loss of three men from the working force of Las Palomas, he\nrallied to the situation. The ranch would have to run a double outfit\nthe greater portion of the summer, and men would have to be secured to\nfill our ranks. White men who were willing to isolate themselves on a\nfrontier ranch were scarce; but the natives, when properly treated,\nwere serviceable and, where bred to the occupation and inclined to\ndomesticity, made ideal vaqueros. My injured foot improved slowly, and\nas soon as I was able to ride, it fell to me to secure the extra help\nneeded. The desertion of Quayle and Cotton had shaken my employer’s\nconfidence to a noticeable degree, and in giving me my orders to secure\nvaqueros, he said:—\n\n“Tom, you take a good horse and go down the Tarancalous and engage five\nvaqueros. Satisfy yourself that the men are fit for the work, and hire\nevery one by the year. If any of them are in debt, a hundred dollars is\nmy limit of advance money to free them. And hire no man who has not a\nfamily, for I’m losing confidence every minute in single ones,\nespecially if they are white. We have a few empty _jacals_, and the\nmore children that I see running naked about the ranch, the better it\nsuits me. I’ll never get my money back in building that Cotton cottage\nuntil I see a mother, even though she is a Mexican, standing in the\ndoor with a baby in her arms. The older I get, the more I see my\nmistake in depending on the white element.”\n\nI was gone some three days in securing the needed help. It was a\ndelicate errand, for no ranchero liked to see people leave his lands,\nand it was only where I found men unemployed that I applied for and\nsecured them. We sent wagons from Las Palomas after their few effects,\nand had all the families contentedly housed, either about headquarters\nor at the outlying ranchitas, before the first contingent of beeves was\ngathered. But the attempt to induce any of the new families to occupy\nthe stone cottage proved futile, as they were superstitious. There was\na belief among the natives, which no persuasion could remove, regarding\nhouses that were built for others and never occupied. The new building\nwas tendered to Tio Tiburcio and his wife, instead of their own\npalisaded _jacal_, but it remained tenantless—an eyesore to its\nbuilder.\n\nNear the latter end of April, a contract was let for two new tanks on\nthe Ganso grant of land. Had it not been for the sale of beef, which\nwould require our time the greater portion of the summer, it was my\nemployer’s intention to have built these reservoirs with the ranch\nhelp. But with the amount of work we had in sight, it was decided to\nlet the contract to parties who made it their business and were\noutfitted for the purpose. Accordingly in company with the contractor,\nUncle Lance and myself spent the last few days of the month laying off\nand planning the reservoir sites on two small tributaries which formed\nthe Ganso. We were planning to locate these tanks several miles above\nthe juncture of the small rivulets, and as far apart as possible. Then\nthe first rainfall which would make running water, would assure us a\nyear’s supply on the extreme southwestern portion of our range. The\ncontractor had a big outfit of oxen and mules, and the conditions\ncalled for one of the reservoirs to be completed before June 15th.\nThus, if rains fell when they were expected, one receptacle at least\nwould be in readiness.\n\nWhen returning one evening from starting the work, we found Tony Hunter\na guest of the ranch. He had come over for the special purpose of\nseeing me, but as the matter was not entirely under my control, my\nemployer was brought into the consultation. In the docket for the May\nterm of court, the divorce proceedings between Esther and Jack Oxenford\nwould come up for a hearing at Oakville on the seventh of the month.\nHunter was anxious, if possible, to have all his friends present at the\ntrial. But dates were getting a little close, for our first contingent\nof beeves was due on the coast on the twentieth, and to gather and\ndrive them would require not less than ten days. A cross-bill had been\nfiled by Oxenford’s attorney at the last hour, and a fight was going to\nbe made to prevent the decree from issuing. The judge was a hold-over\nfrom the reconstruction régime, having secured his appointment through\nthe influence of congressional friends, one of whom was the uncle of\nthe junior stage man. Unless the statutory grounds were clear, there\nwas a doubt expressed by Esther’s attorney whether the court would\ngrant the decree. But that was the least of Hunter’s fears, for in his\neyes the man who would willfully abuse a woman had no rights, in court\nor out. Tony, however, had enemies; for he and Oxenford had had a\npersonal altercation, and since the separation the Martin family had\ntaken the side of Jack’s employer and severed all connections with the\nranch. That the mail contractors had the village of Oakville under\ntheir control, all agreed, as we had tested that on our return from\nFort Worth the spring before. In all the circumstances, though Hunter\nhad no misgivings as to the ultimate result, yet being a witness and\naccused of being the main instigator in the case, he felt that he\nought, as a matter of precaution, to have a friend or two with him.\n\n“Well, now, Tony,” said my employer, “this is crowding the mourners\njust a trifle, but Las Palomas was never called on in a good cause but\nshe could lend a man or two, even if they had to get up from the dinner\ntable and go hungry. I don’t suppose the trial will last over a day or\ntwo at the furthest, and even if it did, the boys could ride home in\nthe night. In our first bunch and in half a day, we’ll gather every\nbeef in two rodeos and start that evening. Steamships won’t wait, and\nif we were a day behind time, they might want to hold out demurrage on\nus. If it wasn’t for that, the boys could stay a week and you would be\nwelcome to them. Of course, Tom will want to go, and about the next\nbest man I could suggest would be June. I’d like the best in the world\nto go myself, but you see how I’m situated, getting these cattle off\nand a new tank building at the same time. Now, you boys make your own\narrangements among yourselves, and this ranch stands ready to back up\nanything you say or do.”\n\nTony remained overnight, and we made arrangements to meet him, either\nat Shepherd’s the evening before or in Oakville on the morning of the\ntrial. Owing to the behavior of Quayle and Cotton, none of us had\nattended the celebration of San Jacinto Day at the ferry. Nor had any\none from the Vaux or McLeod ranches, for while they did not understand\nthe situation, it was obvious that something was wrong, and they had\nremained away as did Las Palomas. But several of Hunter’s friends from\nthe San Miguel had been present, as likewise had Oxenford, and reports\ncame back to the ranch of the latter’s conduct and of certain threats\nhe had made when he found there was no one present to resent them. The\nnext morning, before starting home, Tony said to our _segundo_ and\nmyself;—\n\n“Then I’ll depend on you two, and I may have a few other friends who\nwill want to attend. I don’t need very many for a coward like Jack\nOxenford. He is perfectly capable of abusing an unprotected woman, or\nan old man if he had a crowd of friends behind to sick him on. Oh, he’s\na cur all right; for when I told him that he was whelped under a house,\nhe never resented it. He loves me all right, or has good cause to. Why,\nI bent the cylinder pin of a new six-shooter over his head when he had\na gun on him, and he forgot to use it. I don’t expect any trouble, but\nif you don’t look a sneaking cur right in the eye, he may slip up\nbehind and bite you.”\n\nAfter making arrangements to turn in two hundred beeves on our second\ncontingent, and send a man with them to the coast, Hunter returned\nhome. There was no special programme for the interim until gathering\nthe beeves commenced, yet on a big ranch like Las Palomas there is\nalways work. While Deweese finished curbing the well in which Ortez\nlost his life, I sawed off and cut new threads on all the rods and\npiping belonging to that particular windmill. With a tireless energy\nfor one of his years, Uncle Lance rode the range, until he could have\ntold at a distance one half his holdings of cattle by flesh marks\nalone. A few days before the date set for the trial, Enrique brought in\nword one evening that an outfit of strange men were encamped north of\nthe river on the Ganso Tract. The vaquero was unable to make out their\nbusiness, but was satisfied they were not there for pleasure, so my\nemployer and I made an early start the next morning to see who the\ncampers were. On the extreme northwestern corner of our range, fully\ntwenty-five miles from headquarters, we met them and found they were a\ncorps of engineers, running a preliminary survey for a railroad. They\nwere in the employ of the International and Great Northern Company,\nwhich was then contemplating extending their line to some point on the\nRio Grande. While there was nothing definite in this prior survey, it\nsounded a note of warning; for the course they were running would carry\nthe line up the Ganso on the south side of the river, passing between\nthe new tanks, and leaving our range through a sag in the hills on the\nsouth end of the grant. The engineer in charge very courteously\ninformed my employer that he was under instructions to run, from San\nAntonio to different points on the river, three separate lines during\nthe present summer. He also informed us that the other two preliminary\nsurveys would be run farther west, and there was a possibility that the\nLas Palomas lands would be missed entirely, a prospect that was very\ngratifying to Uncle Lance.\n\n“Tom,” said he, as we rode away, “I’ve been dreading this very thing\nfor years. It was my wish that I would never live to see the necessity\nof fencing our lands, and to-day a railroad survey is being run across\nLas Palomas. I had hoped that when I died, this valley would be an open\nrange and as primitive as the day of my coming to it. Here a railroad\nthreatens our peace, and the signs are on every hand that we’ll have to\nfence to protect ourselves. But let it come, for we can’t stop it. If\nI’m spared, within the next year, I’ll secure every tract of land for\nsale adjoining the ranch if it costs me a dollar an acre. Then if it\ncomes to the pinch, Las Palomas will have, for all time, land and to\nspare. You haven’t noticed the changes in the country, but nearly all\nthis chaparral has grown up, and the timber is twice as heavy along the\nriver as when I first settled here. I hate the sight even of a\nnecessity like a windmill, and God knows we have no need of a railroad.\nTo a ranch that doesn’t sell fat beeves over once in ten years,\ntransportation is the least of its troubles.”\n\nAbout dusk on the evening of the day preceding the trial, June Deweese\nand I rode into Shepherd’s, expecting to remain overnight. Shortly\nafter our arrival, Tony Hunter hastily came in and informed us that he\nhad been unable to get hotel accommodations for his wife and Esther in\nOakville, and had it not been that they had old friends in the village,\nall of them would have had to return to the ferry for the night. These\nfriends of the McLeod family told Hunter that the stage people had\ncoerced the two hotels into refusing them, and had otherwise prejudiced\nthe community in Oxenford’s favor. Hunter had learned also that the\njunior member of the stage firm had collected a crowd of hangers-on,\nand being liberal in the use of money, had convinced the rabble of the\nvillage that he was an innocent and injured party. The attorney for\nEsther had arrived, and had cautioned every one interested on their\nside of the case to be reserved and careful under every circumstance,\nas they had a bitter fight on their hands.\n\nThe next morning all three of us rode into the village. Court had been\nin session over a week, and the sheriff had sworn in several deputies\nto preserve the peace, as there was considerable bitterness between\nlitigants outside the divorce case. These under-sheriffs made it a\npoint to see that every one put aside his arms on reaching the town,\nand tried as far as lay in their power to maintain the peace. During\nthe early days of the reconstruction regime, before opening the term\nthe presiding judge had frequently called on the state for a company of\nTexas Rangers to preserve order and enforce the mandates of the court.\nBut in ’79 there seemed little occasion for such a display of force,\nand a few fearless officers were considered sufficient. On reaching the\nvillage, we rode to the house where the women were awaiting us.\nFortunately there was ample corral room at the stable, so we were\nindependent of hostelries and liveries. Mrs. Hunter was the very\nreverse of her husband, being a timid woman, while poor Esther was very\nnervous under the dread of the coming trial. But we cheered them with\nour presence, and by the time court opened, they had recovered their\ncomposure.\n\nOur party numbered four women and five men. Esther lacked several\nsummers of being as old as her sister, while I was by five years the\nyoungest of the men, and naturally looked to my elders for leadership.\nHaving left our arms at the house, we entered the court-room in as\ndecorous and well-behaved a manner as if it had been a house of worship\nand this a Sabbath morning. A peculiar stillness pervaded the room,\nwhich could have been mistaken as an omen of peace, or the tension\nsimilar to the lull before a battle. Personally I was composed, but as\nI allowed my eyes from time to time to rest upon Esther, she had never\nseemed so near and dear to me as in that opening hour of court. She\nlooked very pale, and moved by the subtle power of love, I vowed that\nshould any harm come to or any insulting word be spoken of her, my\nvengeance would be sure and swift.\n\nCourt convened, and the case was called. As might have been expected,\nthe judge held that under the pleadings it was not a jury case. The\npanel was accordingly excused for the day, and joined those curiously\ninclined in the main body of the room. The complaining witnesses were\ncalled, and under direct examination the essential facts were brought\nforth, laying the foundation for a legal separation. The plaintiff was\nthe last witness to testify. As she told her simple story, a hushed\nsilence fell over the room, every spectator, from the judge on the\nbench to the sheriff, being eager to catch every syllable of the\nrecital. But as in duty bound to a client, the attorney for the\ndefendant, a young man who had come from San Antonio to conduct the\ncase, opened a sharp cross-questioning. As the examination proceeded,\nan altercation between the attorneys was prevented only by the presence\nof the sheriff and deputies. Before the inquiry progressed, the\nattorney for the plaintiff apologized to the court, pleading\nextenuating circumstances in the offense offered to his client. Under\nhis teachings, he informed the court, the purity of womanhood was above\nsuspicion, and no man who wished to be acknowledged as a gentleman\namong his equals would impugn or question the statement of a lady. The\nwitness on the stand was more to him than an ordinary client, as her\nfather and himself had been young men together, had volunteered under\nthe same flag, his friend offering up his life in its defense, and he\nspared to carry home the news of an unmarked grave on a Southern\nbattle-field. It was a privilege to him to offer his assistance and\ncounsel to-day to a daughter of an old comrade, and any one who had the\ntemerity to offer an affront to this witness would be held to a\npersonal account for his conduct.\n\nThe first day was consumed in taking testimony. The defense introduced\nmuch evidence in rebuttal. Without regard to the truth or their oaths,\na line of witnesses were introduced who contradicted every essential\npoint of the plaintiff’s case. When the credibility of their testimony\nwas attacked, they sought refuge in the technicalities of the law, and\nwere supported by rulings of the presiding judge. When Oxenford took\nthe stand in his own behalf, there were not a dozen persons present who\nbelieved the perjured statements which fell from his lips. Yet when his\ntestimony was subjected to a rigid cross-questioning, every attempt to\nreach the truth precipitated a controversy between attorneys as bitter\nas it was personal. That the defendant at the bar had escaped\nprosecution for swindling the government out of large sums of money for\na mail service never performed was well known to every one present,\nincluding the judge, yet he was allowed to testify against the\ncharacter of a woman pure as a child, while his own past was protected\nfrom exposure by rulings from the bench.\n\nWhen the evidence was all in, court adjourned until the following day.\nThat evening our trio, after escorting the women to the home of their\nfriend, visited every drinking resort, hotel, and public house in the\nvillage, meeting groups of Oxenford’s witnesses, even himself as he\ndispensed good cheer to his henchmen. But no one dared to say a\ndiscourteous word, and after amusing ourselves by a few games of\nbilliards, we mounted our horses and returned to Shepherd’s for the\nnight. As we rode along leisurely, all three of us admitted misgivings\nas to the result, for it was clear that the court had favored the\ndefense. Yet we had a belief that the statutory grounds were\nsufficient, and on that our hopes hung.\n\nThe next morning found our party in court at the opening hour. The\nentire forenoon was occupied by the attorney for the plaintiff in\nreviewing the evidence, analyzing and weighing every particle, showing\nan insight into human motives which proved him a master in his\nprofession. After the noon recess, the young lawyer from the city\naddressed the court for two hours, his remarks running from bombast to\nflights of oratory, and from eulogies upon his client to praise of the\nunimpeachable credibility of the witnesses for the defense. In\nconcluding, the older lawyer prefaced his remarks by alluding to the\ndivine intent in the institution of marriage, and contending that of\nthe two, women were morally the better. In showing the influence of the\nstronger upon the weaker sex, he asserted that it was in the power of\nthe man to lift the woman or to sink her into despair. In his\nperoration he rose to the occasion, and amid breathless silence, facing\nthe court, who quailed before him, demanded whether this was a temple\nof justice. Replying to his own interrogatory, he dipped his brush in\nthe sunshine of life, and sketched a throne with womanhood enshrined\nupon it. While chivalry existed among men, it mattered little, he said,\nas to the decrees of courts, for in that higher tribunal, human hearts,\nwoman would remain forever in control. At his conclusion, women were\nhysterical, and men were aroused from their usual languor by the\neloquence of the speaker. Had the judge rendered an adverse decision at\nthat moment, he would have needed protection; for to the men of the\nSouth it was innate to be chivalrous to womanhood. But the court was\ncautious, and after announcing that he would take the case under\nadvisement until morning, adjourned for the day.\n\nAll during the evening men stood about in small groups and discussed\nthe trial. The consensus of opinion was favorable to the plaintiff. But\nin order to offset public opinion, Oxenford and a squad of followers\nmade the rounds of the public places, offering to wager any sum of\nmoney that the decree would not be granted. Since feeling was running\nrather high, our little party avoided the other faction, and as we were\nunder the necessity of riding out to the ferry for accommodation,\nconcluded to start earlier than the evening before. After saddling, we\nrode around the square, and at the invitation of Deweese dismounted\nbefore a public house for a drink and a cigar before starting. We were\naware that the town was against us, and to maintain a bold front was a\nmatter of necessity. Unbuckling our belts in compliance with the\nsheriff’s orders, we hung our six-shooters on the pommels of our\nsaddles and entered the bar-room. Other customers were being waited on,\nand several minutes passed before we were served. The place was rather\ncrowded, and as we were being waited on, a rabble of roughs surged\nthrough a rear door, led by Jack Oxenford. He walked up to within two\nfeet of me where I stood at the counter, and apparently addressing the\nbarkeeper, as we were charging our glasses, said in a defiant tone:—\n\n“I’ll bet a thousand dollars Judge Thornton refuses to grant a\nseparation between my wife and me.”\n\nThe words flashed through me like an electric shock, and understanding\nthe motive, I turned on the speaker and with the palm of my hand dealt\nhim a slap in the face that sent him staggering back into the arms of\nhis friends. Never before or since have I felt the desire to take human\nlife which possessed me at that instant. With no means of defense in my\npossession but a penknife, I backed away from him, he doing the like,\nand both keeping close to the bar, which was about twenty feet long. In\none hand I gripped the open-bladed pocket knife, and, with the other\nbehind my back, retreated to my end of the counter as did Oxenford to\nhis, never taking our eyes off each other. On reaching his end of the\nbar, I noticed the barkeeper going through motions that looked like\npassing him a gun, and in the same instant some friend behind me laid\nthe butt of a pistol in my hand behind my back. Dropping the knife, I\nshifted the six-shooter to my right hand, and, advancing on the object\nof my hate, fired in such rapid succession that I was unable to tell\neven whether my fire was being returned. When my gun was empty, the\nintervening clouds of smoke prevented any view of my adversary; but my\nlust for his life was only intensified when, on turning to my friends,\nI saw Deweese supporting Hunter in his arms. Knowing that one or the\nother had given me the pistol, I begged them for another to finish my\nwork. But at that moment the smoke arose sufficiently to reveal my\nenemy crippling down at the farther end of the bar, a smoking pistol in\nhis hand. As Oxenford sank to the floor, several of his friends ran to\nhis side, and Deweese, noticing the movement, rallied the wounded man\nin his arms. Shaking him until his eyes opened, June, exultingly as a\nsavage, cried, “Tony, for God’s sake stand up just a moment longer.\nYonder he lies. Let me carry you over so you can watch the cur die.”\nTurning to me he continued: “Tom, you’ve got your man. Run for your\nlife; don’t let them get you.”\n\nPassing out of the house during the excitement, I was in my saddle in\nan instant, riding like a fiend for Shepherd’s. The sun was nearly an\nhour high, and with a good horse under me, I covered the ten miles to\nthe ferry in less than an hour. Portions of the route were sheltered by\ntimber along the river, but once as I crossed a rise opposite a large\nbend, I sighted a posse in pursuit several miles to the rear. On\nreaching Shepherd’s, fortunately for me a single horse stood at the\nhitch-rack. The merchant and owner of the horse came to the door as I\ndashed up, and never offering a word of explanation, I changed horses.\nLuckily the owner of the horse was Red Earnest, a friend of mine, and\nfeeling that they would not have long to wait for explanations, I shook\nout the reins and gave him the rowel. I knew the country, and soon left\nthe river road, taking an air-line course for Las Palomas, which I\nreached within two hours after nightfall. In few and profane words, I\nexplained the situation to my employer, and asked for a horse that\nwould put the Rio Grande behind me before morning. A number were on\npicket near by, and several of the boys ran for the best mounts\navailable. A purse was forced into my pocket, well filled with gold.\nMeanwhile I had in my possession an extra six-shooter, and now that I\nhad a moment’s time to notice it, recognized the gun as belonging to\nTony Hunter. Filling the empty chambers, and waving a farewell to my\nfriends, I passed out by the rear and reached the saddle shed, where a\nwell-known horse was being saddled by dexterous hands. Once on his\nback, I soon passed the eighty miles between me and the Rio Grande,\nwhich I swam on my horse the next morning within an hour after sunrise.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\nSUNSET\n\n\nOf my exile of over two years in Mexico, little need be said. By easy\nstages, I reached the haciendas on the Rio San Juan where we had\nreceived the cows in the summer of ’77. The reception extended me was\nall one could ask, but cooled when it appeared that my errand was one\nof refuge and not of business. I concealed my offense, and was given\nemployment as corporal _segundo_ over a squad of vaqueros. But while\nthe hacienda to which I was attached was larger than Las Palomas, with\ngreater holdings in live-stock, yet my life there was one of penal\nservitude. I strove to blot out past memories in the innocent pleasures\nof my associates, mingling in all the social festivities, dancing with\nthe dark-eyed señoritas and gambling at every _fiesta_. Yet in the\nmidst of the dissipation, there was ever present to my mind the thought\nof a girl, likewise living a life of loneliness at the mouth of the San\nMiguel.\n\nDuring my banishment, but twice did any word or message reach me from\nthe Nueces valley. Within a few months after my locating on the Rio San\nJuan, Enrique Lopez, a trusted vaquero from Las Palomas, came to the\nhacienda, apparently seeking employment. Recognizing me at a glance, at\nthe first opportunity he slipped me a letter unsigned and in an unknown\nhand. After reading it I breathed easier, for both Hunter and Oxenford\nhad recovered, the former having been shot through the upper lobe of a\nlung, while the latter had sustained three wounds, one of which\nresulted in the loss of an arm. The judge had reserved his decision\nuntil the recovery of both men was assured, but before the final\nadjournment of court, refused the decree. I had had misgivings that\nthis would be the result, and the message warned me to remain away, as\nthe stage company was still offering a reward for my arrest. Enrique\nloitered around the camp several days, and on being refused employment,\nmade inquiry for a ranch in the south and rode away in the darkness of\nevening. But we had had several little chats together, in which the\nrascal delivered many oral messages, one of which he swore by all the\nsaints had been intrusted to him by my own sweetheart while visiting at\nthe ranch. But Enrique was capable of enriching any oral message, and I\nwas compelled to read between the lines; yet I hope the saints, to whom\nhe daily prayed, will blot out any untruthful embellishments.\n\nThe second message was given me by Frank Nancrede, early in January,\n’81. As was his custom, he was buying saddle horses at Las Palomas\nduring the winter for trail purposes, when he learned of my whereabouts\nin Mexico. Deweese had given him directions where I could be found, and\nas the Rio San Juan country was noted for good horses, Nancrede and a\ncompanion rode directly from the Nueces valley to the hacienda where I\nwas employed. They were on the lookout for a thousand saddle horses,\nand after buying two hundred from the ranch where I was employed,\nsecured my services as interpreter in buying the remainder. We were\nless than a month in securing the number wanted, and I accompanied the\nherd to the Rio Grande on its way to Texas. Nancrede offered me every\nencouragement to leave Mexico, assuring me that Bethel & Oxenford had\nlost their mail contract between San Antonio and Brownsville, and were\nnow operating in other sections of the state. He was unable to give me\nthe particulars, but frauds had been discovered in Star Route lines,\nand the government had revoked nearly all the mail contracts in\nsouthern Texas. The trail boss promised me a job with any of their\nherds, and assured me that a cow hand of my abilities would never want\na situation in the north. I was anxious to go with him, and would have\ndone so, but felt a compunction which I did not care to broach to him,\nfor I was satisfied he would not understand.\n\nThe summer passed, during which I made it a point to meet other drovers\nfrom Texas who were buying horses and cattle. From several sources the\nreport of Nancrede, that the stage line south from San Antonio was now\nin new hands, was confirmed. One drover assured me that a national\nscandal had grown out of the Star Route contracts, and several\nofficials in high authority had been arraigned for conspiracy to\ndefraud. He further asserted that the new contractor was now carrying\nthe mail for ten per cent, of what was formerly allowed to Bethel &\nOxenford, and making money at the reduced rate. This news was\nencouraging, and after an exile of over two years and a half, I\nrecrossed the Rio Grande on the same horse on which I had entered.\nCarefully avoiding ranches where I was known, two short rides put me in\nLas Palomas, reaching headquarters after nightfall, where, in\nseclusion, I spent a restless day and night.\n\nA few new faces were about the ranch, but the old friends bade me a\nwelcome and assured me that my fears were groundless. During the brief\ntime at my disposal, Miss Jean entertained me with numerous disclosures\nregarding my old sweetheart. The one that both pleased and interested\nme was that she was contented and happy, and that her resignation was\ndue to religious faith. According to my hostess’s story, a camp meeting\nhad been held at Shepherd’s during the fall after my banishment, by a\nsect calling themselves Predestinarians. I have since learned that a\nbelief in a predetermined state is entertained by a great many good\npeople, and I admit it seems as if fate had ordained that Esther McLeod\nand I should never wed. But it was a great satisfaction to know that\nshe felt resigned and could draw solace from a spiritual source, even\nthough the same was denied to me. During the last meeting between\nEsther and Miss Jean, but a few weeks before, the former had confessed\nthat there was now no hope of our ever marrying.\n\nAs I had not seen my parents for several years, I continued my journey\nto my old home on the San Antonio River. Leaving Las Palomas after\nnightfall, I passed the McLeod ranch after midnight. Halting my horse\nto rest, I reviewed the past, and the best reasoning at my command\nshowed nothing encouraging on the horizon. That Esther had sought\nconsolation from a spiritual source did not discourage me; for, under\nmy observation, where it had been put to the test, the love of man and\nwife overrode it. But to expect this contented girl to renounce her\nfaith and become my wife, was expecting her to share with me nothing,\nunless it was the chance of a felon’s cell, and I remounted my horse\nand rode away under a starry sky, somewhat of a fatalist myself. But I\nderived contentment from my decision, and on reaching home no one could\nhave told that I had loved and lost. My parents were delighted to see\nme after my extended absence, my sisters were growing fast into\nwomanhood, and I was bidden the welcome of a prodigal son. During this\nvisit a new avenue in life opened before me, and through the influence\nof my eldest brother I secured a situation with a drover and followed\nthe cattle trail until the occupation became a lost one. My last visit\nto Las Palomas was during the winter of 1894-95. It lacked but a few\nmonths of twenty years since my advent in the Nueces valley. After the\ndeath of Oxenford by small-pox, I had been a frequent visitor at the\nranch, business of one nature and another calling me there. But in this\nlast visit, the wonderful changes which two decades had wrought in the\ncountry visibly impressed me, and I detected a note of decay in the old\nranch. A railroad had been built, passing within ten miles of the\nwestern boundary line of the Ganso grant. The Las Palomas range had\nbeen fenced, several large tracts of land being added after my severing\nactive connections with the ranch. Even the cattle, in spite of all the\nefforts made for their improvement, were not so good as in the old days\nof the open range, or before there was a strand of wire between the\nNueces and Rio Grande rivers. But the alterations in the country were\nnothing compared to the changes in my old master and mistress. Uncle\nLance was nearing his eighty-second birthday, physically feeble, but\nmentally as active as the first morning of our long acquaintance. Miss\nJean, over twenty years the junior of the ranchero, had mellowed into a\nripeness consistent with her days, and in all my aimless wanderings I\nnever saw a brother and sister of their ages more devoted to, or\ndependent on each other.\n\nOn the occasion of this past visit, I was in the employ of a live-stock\ncommission firm. A member of our house expected to attend the cattle\nconvention at Forth Worth in the near future, and I had been sent into\nthe range sections to note the conditions of stock and solicit for my\nemployers. The spring before, our firm had placed sixty thousand cattle\nfor customers. Demand continued, and the house had inquiry sufficient\nto justify them in sending me out to secure, of all ages, not less than\na hundred thousand steer cattle. And thus once more I found myself a\nguest of Las Palomos.\n\n“Don’t talk cattle to me,” said Uncle Lance, when I mentioned my\nbusiness; “go to June—he’ll give you the ages and numbers. And whatever\nyou do, Tom, don’t oversell us, for wire fences have cut us off, until\nit seems like old friends don’t want to neighbor any more. In the days\nof the open range, I used to sell every hoof I had a chance to, but\nsince then things have changed. Why, only last year a jury indicted a\nyoung man below here on the river for mavericking a yearling, and sent\nhim to Huntsville for five years. That’s a fair sample of these modern\ndays. There isn’t a cowman in Texas to-day who amounts to a pinch of\nsnuff, but got his start the same way, but if a poor fellow looks out\nof the corner of his eye now at a critter, they imagine he wants to\nsteal it. Oh, I know them; and the bigger rustlers they were themselves\non the open range, the bitterer their persecution of the man who\nfollows their example.”\n\nJune Deweese was then the active manager of the ranch, and after\nsecuring a classification of their salable stock, I made out a\nmemorandum and secured authority in writing, to sell their holdings at\nprevailing prices for Nueces river cattle. The remainder of the day was\nspent with my old friends in a social visit, and as we delved into the\nmusty past, the old man’s love of the land and his matchmaking\ninstincts constantly cropped out.\n\n“Tom,” said he, in answer to a remark of mine, “I was an awful fool to\nthink my experience could be of any use to you boys. Every last rascal\nof you went off on the trail and left me here with a big ranch to\nhandle. Gallup was no better than the rest, for he kept Jule Wilson\nwaiting until now she’s an old maid. Sis, here, always called Scales a\nvagabond, but I still believe something could have been made of him\nwith a little encouragement. But when the exodus of the cattle to the\nnorth was at its height, he went off with a trail herd just like the\nrest of you. Then he followed the trail towns as a gambler, saved\nmoney, and after the cattle driving ended, married an adventuress, and\nthat’s the end of him. The lack of a market was one of the great\ndrawbacks to ranching, but when the trail took every hoof we could\nbreed and every horse we could spare, it also took my boys. Tom, when\nyou get old, you’ll understand that all is vanity and vexation of\nspirit. But I am perfectly resigned now. In my will, Las Palomas and\neverything I have goes to Jean. She can dispose of it as she sees fit,\nand if I knew she was going to leave it to Father Norquin or his\nsuccessor, my finger wouldn’t be raised to stop it. I spent a lifetime\nof hard work acquiring this land, and now that there is no one to care\nfor the old ranch, I wash my hands of it.”\n\nKnowing the lifetime of self-sacrifice in securing the land of Las\nPalomas, I sympathized with the old ranchero in his despondency.\n\n“I never blamed you much, Tom,” he resumed after a silence; “but\nthere’s something about cattle life which I can’t explain. It seems to\ndisqualify a man for ever making a good citizen afterward. He roams and\nruns around, wasting his youth, and gets so foxy he never marries.”\n\n“But June and the widow made the riffle finally,” I protested.\n\n“Yes, they did, and that’s something to the good, but they never had\nany children. Waited ten years after Annear was killed, and then got\nmarried. That was one of Jean’s matches. Tom, you must go over and see\nJuana before you go. There was a match that I made. Just think of it,\nthey have eight children, and Fidel is prouder over them than I ever\nwas of this ranch. The natives have never disappointed me, but the\nCaucasian seems to be played out.”\n\nI remained overnight at the ranch. After supper, sitting in his chair\nbefore a cheerful fire, Uncle Lance dozed off to sleep, leaving his\nsister and myself to entertain each other. I had little to say of my\npast, and the future was not encouraging, except there was always work\nto do. But Miss Jean unfolded like the pages of an absorbing chronicle,\nand gave me the history of my old acquaintances in the valley. Only a\nfew of the girls had married. Frances Vaux, after flirting away her\nyouth, had taken the veil in one of the orders in her church. My old\nsweetheart was contentedly living a life of seclusion on the ranch on\nwhich she was born, apparently happy, but still interested in any word\nof me in my wanderings. The young men of my acquaintance, except where\nmarried, were scattered wide, the whereabouts of nearly all of them\nunknown. Tony Hunter had held the McLeod estate together, and it had\nprospered exceedingly under his management. My old friend, Red Earnest,\nwho outrode me in the relay race at the tournament in June, ’77, was\nmarried and serving in the Customs Service on the Rio Grande as a\nmounted river guard.\n\nThe next morning, I made the round of the Mexican quarters, greeting my\nold friends, before taking my leave and starting for the railroad. The\ncottage which had been built for Esther and me stood vacant and\nwindowless, being used only for a storehouse for _zacahuiste_. As I\nrode away, the sight oppressed me; it brought back the June time of my\nyouth, even the hour and instant in which our paths separated. On\nreaching the last swell of ground, several miles from the ranch, which\nwould give me a glimpse of headquarters, I halted my horse in a\nfarewell view. The sleepy old ranch cosily nestled among the encinal\noaks revived a hundred memories, some sad, some happy, many of which\nhave returned in retrospect during lonely hours since.",

The chief Dignitary of Cambridge, the Chancellor, the\nDuke of DEVONSHIRE.\n\n_Tutor_. You are trifling with me.\n\n_Undergraduate_. Not at all, Sir. The Chancellor was there in state. I\nsaw him. My curiosity was satisfied, and I returned to Cambridge.\n\n_Tutor_ (_after a pause_). Ah, of course that alters the case. If you\ncan assure me you did not go for the purpose of watching horse-races--\n\n_Undergraduate_ (_breaking in_). Certainly, Sir. I do give you the\nassurance.\n\n_Tutor_.

You are a victim of our insensate\nLand Laws, or exploded Feudalism. No doubt you are leaving the country\nbecause you could not find employment there?\n\n_Rural Labourer_. 'Tisn't that so much. Old Gaffer always had summat\nfor a man to do, I can tell ye.\n\n_Radical Reformer_. Glad to hear it, though it's unusual.

Come now, don't you call my house a\npigstye! Three good rooms, and not a bit o' damp or dirt about it.\n\n_Radical Reformer_.

Then would you explain to me what is\nthe _real_ reason of your determination to quit the country for Town?\n\n_Rural Labourer_ (_surprised_).

It was entirely his own idea.\n\"The Liberals have their Rural Conferences,\" he said at a recent\nCabinet Council, \"and we should do something of the same kind; only we\nmust go one better. Of course the delegates liked their trip to London\n(expenses paid, their free breakfast, their shake of Mr. GLADSTONE's\nhand, and the opportunity of gazing on the supple form of Mr.\nSCHNADHORST.) That's all very well for them. But think of the hundreds\nof thousands green with jealousy because they weren't selected for\nthe trip? These are all ripe to vote for us at the General Election\nif only delicately handled. What you want is a man of commanding\npresence, unfailing tact, a knowledge of horses, and some gift of\noratory.

So the Minister of Agriculture set forth\non his missionary enterprise.\n\nWe have been gratified by the receipt of many tokens of interest and\nappreciation elicited by our paragraph last week, reporting the state\nof the household markets.

The roof and part\n    of the façade gleam a greenish silver in the moonlight. The\n    shadow of the Campanile falls, black and broad, across the\n    huge square, which is crowded with people listening to the\n    Military Band, and taking coffee, &c., outside the caffés.\n    Miss TROTTER and CULCHARD are seated at one of the little\n    tables in front of the Quadri._\n\n_Miss T._ I'd like ever so much to know why it is you're so anxious\nto see that Miss PRENDERGAST and me friendly again? After she's been\ntreating you this long while like you were a toad--and not a popular\nkind of toad at that!\n\n_Culch._ (_wincing_). Of course I am only too painfully aware of--of\na certain distance in her manner towards me, but I should not think\nof allowing myself to be influenced by any--er--merely personal\nconsiderations of that sort.\n\n_Miss T._ That's real noble! And I presume, now, you cann't imagine\nany reason why she's been treading you so flat.\n\n[Illustration: \"A mean cuss? Me! Really--\"]\n\n_Culch._ (_with a shrug_). I really haven't troubled to speculate Who\ncan tell how one may, quite unconsciously, give offence--even to those\nwho are--er--comparative strangers?\n\n_Miss T._ Just so. (_A pause._) Well, Mr. CULCHARD, if I wanted\nanything to confirm my opinion of you, I guess you've given it me!\n\n_Culch._ (_internally_). It's very unfortunate that she _will_ insist\non idealising me like this!\n\n_Miss T._ Maybe, now, you can form a pretty good idea already what\nthat opinion is?\n\n_Culch._ (_in modest deprecation_). You give me some reason for\ninferring that it is far higher than I deserve.\n\n_Miss T._ Well, I don't know that you've missed your guess altogether.\nAre you through your ice-cream yet?\n\n_Culch._ Almost. (_He finishes his ice._) It is really most\nrefreshing!\n\n_Miss T._ Then, now you're refreshed, I'll tell you what I think about\nyou. (_CULCHARD resigns himself to enthusiasm._) My opinion of you,\nMr. CULCHARD, is that, taking you by and large, you amount to what we\nAmurrcans describe as \"a pretty mean cuss.\"\n\n_Culch._ (_genuinely surprised_). A mean cuss? Me! Really, this\nunjustifiable language is _most_--!\n\n_Miss T._ Well, I don't just know what your dictionary term would\nbe for a man who goes and vows exclusive devotion to one young lady,\nwhile he's waiting for his answer from another, and keeps his head\nclose shut to each about it. Or a man who backs out of his vows by\ntrading off the sloppiest kind of flap-doodle about not wishing to\nblight the hopes of his dearest friend. Or a man who has been trying\nhis hardest to get into the good graces again of the young lady he\nwent back on first, so he can cut out that same dearest friend of his,\nand leave the girl he's haff engaged to right out in the cold. And\nputs it all off on the high-toned-est old sentiments, too. But I\ndon't consider the expression, \"a mean cuss,\" too picturesque for that\nparticular kind of hero myself!\n\n_Culch._ (_breathing hard_). Your feelings have apparently undergone a\nsudden change--quite recently!\n\n_Miss T._ Well, no, the change dates back considerable--ever since we\nwere at the Villa d'Este. Only, I like Mr. PODBURY pretty well, and I\nallowed he ought to have fair play, so I concluded I'd keep you around\nso you shouldn't get a chance of spoiling your perfectly splendid act\nof self-denial--and I guess I've _kept_ you around pretty much all the\ntime!\n\n_Culch._ (_bitterly_). In other words, you have behaved like a\nheartless coquette!\n\n_Miss T._ You may put it at that if you like. Maybe it wouldn't have\nbeen just the square thing to do if you'd been a different sort of\nman--but you wanted to be taught that you couldn't have all the fun\nof flirtation on _your_ side, and I wasn't afraid the emotional strain\nwas going to shatter you up to any serious extent. Now it's left off\namusing me, and I guess it's time to stop.

Foible apart, HENRY the Norman has contributed an\ninteresting chapter to the history of a singularly attractive people.\nThere is nothing new in the heavier parts, which smell vilely of Blue\nBooks, and might as well have been written in Northumberland Street\nas in Yokohama.

The Baron shrinks from correcting a lady's grammar, but\nto say \"_Mrs. Randal Morgan_ lay down the law\" is not the best Sunday\nEnglish as she is spoke. From _Fin-de-Siècle Stories_, by Messrs\nLAWRENCE AND CADETT, the Baron selects \"A Wife's Secret\" (nothing\nto do with the old play of that name), \"Mexico,\" and \"Honour is\nSatisfied.\" Try these, and you'll have had a fine specimen of an\ninteresting _passe-temps_ collection says,\n\nTHE BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.\n\nIn an article on the Salvationist disturbances at Eastbourne,\nthe _Times_ said that after the scuffle, \"the Army reformed its\ndishevelled battalions, and marched back to its 'citadel' without\nmolestation.\" In another sense, the sooner a reformation of the entire\nArmy is effected in the exercise of Christian charity, which\nmeans consideration for their neighbours' feelings, the better for\nthemselves and for the non-combatants of every denomination.\n\n\"A BAR MESS.\"--Recent difficulties about latitude of Counsel in\nCross-examination.\n\n[Illustration: OF THE WORLD WORLDLY.\n\n\"THERE GO THE SPICER WILCOXES, MAMMA!

Other Confessors have\nnever admitted that they are Social Duffers, except Mr. MARK PATTISON\nonly, the Rector of Lincoln College; and he seems to have Flattered\nhimself that he was only a Duffer as a beginner. My great prototypes,\nJ.J. ROUSSEAU, and MARIE BASHKIRTSEFF, never own to having been Social\nDuffers. But I cannot conceal the fact from my own introspective\nanalysis. It is not only that I was always shy. Others have fled, and\nhidden themselves in the laurels, or the hedgerows, when they met a\nlady in the way--but they grew out of this cowardly practice. Often\nhave I, in a frantic attempt to conceal myself behind a hedge, been\nbetrayed by my fishing-rod, which stuck out over the top. The giggles\nof the young women who observed me were hard to bear, but I confess\nthat they were not unnatural.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nShyness is a fine qualification in a Social Duffer, and it is greatly\nimproved by shortness, and, as one may say, stupidity of sight. I\nnever recognise anyone whom I know; on the other hand, I frequently\nrecognise people whom I never saw before in my life, and salute them\nwith a heartiness which they fail to appreciate. Once, at an evening\nparty, where the Princess BERGSTOL was present, a lady, who had\ntreated me with hospitable kindness, I three times mistook her; once\nfor an eminent novelist, once for a distinguished philanthropist,\nand once for an admired female performer on the Banjo. I carried\non conversations with her in each of these three imaginary\ncharacters,--and I ask you, is this the way to shine in Society?\nYou may say, \"Wear spectacles\"--but they are unbecoming. As to an\neye-glass, somehow it irritates people even more than mere blindness\ndoes. Besides, it is always dropping into one's soup.\n\nPeople are always accosting me, people who seem vaguely familiar, and\nthen I have to make believe very much that I remember them, and to\nwait for casual hints. The more I feel confident that I know them, the\nmore it turns out that I don't. It is an awful thing to stop a hansom\nin the street, thinking that its occupant is your oldest College\nfriend, and to discover that he is a perfect stranger, and in a great\nhurry. Private Views are my particular abomination. At one such show,\nseven ladies, all very handsome and peculiarly attired, addressed me\nin the most friendly manner, calling me by my name. They cannot have\ntaken me for either of my Doubles,--one is a Cabinet Minister, one is\na dentist,--for they knew my name, The MACDUFFER of Duff. Yet I had\nnot then, nor have I now, the faintest idea who any one of the seven\nwas. My belief is that it was done for a bet. The worst of it is when,\nafter about five minutes, I think I have a line as to who my companion\nreally is, then, my intelligent features lighting up, I make some\nremark which ruins everything, congratulate a stockbroker on getting\nhis step, or an unmarried lady on the success of her son in the Indian\nCivil Service examination.\n\nThe thing goes so far that I have occasionally mistaken my wife's\nrelations for old friends. Then, when I am hostile, it is just as bad.\nI never, indeed, horsewhipped the wrong man, but that is only because\nI never horsewhipped anybody at all, Heaven forefend! But _once_ I did\nmean to cut a man, I forget why. So I cut the wrong man, a harmless\nacquaintance whose feelings I would not have hurt for the world.\nOf course I accidentally cut all the world. Some set it down to an\nirritable temper, and ask, \"What can we have done to The MACDUFFER?\"\nOthers think I am proud. Proud! I ask, what has a Duffer to be proud\nof? Nobody, or very few, admit that I am just a Duffer; a stupid,\nshort-sighted, absent-minded child of misfortune.\n\nAll these things do not make my life so pleasant to me that I, the\nMACDUFFER, should greatly care to dine out. Ah, that _is_ a trial.\nFirst, I never know my host and hostess by sight. Next, in a summer\ndusk, I never know anybody. Then, as to conversation, I have none.\nMy mind is always prowling about on some antiquarian hobby-horse,\nreflecting deeply on the Gowrie Conspiracy, or the Raid of Ruthven, or\nthe chances in favour of PERKIN WARBECK's having been a true man. Now\nI do object to talking shop, I am not a lawyer, nor yet am I an actor;\nI do not like people who talk about their cases, or their parts.\nIt would he unbecoming to start a conversation on the authenticity\nof \"HENRY GORING's _Letter_.\" Then I never go to the play, I do\nnot even know which of the Royal Family is which: modern pictures\nare the abominations of desolation to me; in fact, I have no\n\"conversation-openings.\" A young lady, compelled to sit beside me,\nhas been known to hum tunes, and telegraph messages of her forlorn\ncondition to her sister, at the opposite end of the table. I pitied\nher, but was helpless. My impression is that she was musical, poor\nsoul! When I do talk, things become actively intolerable. I have\nno tact. To have tact, is much like being good at Halma, or whist,\nor tennis, or chess. You must be able to calculate the remote\nconsequences of every move, and all the angles and side-walls from\nwhich the conversational hall may bound. It is needless to say that,\nat whist, I never know in the least what will happen in consequence of\nthe card I play; and life is very much too short for the interminable\ncalculations of chess. It is the same in conversation. I never know,\nor, if my sub-consciousness knows, I never remember, who anybody\nis. I speak to people about scandals with which they are connected.\nI frankly give my mind about Mr. DULL's poems to Mr. DULL's\nsister-in-law. I give free play to my humour about the Royal Academy\nin talk with the wife of an Academician of whom I never heard. I am\nlike _Jeanie Deans_, at her interview with Queen CAROLINE, when, as\nthe MACALLUM MORE said, she first brought down the Queen, and then\nLady SUFFOLK, right and left, with remarks about unkind mothers, and\nthe Stool of Penitence.\n\nThus you may see me forlorn, with each of my neighbours turning\ntowards me the shoulder of indignation. I do not blame them, but how\ncan I help it? It is the Fairy's fault: the curse has come upon me.\nWILLIAM BUFFY, the Statesman, has a great clan of kinsfolk. Did I ever\nexpress my views about WILLIAM BUFFY, but one of Clan Buffy was there,\nto be annoyed? When I find out what has occurred, I become as red as\nany tomato, but that does nobody any good.\n\nOh, I am a Pariah, I am unfit to live! In a savage country, to which\nmy thoughts often wander, I would stumble over every taboo, and soon\nfind myself in the oven. As it is, I stumble over everything, stools\nand lady's trains, and upset porcelain, and break all the odds and\nends with which I fidget, and spill the salt, and then pour claret\nover it, and call on the right people at the wrong houses, and put\nletters in the wrong envelopes: one of the most terrible blunders of\nthe Social Duffer. Naturally, in place of improving, MACDUFFER gets\nworse and worse: every failure which he discovers makes him more\nnervous: besides he knows that, of all his errors, he only finds out a\nsmall per-centage. Where can he take refuge? If _Robinson Crusoe_ had\nbeen a social Duffer, he and _Friday_ would not have been on speaking\nterms in a week. People think the poor Duffer malignant, boorish,\nhaughty, unkind; he is only a Duffer, an irreclaimable, sad, pitiful\ncreature, quite beyond the reach of philanthropy. On my grave write,\nnot MISERRIMUS (though that would be true enough), but FUTILISSIMUS.\n\n[Illustration: OUR SPECIAL ARTIST ON TOUR.\n\n_Effect of Sketching in the Train_.

To uphold every Shareholder's claim to Acting as an Art.\n\n2. To secure the best possible criticism by enabling every shareholder\nto write the notices of his own performances.\n\n3. To take cognisance of the literature that grows up around the\nStage, especially criticism in other quarters.\n\n4. To notice the Drama all the world over, when space permits.\n\n5. To support the work of the Profession in general, and the\nShareholders in particular.\n\n6. To afford a means of exercising hobbies.\n\n7. To contain Articles by any of the recognised critics\n(\"distinguished writers of the day\").\n\n8. To serve as a Directory, or _Vade Mecum_, or Press-notes container\nfor the benefit of the Shareholders.\n\nMany leading theatrical lessees, managers, and actors, have expressed\nthemselves strongly in favour of the necessity of establishing a\npaper, written by themselves, for themselves, to read. Without such\nan organ it is impossible that they can be adequately represented.\n\nThe need of such a journal has long been felt by those whose\ntheatrical notices have been the reverse of satisfactory.\n\nA large number of prominent players have promised to take shares, and\nadvertise, not only in the advertisement columns, but in other parts\nof the proposed paper.\n\nThe price of the paper will be hereafter settled by the Directors,\nwho feel that this is a mere matter of detail. The charge for\nadvertisements will be very moderate, to suit the requirements of\nthe shareholders.\n\nPictures and all sorts of clever things will be introduced when the\ncapital is subscribed, but it's no use making promises until the\nbankers have got the money.\n\nIf there is a rush for shares (as anticipated), those who come first\nwill have the preference.\n\nIt may be stated that lots of people have promised to become\nshareholders which is satisfactory. But it is necessary to add that\nno one will be permitted to become a contributor to the paper even of\nthe most interesting nature (i.e., Press notices, &c.), until he has\ncontributed to its capital.\n\nIt is the intention of the Promoters that the majority of the shares\nthat be allotted to persons in or connected with the profession, so\nthat there shall be no nonsense from outsiders.\n\nNo promotion money will be paid to anyone. The only preliminary\nexpenses will be those connected with law and stationery.\n\nIt is proposed to start the Journal at once, per contract. The\nPromoters are in communication with a gentleman who will make a\nfirst-rate Editor, and who will (they believe) be delighted to accept\nsuch an appointment if offered to him. Special arrangements will be\nmade for the insertion of such advertisements as \"Wigs on the Green\"\nand \"Curtain Razors.\"\n\nAs the paper will be sent about largely, it should have a good\ncirculation, and the Promoters give as a standing toast, \"Success to\nthe Advertisement Department!\"\n\nUnder such brilliant auspices, both the Company and the paper (as the\nlegal advisers, Messrs. BOX & COX would say) \"should be satisfied.\"\n\nIn the event of no money being received, the amount will be returned\nwithout deductions.\n\nCRIES WITHOUT WOOL.\n\nNO. 1.--\"HALL THE WINNERS!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n  Of all the cries this world can boast--\n  A loud, unconscionable host--\n  There's one that I detest the most--\n  It haunts me o'er my morning toast,\n    It scares my luncheon's calm and dinner's.\n  It dogs my steps throughout the week,\n  That cursed crescendo of a shriek;\n  I cannot read, or write, or speak,\n  Undeafened by its howl unique,\n    That demon-yell of \"Hall the Winners!\"\n\n  I'm not, I own, a racing man;\n  I never loved a horse that ran,\n  And betting is a vice I ban;\n  Still, to the sporting caravan--\n    Or good, or bad, or saints, or sinners--\n  I bear no malice; nor would take\n  A leaf from any books they make;\n  Why then, should _they_, for mercy's sake,\n  Pursue me till my senses ache\n    With that relentless \"Hall the Winners?\"\n\n  If it were only but a few,\n  But \"_Hall_ the Winners!\"--why, the crew\n  Must winning be the whole year through!\n  Why can't a veteran or two\n    Retire in favour of beginners?\n  I'd rather welcome e'en the strain\n  Of \"Hall the Losers!\" than remain\n  A martyr frenzied and profane\n  To that importunate refrain\n  Of (There! they're at it!!) \"Hall the Winners!\"\n\nTHE HONOUR OF THE BAR.\n\n_TO THE EDITOR OF PUNCH._\n\nSIR,--As the _London Charivari_ is recognised all the world over\nas the universally acknowledged organ of the legal profession in\nEngland, will you permit me to make an explanation nearly touching my\nprofessional reputation. A few days since, a Correspondent to one of\nyour contemporaries complained that the leading Counsel of the epoch\nwere in the habit of accepting fees they never intended to earn. He\nmore than hinted that we Barristers were prone to receive cheques for\nbriefs that we knew we would never attend to; that we were ready to be\npaid for being present in one Court, when we knew that we were sure to\nbe engaged in another. And so and so on.\n\nNow there can be but one interpretation to such a statement. I am\nreluctantly compelled to believe that some learned friend or other,\nannoyed at my increasing practice, has levelled this blow at me, with\na view to lessening my prosperity. Will you let me say then, once and\nfor all, I have never received fees for briefs to which I have paid no\nattention; that my presence has never been required in one Court when\nI have been professionally engaged in another? My Clerk, PORTINGTON,\nwho has been with me for many years, will tell anyone interested in\nthe matter, that I am most careful not to accept papers promiscuously.\nIn conclusion, anyone who knows me will refuse to believe that I have\never accepted more business than that to which I have been able to\ngive proper attention. It is not my custom to crowd my mantelpiece\nwith papers appealing to me in vain for my consideration. At this\nmoment I have not a single matter demanding my care, except a bundle\nsent in to me three years ago by a madman.\n\n  Believe me, yours most truly,\n  (_Signed_) A BRIEFLESS, JUNIOR.\n  _Pump-Handle Court_,\n  _January 18, 1892._\n\nTOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING.--_Mr. Punch_ is glad to congratulate\neverybody on the improvement in the health of JOHN LAWRENCE TOOLE,\ncomedian. It may be remembered that Mr. TOOLE, being at Mr. EDMUND\nROUTLEDGE's house, and suddenly feeling unwell, was pressed by his\nkind host to stay there the night.

So many persons have\nacted on his advice, and when calling on Mr. ROUTLEDGE, in quite a\ncasual and friendly way, apparently, have been suddenly taken worse,\nthat the benevolent publisher who feels deeply the necessity of\nshowing these distressing visitors at once to the door, wishes it\ngenerally to be known that \"Open House\" is closed as a \"Casual Ward,\"\nand that he is not at home to anybody; except _bonâ fide_ visitors\nwho will give their written word, under penalties, not to be taken ill\nduring their brief interview with him.\n\nNOTICE.--Rejected Communications or Contributions, whether MS.,\nPrinted Matter, Drawings, or Pictures of any description, will in no\ncase be returned, not even when accompanied by a Stamped and Addressed\nEnvelope, Cover, or Wrapper.

His\nfriends have nevertheless deemed it expedient to publish the result of\nhis studies conducted with so much ardor, in order that some memorial of\nhis life and work should remain for the wider public. To those\nacquainted with him, no written words can represent the charm of his\npersonality or give anything approaching an adequate impression of his\nability and strength of character.\n\nConrad Hjalmar Nordby was born September 20, 1867, at Christiania,\nNorway. At the age of four he was brought to New York, where he was\neducated in the public schools. He was graduated from the College of the\nCity of New York in 1886. From December of that year to June, 1893, he\ntaught in Grammar School No. 55, and in September, 1893, he was called\nto his Alma Mater as Tutor in English. He was promoted to the rank of\nInstructor in 1897, a position which he held at the time of his death.\nHe died in St. Luke's Hospital, October 28, 1900. In October, 1894, he\nbegan his studies in the School of Philosophy of Columbia University,\ntaking courses in Philosophy and Education under Professor Nicholas\nMurray Butler, and in Germanic Literatures and Germanic Philology under\nProfessors Boyesen, William H. Carpenter and Calvin Thomas. It was under\nthe guidance of Professor Carpenter that the present work was conceived\nand executed.\n\nSuch a brief outline of Mr. Nordby's career can, however, give but an\nimperfect view of his activities, while it gives none at all of his\ninfluence. He was a teacher who impressed his personality, not only upon\nhis students, but upon all who knew him. In his character were united\nforce and refinement, firmness and geniality. In his earnest work with\nhis pupils, in his lectures to the teachers of the New York Public\nSchools and to other audiences, in his personal influence upon all with\nwhom he came in contact, he spread the taste for beauty, both of poetry\nand of life. When his body was carried to the grave, the grief was not\nconfined to a few intimate friends; all who had known him felt that\nsomething noble and beautiful had vanished from their lives.\n\nIn this regard his career was, indeed, rich in achievement, but when we\nconsider what, with his large equipment, he might have done in the world\nof scholarship, the promise, so untimely blighted, seems even richer.\nFrom early youth he had been a true lover of books. To him they were not\ndead things; they palpitated with the life blood of master spirits. The\nenthusiasm for William Morris displayed in the present essay is typical\nof his feeling for all that he considered best in literature. Such an\nenthusiasm, communicated to those about him, rendered him a vital force\nin every company where works of creative genius could be a theme of\nconversation.\n\nA love of nature and of art accompanied and reinforced this love of\nliterature; and all combined to produce the effect of wholesome purity\nand elevation which continually emanated from him. His influence, in\nfact, was largely of that pervasive sort which depends, not on any\nspecial word uttered, and above all, not on any preachment, but upon the\nentire character and life of the man. It was for this reason that his\nmodesty never concealed his strength. He shrunk above all things from\npushing himself forward and demanding public notice, and yet few ever\nmet him without feeling the force of character that lay behind his\ngentle and almost retiring demeanor. It was easy to recognize that here\nwas a man, self-centered and whole.\n\nIn a discourse pronounced at a memorial meeting, the Rev. John Coleman\nAdams justly said: \"If I wished to set before my boy a type of what is\nbest and most lovable in the American youth, I think I could find no\nmore admirable character than that of Conrad Hjalmar Nordby. A young man\nof the people, with all their unexhausted force, vitality and\nenthusiasm; a man of simple aims and honest ways; as chivalrous and\nhigh-minded as any knight of old; as pure in life as a woman; at once\ngentle and brave, strong and sweet, just and loving; upright, but no\nPharisee; earnest, but never sanctimonious; who took his work as a\npleasure, and his pleasure as an innocent joy; a friend to be coveted; a\ndisciple such as the Saviour must have loved; a true son of God, who\ndwelt in the Father's house. Of such youth our land may well be proud;\nand no man need speak despairingly of a nation whose life and\ninstitutions can ripen such a fruit.\"\n\n    L.F.M.\n    COLLEGE OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK,\n    May 15, 1901.\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTORY.\n\n\nIt should not be hard for the general reader to understand that the\ninfluence which is the theme of this dissertation is real and\nexplicable. If he will but call the roll of his favorite heroes, he will\nfind Sigurd there. In his gallery of wondrous women, he certainly\ncherishes Brynhild. These poetic creations belong to the\nEnglish-speaking race, because they belong to the world. And if one will\nbut recall the close kinship of the Icelandic and the Anglo-Saxon\nlanguages, he will not find it strange that the spirit of the old Norse\nsagas lives again in our English song and story.\n\nThe survey that this essay takes begins with Thomas Gray (1716-1771),\nand comes down to the present day. It finds the fullest measure of the\nold Norse poetic spirit in William Morris (1834-1896), and an increasing\ninterest and delight in it as we come toward our own time. The\nenterprise of learned societies and enlightened book publishers has\nspread a knowledge of Icelandic literature among the reading classes of\nthe present day; but the taste for it is not to be accounted for in the\nsame way. That is of nobler birth than of erudition or commercial pride.\nIs it not another expression of that changed feeling for the things that\npertain to the common people, which distinguishes our century from the\nlast? The historian no longer limits his study to camp and court; the\npoet deigns to leave the drawing-room and library for humbler scenes.\nFolk-lore is now dignified into a science. The touch of nature has made\nthe whole world kin, and our highly civilized century is moved by the\nrecords of the passions of the earlier society.\n\nThis change in taste was long in coming, and the emotional phase of it\nhas preceded the intellectual. It is interesting to note that Gray and\nMorris both failed to carry their public with them all the way. Gray,\nthe most cultured man of his time, produced art forms totally different\nfrom those in vogue, and Walpole[1] said of these forms: \"Gray has\nadded to his poems three ancient odes from Norway and Wales ... they are\nnot interesting, and do not, like his other poems, touch any passion....\nWho can care through what horrors a Runic savage arrived at all the joys\nand glories they could conceive--the supreme felicity of boozing ale out\nof the skull of an enemy in Odin's Hall?\"\n\nMorris, the most versatile man of his time, found plenty of praise for\nhis art work, until he preached social reform to Englishmen. Thereafter\nthe art of William Morris was not so highly esteemed, and the best poet\nin England failed to attain the laurel on the death of Tennyson.\n\nOf this change of taste more will be said as this essay is developed.\nThese introductory words must not be left, however, without an\nexplanation of the word \"Influence,\" as it is used in the subject-title.\nThis paper will not undertake to prove that the course of English\nliterature was diverted into new channels by the introduction of Old\nNorse elements, or that its nature was materially changed thereby. We\nfind an expression and a justification of our present purpose in Richard\nPrice's Preface to the 1824 edition of Warton's \"History of English\nPoetry\" (p. 15): \"It was of importance to notice the successive\nacquisitions, in the shape of translation or imitation, from the more\npolished productions of Greece and Rome; and to mark the dawn of that\næra, which, by directing the human mind to the study of classical\nantiquity, was to give a new impetus to science and literature, and by\nthe changes it introduced to effect a total revolution in the laws which\nhad previously governed them.\" Were Warton writing his history to-day,\nhe would have to account for later eras as well as for the Elizabethan,\nand the method would be the same. How far the Old Norse literature has\nhelped to form these later eras it is not easy to say, but the\ncontributions may be counted up, and their literary value noted. These\nare the commission of the present essay. When the record is finished, we\nshall be in possession of information that may account for certain\nconsiderable writers of our day, and certain tendencies of thought.\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS.\n\n\n    Prefatory Note\n\n    Introductory\n\n      I.

In the Latter Days\n             Echoes of Iceland in Later Poets\n             Recent Translations\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\nTHE BODY OF OLD NORSE LITERATURE.\n\n\nFirst, let us understand what the Old Norse literature was that has been\nsending out this constantly increasing influence into the world of\npoetry.\n\nIt was in the last four decades of the ninth century of our era that\nNorsemen began to leave their own country and set up new homes in\nIceland. The sixty years ending with 930 A.D. were devoted to taking up\nthe land, and the hundred years that ensued after that date were devoted\nto quarreling about that land. These quarrels were the origin of the\nIcelandic family sagas. The year 1000 brought Christianity to the\nisland, and the period from 1030 to 1120 were years of peace in which\nstories of the former time passed from mouth to mouth. The next century\nsaw these stories take written form, and the period from 1220 to 1260\nwas the golden age of this literature. In 1264, Iceland passed under the\nrule of Norway, and a decline of literature began, extending until 1400,\nthe end of literary production in Iceland. In the main, the authors of\nIceland are unknown[2].\n\nThere are several well-marked periods, therefore, in Icelandic literary\nproduction. The earliest was devoted to poetry, Icelandic being no\ndifferent from most other languages in the precedence of that form.\nBefore the settlement of Iceland, the Norse lands were acquainted with\nsongs about gods and champions, written in a simple verse form. The\nfirst settlers wrote down some of these, and forgot others. In the\n_Codex Regius_, preserved in the Royal Library in Copenhagen, we have a\ncollection of these songs. This material was published in the\nseventeenth century as the _Sæmundar Edda_, and came to be known as the\n_Elder_ or _Poetic Edda_. Both titles are misnomers, for Sæmund had\nnothing to do with the making of the book, and _Edda_ is a name\nbelonging to a book of later date and different purpose.\n\nThis work--not a product of the soil as folk-songs are--is the fountain\nhead of Old Norse mythology, and of Old Norse heroic legends. _Völuspá_\nand _Hávamál_ are in this collection, and other songs that tell of Odin\nand Baldur and Loki. The Helgi poems and the Völsung poems in their\nearliest forms are also here.\n\nA second class of poetry in this ancient literature is that called\n\"Skaldic.\" Some of this deals with mythical material, and some with\nhistorical material. A few of the skalds are known to us by name,\nbecause their lives were written down in later sagas. Egill\nSkallagrímsson, known to all readers of English and Scotch antiquities,\nEyvind Skáldaspillir and Sigvat are of this group.\n\nPoetic material that is very rich is found in Snorri Sturluson's work on\nOld Norse poetics, entitled _The Edda_, and often referred to as the\n_Younger_ or _Prose Edda_.\n\nMore valuable than the poetry is the prose of this literature,\nespecially the _Sagas_. The saga is a prose epic, characteristic of the\nNorse countries. It records the life of a hero, told according to fixed\nrules. As we have said, the sagas were based upon careers run in\nIceland's stormy time. They are both mythical and historical. In the\nmythical group are, among others, the _Völsunga Saga_, the _Hervarar\nSaga_, _Friðthjófs Saga_ and _Ragnar Loðbróks Saga_. In the historical\ngroup, the flowering time of which was 1200-1270, we find, for example,\n_Egils Saga_, _Eyrbyggja Saga_, _Laxdæla Saga_, _Grettis Saga_, _Njáls\nSaga_. A branch of the historic sagas is the Kings' Sagas, in which we\nfind _Heimskringla_, the _Saga of Olaf Tryggvason_, the _Flatey Book_,\nand others.\n\nThis sketch does not pretend to indicate the quantity of Old Norse\nliterature. An idea of that is obtained by considering the fact that\neleven columns of the ninth edition of the _Encyclopædia Britannica_ are\ndevoted to recording the works of that body of writings.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\nTHROUGH THE MEDIUM OF LATIN.\n\nTHOMAS GRAY (1716-1771).\n\n\nIn the eighteenth century, Old Norse literature was the lore of\nantiquarians. That it is not so to-day among English readers is due to a\nline of writers, first of whom was Thomas Gray. In the thin volume of\nhis poetry, two pieces bear the sub-title: \"An Ode. From the Norse\nTongue.\" These are \"The Fatal Sisters,\" and \"The Descent of Odin,\" both\nwritten in 1761, though not published until 1768. These poems are among\nthe latest that Gray gave to the world, and are interesting aside from\nour present purpose because they mark the limit of Gray's progress\ntoward Romanticism.\n\nWe are not accustomed to think of Gray as a Romantic poet, although we\nknow well that the movement away from the so-called Classicism was begun\nlong before he died. The Romantic element in his poetry is not obvious;\nonly the close observer detects it, and then only in a few of the poems.\nThe Pindaric odes exhibit a treatment that is Romantic, and the Norse\nand Welsh adaptations are on subjects that are Romantic. But we must go\nto his letters to find proof positive of his sympathy with the breaking\naway from Classicism. Here are records of a love of outdoors that\nreveled in mountain-climbing and the buffeting of storms. Here are\nappreciations of Shakespeare and of Milton, the like of which were not\noften proclaimed in his generation. Here is ecstatic admiration of\nballads and of the Ossian imitations, all so unfashionable in the\nliterary culture of the day. While dates disprove Lowell's statement in\nhis essay on Gray that \"those anti-classical yearnings of Gray began\nafter he had ceased producing,\" it is certain that very little of his\npoetic work expressed these yearnings. \"Elegance, sweetness, pathos, or\neven majesty he could achieve, but never that force which vibrates in\nevery verse of larger moulded men.\" Change Lowell's word \"could\" to\n\"did,\" and this sentence will serve our purpose here.\n\nOur interest in Gray's Romanticism must confine itself to the two odes\nfrom the Old Norse. It is to be noted that the first transplanting to\nEnglish poetry of Old Norse song came about through the scholar's\nagency, not the poet's. It was Gray, the scholar, that made \"The Descent\nof Odin\" and \"The Fatal Sisters.\" They were intended to serve as\nspecimens of a forgotten literature in a history of English poetry. In\nthe \"Advertisement\" to \"The Fatal Sisters\" he tells how he came to give\nup the plan: \"The Author has long since drop'd his design, especially\nafter he heard, that it was already in the hands of a Person well\nqualified to do it justice, both by his taste, and his researches into\nantiquity.\" Thomas Warton's _History of English Poetry_ was the\nexecution of this design, but in that book no place was found for these\npoems.\n\nIn his absurd _Life of Gray_, Dr. Johnson said: \"His translations of\nNorthern and Welsh Poetry deserve praise: the imagery is preserved,\nperhaps often improved, but the language is unlike the language of other\npoets.\" There are more correct statements in this sentence, perhaps,\nthan in any other in the essay, but this is because ignorance sometimes\nhits the truth. It is not likely that the poems would have been\nunderstood without the preface and the explanatory notes, and these, in\na measure, made the reader interested in the literature from which they\nwere drawn. Gray called the pieces \"dreadful songs,\" and so in very\ntruth they are. Strength is the dominant note, rude, barbaric strength,\nand only the art of Gray saved it from condemnation. To-day, with so\nmany imitations from Old Norse to draw upon, we cannot point to a single\npoem which preserves spirit and form as well as those of Gray. Take the\nstanza:\n\n    Horror covers all the heath,\n      Clouds of carnage blot the sun,\n    Sisters, weave the web of death;\n      Sisters, cease, the work is done.\n\nThe strophe is perfect in every detail. Short lines, each ending a\nsentence; alliteration; words that echo the sense, and just four strokes\nto paint a picture which has an atmosphere that whisks you into its own\nworld incontinently. It is no wonder that writers of later days who have\ntried similar imitations ascribe to Thomas Gray the mastership.\n\nThat this poet of the eighteenth century, who \"equally despised what\nwas Greek and what was Gothic,\" should have entered so fully into the\nspirit and letter of Old Norse poetry is little short of marvelous. If\nProfessor G.L. Kittredge had not gone so minutely into the question of\nGray's knowledge of Old Norse,[3] we might be pardoned for still\nbelieving with Gosse[4] that the poet learned Icelandic in his later\nlife. Even after reading Professor Kittredge's essay, we cannot\nunderstand how Gray could catch the metrical lilt of the Old Norse with\nonly a Latin version to transliterate the parallel Icelandic. We suspect\nthat Gray's knowledge was fuller than Professor Kittredge will allow,\nalthough we must admit that superficial knowledge may coexist with a\nfine interpretative spirit. Matthew Arnold's knowledge of Celtic\nliterature was meagre, yet he wrote memorably and beautifully on that\nsubject, as Celts themselves will acknowledge.[5]\n\n\nTHE SOURCES OF GRAY'S KNOWLEDGE.\n\nIt has already been said that only antiquarians had knowledge of things\nIcelandic in Gray's time. Most of this knowledge was in Latin, of\ncourse, in ponderous tomes with wonderful, long titles; and the list of\nthem is awe-inspiring. In all likelihood Gray did not use them all, but\nhe met references to them in the books he did consult. Professor\nKittredge mentions them in the paper already quoted, but they are here\narranged in the order of publication, and the list is lengthened to\ninclude some books that were inspired by the interest in Gray's\nexperiments.\n\n=1636= and =1651=.

It is treated at length later on.\n\n\nSIR WILLIAM TEMPLE (1628-1699).\n\nFrom the above list it appears that the earliest mention in the English\nlanguage of Icelandic literature was Sir William Temple's. The two\nessays noted above have many references to Northern customs and songs.\nMacaulay's praise of Temple's style is well deserved, and the slighting\nremarks about the matter do not apply to the passages in evidence here.\nTemple's acknowledgments to Wormius indicate the source of his\ninformation, and it is a commentary upon the exactness of the\nantiquarian's knowledge that so many of the statements in Temple's\nessays are perfectly good to-day. Of course the terms \"Runic\" and\n\"Gothic\" were misused, but so were they a century later. Odin is \"the\nfirst and great hero of the western Scythians; he led a mighty swarm of\nthe Getes, under the name of Goths, from the Asiatic Scythia into the\nfarthest northwest parts of Europe; he seated and spread his kingdom\nround the whole Baltic sea, and over all the islands in it, and extended\nit westward to the ocean and southward to the Elve.\"[6] Temple places\nOdin's expedition at two thousand years before his own time, but he gets\nmany other facts right. Take this summing up of the old Norse belief as\nan example:\n\n\"An opinion was fixed and general among them, that death was but the\nentrance into another life; that all men who lived lazy and inactive\nlives, and died natural deaths, by sickness, or by age, went into vast\ncaves under ground, all dark and miry, full of noisom creatures, usual\nin such places, and there forever grovelled in endless stench and\nmisery. On the contrary, all who gave themselves to warlike actions and\nenterprises, to the conquests of their neighbors, and slaughters of\nenemies, and died in battle, or of violent deaths upon bold adventures\nor resolutions, they went immediately to the vast hall or palace of\nOdin, their god of war, who eternally kept open house for all such\nguests, where they were entertained at infinite tables, in perpetual\nfeasts and mirth, carousing every man in bowls made of the skulls of\ntheir enemies they had slain, according to which numbers, every one in\nthese mansions of pleasure was the most honoured and the best\nentertained.\"[7]\n\nThus before Gray was born, Temple had written intelligently in English\nof the salient features of the Old Norse mythology. Later in the same\nessay, he recognized that some of the civil and political procedures of\nhis country were traceable to the Northmen, and, what is more to our\nimmediate purpose, he recognized the poetic value of Old Norse song. On\np. 358 occurs this paragraph:\n\n\"I am deceived, if in this sonnet (two stanzas of 'Regner Lodbrog'), and\na following ode of Scallogrim there be not a vein truly poetical, and in\nits kind Pindaric, taking it with the allowance of the different\nclimates, fashions, opinions, and languages of such distant countries.\"\n\nTemple certainly had no knowledge of Old Norse, and yet, in 1679, he\ncould write so of a poem which he had to read through the Latin. Sir\nWilliam had a wide knowledge and a fine appreciation of literature, and\nan enthusiasm for its dissemination. He takes evident delight in telling\nthe fact that princes and kings of the olden time did high honor to\nbards. He regrets that classic culture was snuffed out by a barbarous\npeople, but he rejoices that a new kind came to take its place. \"Some of\nit wanted not the true spirit of poetry in some degree, or that natural\ninspiration which has been said to arise from some spark of poetical\nfire wherewith particular men are born; and such as it was, it served\nthe turn, not only to please, but even to charm, the ignorant and\nbarbarous vulgar, where it was in use.\"[8]\n\nIt is proverbial that music hath charms to soothe the savage breast.\nThat savage music charms cultivated minds is not proverbial, but it is\nnevertheless true. Here is Sir William Temple, scion of a cultured race,\nbearing witness to the fact, and here is Gray, a life-long dweller in a\nstaid English university, endorsing it a half century later. As has been\nintimated, this was unusual in the time in which they lived, when, in\nLowell's phrase, the \"blight of propriety\" was on all poetry. But it was\nonly the rude and savage in an unfamiliar literature that could give\npause in the age of Pope. The milder aspects of Old Norse song and saga\nmust await the stronger century to give them favor. \"Behold, there was a\nswarm of bees and honey in the carcass of the lion.\"\n\n\nGEORGE HICKES (1642-1715).\n\nThe next book in the list that contains an English contribution to the\nknowledge of our subject is the _Thesaurus_ of George Hickes. On p. 193\nof Part I, there is a prose translation of \"The Awakening of Angantyr,\"\nfrom the _Harvarar Saga_. Acknowledgment is given to Verelius for the\ntext of the poem, but Hickes seems to have chosen this poem as the gem\nof the Saga. The translation is another proof of an antiquarian's taste\nand judgment, and the reader does not wonder that it soon found a wider\naudience through another publication. It was reprinted in the books of\n1716 and 1770 in the above list. An extract or two will show that the\nvigor of the old poem has not been altogether lost in the translation:\n\n_Hervor_.--Awake Angantyr, Hervor the only daughter of thee and Suafu\ndoth awaken thee. Give me out of the tombe, the hardned[9] sword, which\nthe dwarfs made for Suafurlama. Hervardur, Hiorvardur, Hrani, and\nAngantyr, with helmet, and coat of mail, and a sharp sword, with sheild\nand accoutrements, and bloody spear, I wake you all, under the roots of\ntrees. Are the sons of Andgrym, who delighted in mischief, now become\ndust and ashes, can none of Eyvors sons now speak with me out of the\nhabitations of the dead! Harvardur, Hiorvardur! so may you all be within\nyour ribs, as a thing that is hanged up to putrifie among insects,\nunlesse you deliver me the sword which the dwarfs made ... and the\nglorious belt.\n\n_Angantyr_.--Daughter Hervor, full of spells to raise the dead, why\ndost thou call so? wilt thou run on to thy own mischief? thou art mad,\nand out of thy senses, who art desperatly resolved to waken dead men. I\nwas not buried either by father or other freinds. Two which lived after\nme got Tirfing, one of whome is now possessor thereof.\n\n_Hervor_.--Thou dost not tell the truth: so let Odin hide thee in the\ntombe, as thou hast Tirfing by thee. Art thou unwilling, Angantyr, to\ngive an inheritance to thy only child?...\n\n_Angantyr_.--Fals woman, thou dost not understand, that thou speakest\nfoolishly of that, in which thou dost rejoice, for Tirfing shall, if\nthou wilt beleive me, maid, destroy all thy offspring.\n\n_Hervor_.--I must go to my seamen, here I have no mind to stay longer.\nLittle do I care, O Royall friend, what my sons hereafter quarrell\nabout.\n\n_Angantyr_.--Take and keep Hialmars bane, which thou shalt long have and\nenjoy, touch but the edges of it, there is poyson in both of them, it is\na most cruell devourer of men.\n\n_Hervor_.--I shall keep, and take in hand, the sharp sword which thou\nhast let me have: I do not fear, O slain father! what my sons hereafter\nmay quarrell about.... Dwell all of you safe in the tombe, I must be\ngon, and hasten hence, for I seem to be, in the midst of a place where\nfire burns round about me.\n\nOne can well understand, who handles the ponderous _Thesaurus_, why the\nfirst English lovers of Old Norse were antiquarians. \"The Awakening of\nAngantyr\" is literally buried in this work, and only the student of\nAnglo-Saxon prosody would come upon it unassisted, since it is an\nillustration in a chapter of the _Grammaticæ Anglo-Saxonicæ et\nMoeso-Gothicæ_. Students will remember in this connection that it was\na work on poetics that saved for us the original Icelandic _Edda_. The\nIcelandic skald had to know his nation's mythology.\n\n\nTHOMAS PERCY (1729-1811).\n\nThe title of Chapter XXIII in Hickes' work indicates that even among\nlearned doctors mistaken notions existed as to the relationship of the\nTeutonic languages. It took more than a hundred years to set the error\nright, but in the meanwhile the literature of Iceland was becoming\nbetter known to English readers. To the French scholar, Paul Henri\nMallet (1730-1807), Europe owes the first popular presentation of\nNorthern antiquities and literature. Appointed professor of\nbelles-lettres in the Copenhagen academy he found himself with more time\nthan students on his hands, because not many Danes at that time\nunderstood French. His leisure time was applied to the study of the\nantiquities of his adopted country, the King's commission for a history\nof Denmark making that necessary. As a preface to this work he\npublished, in 1755, an _Introduction a l'Histoire de Dannemarc où l'on\ntraite de la Réligion, des Lois, des Moeurs et des Usages des Anciens\nDanois_, and, in 1756, the work in the list on a previous page. In this\nsecond book was the first translation into a modern tongue of the\n_Edda_, and this volume, in consequence, attracted much attention. The\ngreat English antiquarian, Thomas Percy, afterward Bishop of Dromore,\nwas early drawn to this work, and with the aid of friends he\naccomplished a translation of it, which was published in 1770.\n\nMallet's work was very bad in its account of the racial affinities of\nthe nations commonly referred to as the barbarians that overturned the\nRoman empire and culture. Percy, who had failed to edit the ballad MSS.\nso as to please Ritson, was wise enough to see Mallet's error, and to\ninsist that Celtic and Gothic antiquities must not be confounded.\nMallet's translation of the _Edda_ was imperfect, too, because he had\nfollowed the Latin version of Resenius, which was notoriously poor.\nPercy's _Edda_ was no better, because it was only an English version of\nMallet. But we are not concerned with these critical considerations\nhere; and so it will be enough to record the fact that with the\npublication of Percy's _Northern Antiquities_--the English name of\nMallet's work--in 1770, knowledge of Icelandic literature passed from\nthe exclusive control of learned antiquarians. More and more, as time\nwent on, men went to the Icelandic originals, and translations of poems\nand sagas came from the press in increasing numbers. In the course of\ntime came original works that were inspired by Old Norse stories and Old\nNorse conceptions.\n\nWe have already noted that Gray's poems on Icelandic themes, though\nwritten in 1761, were not published until 1768. Another delayed work on\nsimilar themes was Percy's _Five Pieces of Runic Poetry_, which, the\nauthor tells us, was prepared for the press in 1761, but, through an\naccident, was not published until 1763. The preface has this interesting\nsentence: \"It would be as vain to deny, as it is perhaps impolitic to\nmention, that this attempt is owing to the success of the Erse\nfragments.\" The book has an appendix containing the Icelandic originals\nof the poems translated, and that portion of the book shows that a\nscholar's hand and interest made the volume. So, too, does the close of\nthe preface: \"That the study of ancient northern literature hath its\nimportant uses has been often evinced by able writers: and that it is\nnot dry or unamusive this little work it is hoped will demonstrate. Its\naim at least is to shew, that if those kind of studies are not always\nemployed on works of taste or classic elegance, they serve at least to\nunlock the treasures of native genius; they present us with frequent\nsallies of bold imagination, and constantly afford matter for\nphilosophical reflection by showing the workings of the human mind in\nits almost original state of nature.\"\n\nThat original state was certainly one of original sin, if these poems\nare to be believed. Every page in this volume is drenched with blood,\nand from this book, as from Gray's poems and the other Old Norse\nimitations of the time, a picture of fierceness and fearfulness was the\nonly one possible. Percy intimates in his preface that Icelandic poetry\nhas other tales to tell besides the \"Incantation of Hervor,\" the \"Dying\nOde of Regner Lodbrog,\" the \"Ransome of Egill the Scald,\" and the\n\"Funeral Song of Hacon,\" which are here set down; he offers the\n\"Complaint of Harold\" as a slight indication that the old poets left\n\"behind them many pieces on the gentler subjects of love or friendship.\"\nBut the time had not come for the presentation of those pieces.\n\nAll of these translations were from the Latin versions extant in Percy's\ntime. This volume copied Hickes's translation of \"Hervor's Incantation\"\nmodified in a few particulars, and like that one, the other translations\nin this volume were in prose. The work is done as well as possible, and\nit remained for later scholars to point out errors in translation. The\nnegative contractions in Icelandic were as yet unfamiliar, and so, as\nWalter Scott pointed out (in _Edin. Rev._, Oct., 1806), Percy made\nRegner Lodbrog say, \"The pleasure of that day (of battle, p. 34 in this\n_Five Pieces_) was like having a fair virgin placed beside one in the\nbed,\" and \"The pleasure of that day was like kissing a young widow at\nthe highest seat of the table,\" when the poet really made the contrary\nstatement.\n\nOf course, the value of this book depends upon the view that is taken of\nit. Intrinsically, as literature, it is well-nigh valueless. It\nindicates to us, however, a constantly growing interest in the\nliterature it reveals, and it undoubtedly directed the attention of the\npoets of the succeeding generation to a field rich in romantic\npossibilities. That no great work was then created out of this material\nwas not due to neglect. As we shall see, many puny poets strove to\nbreathe life into these bones, but the divine power was not in the\npoets. Some who were not poets had yet the insight to feel the value of\nthis ancient literature, and they made known the facts concerning it. It\nseems a mechanical and unpromising way to have great poetry written,\nthis calling out, \"New Lamps for Old.\" Yet it is on record that great\npoems have been written at just such instigation.\n\n\nTHOMAS WARTON (1728-1790).\n\nHistorians[10] of Romanticism have marked Warton's _History of English\nPoetry_ as one of the forces that made for the new idea in literature.\nThis record of a past which, though out of favor, was immeasurably\nsuperior to the time of its historian, spread new views concerning the\npoetic art among the rising generation, and suggested new subjects as\nwell as new treatments of old subjects. We have mentioned the fact that\nGray handed over to Warton his notes for a contemplated history of\npoetry, and that Warton found no place in his work for Gray's\nadaptations from the Old Norse. Warton was not blind to the beauties of\nGray's poems, nor did he fail to appreciate the merits of the literature\nwhich they illustrated. His scheme relegated his remarks concerning that\npoetry to the introductory dissertation, \"Of the Origin of Romantic\nFiction in Europe.\" What he had to say was in support of a theory which\nis not accepted to-day, and of course his statements concerning the\norigin of the Scandinavian people were as wrong as those that we found\nin Mallet and Temple. But with all his misinformation, Warton managed to\nget at many truths about Icelandic poetry, and his presentation of them\nwas fresh and stimulating. Already the Old Norse mythology was well\nknown, even down to Valhalla and the mistletoe. Old Norse poetry was\nwell enough known to call forth this remark:\n\n\"They (the 'Runic' odes) have a certain sublime and figurative cast of\ndiction, which is indeed one of their predominant characteristics....\nWhen obvious terms and phrases evidently occurred, the Runic poets are\nfond of departing from the common and established diction. They appear\nto use circumlocution and comparisons not as a matter of necessity, but\nof choice and skill: nor are these metaphorical colourings so much the\nresult of want of words, as of warmth of fancy.\" The note gives these\nexamples: \"Thus, a rainbow is called, the bridge of the gods. Poetry,\nthe mead of Odin. The earth, the vessel that floats on ages. A ship, the\nhorse of the waves. A tongue, the sword of words. Night, the veil of\ncares.\"\n\nA study of the notes to Warton's dissertation reveals the fact that he\nhad made use of the books already mentioned in the list on a previous\npage, and of no others that are significant. But such excellent use was\nmade of them, that it would seem as if nothing was left in them that\ncould be made valuable for spreading a knowledge of and an enthusiasm\nfor Icelandic literature. When it is remembered that Warton's purpose\nwas to prove the Saracenic origin of romantic fiction in Europe, through\nthe Moors in Spain, and that Icelandic literature was mentioned only to\naccount for a certain un-Arabian tinge in that romantic fiction, the\nwonder grows that so full and fresh a presentation of Old Norse poetry\nshould have been made. He puts such passages as these into his\nillustrative notes: \"Tell my mother Suanhita in Denmark, that she will\nnot this summer comb the hair of her son. I had promised her to return,\nbut now my side shall feel the edge of the sword.\" There is an\nappreciation of the poetic here, that makes us feel that Warton was not\nan unworthy wearer of the laurel. He insists that the Saxon poetry was\npowerfully affected by \"the old scaldic fables and heroes,\" and gives in\nthe text a translation of the \"Battle of Brunenburgh\" to prove his\ncase. He admires \"the scaldic dialogue at the tomb of Angantyr,\" but\nwrongly attributes a beautiful translation of it to Gray. He quotes at\nlength from \"a noble ode, called in the northern chronicles the Elogium\nof Hacon, by the scald Eyvynd; who, for his superior skill in poetry was\ncalled the Cross of Poets (Eyvindr Skálldaspillir), and fought in the\nbattle which he celebrated.\"\n\nHe knows how Iceland touched England, as this passage will show: \"That\nthe Icelandic bards were common in England during the Danish invasions,\nthere are numerous proofs. Egill, a celebrated Icelandic poet, having\nmurthered the son and many of the friends of Eric Blodaxe, king of\nDenmark or Norway, then residing in Northumberland, and which he had\njust conquered, procured a pardon by singing before the king, at the\ncommand of his queen Gunhilde, an extemporaneous ode. Egill compliments\nthe king, who probably was his patron, with the appellation of the\nEnglish chief. 'I offer my freight to the king. I owe a poem for my\nransom. I present to the ENGLISH CHIEF the mead of Odin.' Afterwards he\ncalls this Danish conqueror the commander of the Scottish fleet. 'The\ncommander of the Scottish fleet fattened the ravenous birds. The sister\nof Nera (Death) trampled on the foe: she trampled on the evening food of\nthe eagle.'\"\n\nSo wide a knowledge and so keen an appreciation of Old Norse in a\nWarton, whose interest was chiefly elsewhere, argues for a spreading\npopularity of the ancient literature. Thus far, only Gray has made\nliving English literature out of these old stories, and he only two\nshort poems. There were other attempts to achieve poetic success with\nthis foreign material, but a hundred exacting years have covered them\nwith oblivion.\n\n\nDRAKE (1766-1836). MATHIAS (1754-1835).\n\nIn the second decade of the nineteenth century, Nathan Drake, M.D., made\na strong effort to popularize Norse mythology and literature. The fourth\nedition of his work entitled _Literary Hours_ (London, 1820)\ncontains[11] an appreciative article on the subject, the fullness of\nwhich is indicated in these words from p. 309:\n\n\"The most striking and characteristic parts of the Scandinavian\nmythology, together with no inconsiderable portion of the manners and\ncustoms of our northern ancestors, have now passed before the reader;\ntheir theology, warfare, and poetry, their gallantry, religious rites,\nand superstitions, have been separately, and, I trust, distinctly\nreviewed.\"\n\n\nThe essay is written in an easy style that doubtless gained for it many\nreaders. All the available knowledge of the subject was used, and a\nclearer view of it was presented than had been obtainable in Percy's\n\"Mallet.\" The author was a thoughtful man, able to detect errors in\nWarton and Percy, but his zeal in his enterprise led him to praise\nversifiers inordinately that had used the \"Gothic fables.\" He quotes\nliberally from writers whose books are not to be had in this country,\nand certainly the uninspired verses merit the neglect that this fact\nindicates. He calls Sayers' pen \"masterly\" that wrote these lines:\n\n    Coucher of the ponderous spear,\n      Thou shout'st amid the battle's stound--\n    The armed Sisters hear,\n      Viewless hurrying o'er the ground\n    They strike the destin'd chiefs and call them to the skies.\n\n(P. 168.)\n\nFrom Penrose he quotes such lines as these:\n\n      The feast begins, the skull goes round,\n    Laughter shouts--the shouts resound.\n    The gust of war subsides--E'en now\n      The grim chief curls his cheek, and smooths his rugged brow.\n\n(P. 171.)\n\nFrom Sterling comes this imitation of Gray:\n\n    Now the rage of combat burns,\n      Haughty chiefs on chiefs lie slain;\n    The battle glows and sinks by turns,\n      Death and carnage load the plain.\n\n(P 172.)\n\nFrom these extracts, it appears that the poets who imitated Gray\nconsidered that only \"dreadful songs,\" like his, were to be found in\nScandinavian poetry.\n\nDownman, Herbert and Mathias are also adduced by Dr. Drake as examples\nof poets who have gained much by Old Norse borrowings, but these\nborrowings are invariably scenes from a chamber of horrors. It occurs\nto me that perhaps Dr. Drake had begun to tire of the spiritless echoes\nof the classical schools, and that he fondly hoped that such shrieks and\ngroans as those he admired in this essay would satisfy his cravings for\nbetter things in poetry. But the critic had no adequate knowledge of the\nway in which genius works. His one desire in these studies of\nScandinavian mythology was \"to recommend it to the votaries of the Muse,\nas a machinery admirably constructed for their purpose\" (p. 158). He\nhopes for \"a more extensive adoption of the Scandinavian mythology,\nespecially in our _epic_ and _lyric_ compositions\" (p. 311). We smile at\nthe notion, to-day, but that very conception of poetry as \"machinery\" is\ncharacteristic of a whole century of our English literature.\n\nThe Mathias mentioned by Drake is Thomas James Mathias, whose book,\n_Odes Chiefly from the Norse Tongue_ (London, 1781), received the\ndistinction of an American reprint (New York, 1806). Bartholinus\nfurnishes the material and Gray the spirit for these pieces.\n\n\nAMOS S. COTTLE(1768-1800). WILLIAM HERBERT (1778-1847).\n\nIn this period belong two works of translation that mark the approach of\nthe time when Old Norse prose and poetry were to be read in the\noriginal. As literature they are of little value, and they had but\nslight influence on succeeding writers.\n\nAt Bristol, in 1797, was published _Icelandic Poetry, or, The Edda of\nSaemund translated into English Verse_, by A.S. Cottle of Magdalen\nCollege, Cambridge. This work has an Introduction containing nothing\nworth discussing here, and an \"Epistle\" to A.S. Cottle from Robert\nSouthey. The laureate, in good blank verse, discourses on the Old Norse\nheroes whom he happens to know about. They are the old favorites, Regner\nLodbrog and his sons; in Southey's poem the foeman's skull is, as usual,\nthe drinking cup. It was certainly time for new actors and new\nproperties to appear in English versions of Scandinavian stories.\n\nThe translations are twelve in number, and evince an intelligent and\nfacile versifier. When all is said, these old songs could contribute to\nthe pleasure of very few. Only a student of history, or a poet, or an\nantiquarian, would dwell with loving interest on the lays of\nVafthrudnis, Grimner, Skirner and Hymer (as Cottle spells them).\nBesides, they are difficult to read, and must be abundantly annotated to\nmake them comprehensible. In such works as this of Cottle, a Scott might\nfind wherewith to lend color to a story or a poem, but the common man\nwould borrow Walpole's words, used in characterizing Gray's \"Odes\":\n\"They are not interesting, and do not ... touch any passion; our human\nfeelings ... are not here affected. Who can care through what horrors a\nRunic savage arrived at all the joys and glories they could\nconceive--the supreme felicity of boozing ale out of the skull of an\nenemy in Odin's hall?\"[12]\n\nIn 1804 a book was published bearing this title-page: _Select Icelandic\nPoetry, translated from the originals: with notes_. The preface was\nsigned by the author, William Herbert. The pieces are from Sæmund,\nBartholinus, Verelius, and Perinskjöld's edition of _Heimskringla_, and\nwere all translated with the assistance of the Latin versions. The notes\nare explanatory of the allusions and the hiatuses in the poems.\nReference is made to MSS. of the Norse pieces existing in museums and\nlibraries, which the author had consulted. Thus we see scholarship\nbeginning to extend investigations. As for the verses themselves not\nmuch need be said. They are not so good as Cottle's, although they\nreceived a notice from Scott in the _Edinburgh Review_. The thing to\nnotice about the work is that it pretends to come direct from Old Norse,\nnot, as most of the work dealt with so far, _via_ Latin.\n\nIcelandic poetry is more difficult to read than Icelandic prose, and so\nit seems strange that the former should have been attacked first by\nEnglish scholars. Yet so it was, and until 1844 our English literature\nhad no other inspiration in old Norse writings than the rude and rugged\nsongs that first lent their lilt to Gray. The _human_ North is in the\nsagas, and when they were revealed to our people, Icelandic literature\nbegan to mean something more than Valhalla and the mead-bouts there. The\nscene was changed to earth, and the gods gave place to nobler actors,\nmen and women. The action was lifted to the eminence of a world-drama.\nBut before the change came Sir Walter Scott, and it is fitting that the\nfirst period of Norse influence in English literature should close, as\nit began, with a great master.\n\n\nSIR WALTER SCOTT (1771-1832).\n\nIn 1792, Walter Scott was twenty-one years old, and one of his\nnote-books of that year contains this entry: \"Vegtam's Kvitha or The\nDescent of Odin, with the Latin of Thomas Bartholine, and the English\npoetical version of Mr. Gray; with some account of the Death of Balder,\nboth as related in the Edda, and as handed down to us by the Northern\nhistorians--_Auctore Gualtero Scott_.\" According to Lockhart,[13] the\nIcelandic, Latin and English versions were here transcribed, and the\nhistorical account that followed--seven closely written quarto\npages--was read before a debating society.\n\nIt was to be expected that one so enthusiastic about antiquities as\nScott would early discover the treasury of Norse history and song. At\ntwenty-one, as we see, he is transcribing a song in a language he knew\nnothing about, as well as in translations. Fourteen years later, he has\nlearned enough about the subject to write a review of Herbert's _Poems\nand Translations_.[14]\n\nIn 1813, he writes an account of the _Eyrbyggja Saga_ for _Illustrations\nof Northern Antiquities_ (edited by Robert Jameson, Edinburgh, 1814).\n\nThere are two of Scott's contributions to literature that possess more\nthan a mere tinge of Old Norse knowledge, namely, the long poem \"Harold,\nthe Dauntless\" (published in 1817), and the long story \"The Pirate\"\n(published in 1821). The poem is weak, but it illustrates Scott's theory\nof the usefulness of poetical antiquities to the modern poet. In another\nconnection Scott said: \"In the rude song of the Scald, we regard less\nthe strained imagery and extravagance of epithet, than the wild\nimpressions which it conveys of the dauntless resolution, savage\nsuperstition, rude festivity and ceaseless depredations of the ancient\nScandinavians.\"[15] The poet did his work in accordance with this\ntheory, and so in \"Harold, the Dauntless,\" we note no flavor of the\nolder poetry in phrase or in method. Harold is fierce enough and grim\nenough to measure up to the old ideal of a Norse hero.\n\n\"I was rocked in a buckler and fed from a blade,\" is his boast before\nhis newly christened father, and in his apostrophe to his grandsire\nEric, the popular notion of early Norse antiquarianism is again\nexhibited:\n\n    In wild Valhalla hast thou quaffed\n    From foeman's skull metheglin draught?\n\nScott's scholarship in Old Norse was largely derived from the Latin\ntomes, and such conceptions as those quoted are therefore common in his\npoem. That the poet realized the inadequacy of such knowledge, the\nreview of Herbert's poetry, published in the _Edinburgh Review_ for\nOctober, 1806, shows. In this article he has a vision of what shall be\nwhen men shall be able \"to trace the Runic rhyme\" itself.\n\n\"The Pirate,\" exhibited the Wizard's skill in weaving the old and the\nnew together, the old being the traditions of the Shetlands, full of the\nancestral beliefs in Old Norse things, the new being the life in those\nislands in a recent century. This is a stirring story, that comes into\nour consideration because of its Scandinavian antiquities. Again we find\nthe Latin treasuries of Bartholinus, Torfæus, Perinskjöld and Olaus\nMagnus in evidence, though here, too, mention is made of \"Haco,\" and\nTryggvason and \"Harfager.\" With a background of island scenery, with\nwhich Scott became familiar during a light-house inspector's voyage made\nin 1814, this story is a picture full of vivid colors and characters. In\nNorna of the Fitful Head, he has created a mysterious personage in whose\nmouth \"Runic rhymes\" are the only proper speech. She stills the tempest\nwith them, and \"The Song of the Tempest\" is a strong apostrophe, though\nit is neither Runic nor rhymed. She preludes her life-story with verses\nthat are rhymed but not Runic, and she sings incantations in the same\nwise. This _Reimkennar_ is an echo of the _Völuspá_, and is the only\nkind of Norse woman that the time of Scott could imagine. Claud Halcro,\nthe poet, is fond of rhyming the only kind of Norseman known to his\ntime, and in his \"Song of Harold Harfager\" we hear the echoes of Gray's\nodes. Scott's reading was wide in all ancient lore, and he never missed\na chance to introduce an odd custom if it would make an interesting\nscene in his story. So here we have the \"Sword Dance\" (celebrated by\nOlaus Magnus, though I have never read of it in Old Norse), the\n\"Questioning of the Sibyl\" (like that in Gray's \"Descent of Odin\"), the\n\"Capture and Sharing of the Whale,\" and the \"Promise of Odin.\" In most\nof the natives there are turns of speech that recall the Norse ancestry\nof the Shetlanders.\n\nIn Scott, then, we see the lengthening out of the influence of the\nantiquarians who wrote of a dead past in a dead language. The time was\nat hand when that past was to live again, painted in the living words of\nliving men.\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\nFROM THE SOURCES THEMSELVES.\n\n\nIn the preceding section we noted the achievements of English\nscholarship and genius working under great disadvantages. Gray and Scott\nmay have had a smattering of Icelandic, but Latin translations were\nnecessary to reveal the meaning of what few Old Norse texts were\navailable to them. This paucity of material, more than the ignorance of\nthe language, was responsible for the slow progress in popularizing the\nremarkable literature of the North. Scaldic and Eddie poems comprised\nall that was known to English readers of that literature, and in them\nthe superhuman rather than the human elements were predominant.\n\nWe have come now to a time when the field of our view broadens to\ninclude not only more and different material, but more and different\nmen. The sagas were annexed to the old songs, and the body of literature\nto attract attention was thus increased a thousand fold. The\nantiquarians were supplanted by scholars who, although passionately\ndevoted to the study of the past, were still vitally interested in the\naffairs of the time in which they lived. The second and greatest stage\nof the development of Old Norse influence in England has a mark of\ndistinction that belongs to few literary epochs. The men who made it\nlived lives that were as heroic in devotion to duty and principle as\nmany of those written down in the sagas themselves. I have sometimes\nwondered whether it is merely accidental that English saga scholars were\nso often men of high soul and strong action. Certain it is that Richard\nCleasby, and Samuel Laing, and George Webbe Dasent, and Robert Lowe are\ntypes of men that the Icelanders would have celebrated, as having \"left\na tale to tell\" in their full and active lives. And no less certain is\nit that Thomas Carlyle, and Matthew Arnold, and William Morris, and\nCharles Kingsley, and Gerald Massey labored for a better manhood that\nshould rise to the stature and reflect the virtues of the heroes of the\nNorthland.\n\nRICHARD CLEASBY (1797-1847).\n\nIn the forties of the nineteenth century several minds began to work,\nindependently of one another, in this wider field of Icelandic\nliterature. Richard Cleasby (1797-1847), an English merchant's son with\nscholarly instincts, began the study of the sagas, but made slight\nprogress because of what he called an \"unaccountable and most scandalous\nblank,\" the want of a dictionary. This was in 1840, and for the next\nseven years he labored to fill up that blank. The record[16] of those\nyears is a wonderful witness to the heroism and spirit of the scholar,\nand justifies Sir George Dasent's characterization of Cleasby as \"one of\nthe most indefatigable students that ever lived.\" The work thus begun\nwas not completed until many years afterward (it is dated 1874), and, by\nuntoward circumstances, very little of it is Richard Cleasby's. But\ngenerous scholarship acknowledged its debt to the man who gave his\nstrength and his wealth to the work, by placing his name on the\ntitle-page. No less shall we fail to honor his memory by mentioning his\nlabors here. Although the dictionary was not completed in the decade of\nits inception, the study that it was designed to promote took hold on a\nnumber of men and the results were remarkable for both literature and\nscholarship.\n\n\nTHOMAS CARLYLE (1795-1881).\n\nFirst in order of time was the work of Thomas Carlyle. It will not seem\nstrange to the student of English literature to find that this writer\ncame under the influence of the old skalds and sagaman and spoke\nappreciative words concerning them. His German studies had to take\ncognizance of the Old Norse treasuries of poetry, and he became a\ndiligent reader of Icelandic literature in what translations he could\nget at, German and English. The strongest utterance on the subject that\nhe left behind him is in \"Lecture I\" of the series \"On Heroes,\nHero-Worship, and the Heroic in History,\" dated May, 1840. This is a\ntreatment of Scandinavian mythology, rugged and thorough, like all of\nthis man's work. Carlyle evinces a scholar's instinct in more than one\nplace, as, for instance, when he doubts the _grandmother_ etymology of\n_Edda_, an etymology repeated until a much later day by scholars of a\nless sure sense.[17] But this lecture \"On Heroes\" is also a\nglorification of the literature with which we are dealing, and in this\nregard it is worthy of special note here.\n\nIn the first place, Carlyle with true critical instinct caught the\nessence of it; to him it seemed to have \"a rude childlike way of\nrecognizing the divineness of Nature, the divineness of Man.\" For him\nScandinavian mythology was superior in sincerity to the Grecian, though\nit lacked the grace of the latter. \"Sincerity, I think, is better than\ngrace. I feel that these old Northmen were looking into Nature with open\neye and soul: most earnest, honest; childlike, and yet manlike; with a\ngreat-hearted simplicity and depth and freshness, in a true, loving,\nadmiring, unfearing way. A right valiant, true old race of men.\" This is\na truer appreciation than Gray and Walpole had, eighty years before. In\nthe second place, Carlyle was not misled into thinking that valor in war\nwas the only characteristic of the rude Norseman, and skill in drinking\nhis only household virtue. \"Beautiful traits of pity, too, and honest\npity.\" Then he tells of Baldur and Nanna, in his rugged prose account\nanticipating Matthew Arnold. Other qualities of the literature appeal to\nhim. \"I like much their robust simplicity; their veracity, directness of\nconception. Thor 'draws down his brows' in a veritable Norse rage;\n'grasps his hammer till the _knuckles grow white_.\" Again; \"A great\nbroad Brobdignag grin of true humor is this Skrymir; mirth resting on\nearnestness and sadness, as the rainbow on the black tempest: only a\nright valiant heart is capable of that.\" Still again: \"This law of\nmutation, which also is a law written in man's inmost thought, has been\ndeciphered by these old earnest Thinkers in their rude style.\"\n\nThomas Carlyle, seeking to explain the worship of a pagan divinity,\nchose Odin as the noblest example of such a hero. The picture of Odin he\ndrew from the prose Edda, mainly, and his purpose required that he\npaint the picture in the most attractive colors. So it happened that our\nEnglish literature got its first _complete_ view of Old Norse ethics and\nart. The memory of Gray's \"dreadful songs\" had ruled for almost a\ncentury, and ordinary readers might be pardoned for thinking that Old\nNorse literature, like Old Norse history, was written in blood. We have\nseen that Gray's imitators perpetuated the old idea, and that even Scott\nsanctioned it, and now we see England's emancipation from it. The grouty\nold Scotchman of Craigenputtoch knew no more Icelandic than most of his\nfellow countrymen (be it noted that he said: \"From the Humber upwards,\nall over Scotland, the speech of the common people is still in a\nsingular degree Icelandic, its Germanism has still a peculiar Norse\ntinge\"); but he saw far more deeply into the heart of Icelandic\nliterature than anybody before him. His emphasis of its many sidedness,\nof its sincerity, its humanity, its simplicity, its directness, its\nhumor and its wisdom, was the signal for a change in the popular\nestimation of its worth to our modern art. Since his day we have had\nMorris and Arnold and a host of minor singers, and the nineteenth\ncentury revival of interest in Old Norse literature.\n\nThe other work by Carlyle dealing directly with Old Norse material is\n_The Early Kings of Norway_. Here he digests _Heimskringla_, which was\nobtainable through Laing's translation, in a way to stir the blood. The\nstory, as he tells it, is breathlessly interesting, and it is a pity\nthat readers of Carlyle so often stop short of this work. As in the\n_Hero-Worship_, he shows this Teutonic bias, and the religious training\nthat minified Greek literature.\n\nSnorri's work elicits from him repeated applause. Here, for instance, in\nChap. X: \"It has, all of it, the description (and we see clearly the\nfact itself had), a kind of pathetic grandeur, simplicity, and rude\nnobleness; something Epic or Homeric, without the metre or the singing\nof Homer, but with all the sincerity, rugged truth to nature, and much\nmore of piety, devoutness, reverence for what is ever high in this\nuniverse, than meets us in those old Greek Ballad-mongers.\"\n\nSAMUEL LAING (1780-1868).\n\nIt was the work of Samuel Laing that gave Carlyle the material for this\nlast-mentioned book.[18] Laing's translation of _Heimskringla_ bears the\ndate 1844, and although Mr. Dasent's quaint version of the _Prose Edda_\npreceded it by two years, _The Sagas of the Norse Kings_ was the\n\"epoch-making\" book. It is true that a later version has superseded it\nin literary and scholarly finish, but Laing's work was a pioneer of\nsterling intrinsic value, and many there be that do it homage still.\nLaing had the laudable ambition--so seldom found in these days--\"to give\na plain, faithful translation into English of the _Heimskringla_,\nunencumbered with antiquarian research, and suited to the plain English\nreader.\"[19] With this work, then, Icelandic lore passes out of the\nhands of the antiquarian into the hands of common readers. It matters\nlittle that the audience is even still fit and few; from this time on he\nthat runs may read.\n\nFor our purpose it will not be necessary to characterize the\ntranslation. Laing commanded an excellent style, and he was enthusiastic\nover his work. Indeed, the commonest criticism passed on the\n\"Preliminary Dissertation\" was that the author's zeal had run away with\nhis good sense. Be that as it may, Laing called the attention of his\nreaders to the neglect of a literature and a history which should be\nEngland's pride, as Anglo-Saxon literature and history even then were.\nThe reviews of the time made it appear as if another Battle of the Books\nwere impending--Anglo-Saxon versus Icelandic; a writer in the _English\nReview_ (Vol. 82, p. 316), pro-Saxon in his zeal, admitting at last that\n\"of none of the children of the Norse, whether Goth or Frank, Saxon or\nScandinavian, have the others any reason to be ashamed. All have earned\nthe gratitude and admiration of the world, and their combined or\nsuccessive efforts have made England and Europe what they are.\"\n\nIt is refreshing to come upon new views of Old Norse character, that\nrecognize \"amidst anarchy and bloodshed, redeeming features of\nkindliness and better feeling which tell of the mingled principles that\nwar within our nature for the mastery.\" Laing's translation accomplished\nthis for English readers, and with the years came a deeper knowledge\nthat showed those touches of tenderness and traits of beauty which, even\nin 1844, were not perceptible to those readers.\n\n\nHENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW (1807-1882).\n\nJAMES RUSSELL LOWELL (1819-1891).\n\n_The Story of the Norse Kings_, thus translated by an Englishman,\nsuggested to our American poet, Longfellow, a series of lyrics on King\nOlaf. The young college professor that wrote about _Frithjof's Saga_ in\nthe _North American Review_ for 1837, was bound, sooner or later, to\ncome back to the field when he found that the American reading public\nwould listen to whatever songs he sang to them. Before 1850, Longfellow\nhad written \"The Challenge of Thor,\" a poem which imitated the form of\nIcelandic verse and catches much of its spirit. In 1859, the thought\ncame to him \"that a very good poem might be written on the Saga of King\nOlaf, who converted the North to Christianity.\" Two years later he\ncompleted the lyrics that compose \"The Musician's Tale\" in _The Tales of\na Wayside Inn_, published in 1863, and in this work \"The Challenge of\nThor\" serves as a prelude. The pieces after this prelude are not\nimitations of the Icelandic verse, but are like Tegner's _Frithjof's\nSaga_, in that each new portion has a meter of its own. There is not,\neither, a consistent effort to put the flavor of the North into the\npoetry, so that, properly speaking, we have here only the retelling of\nan old tale. The ballad fervor and movement are often perceptible,\nthough nowhere does the poet strike the ringing note of \"The Skeleton in\nArmor,\" published in the volume of 1841.\n\nTruth to tell, Longfellow's \"Saga of King Olaf\" is not a remarkable\nwork. One who reads the few chapters in Carlyle's _Early Kings of\nNorway_ that deal with Olaf Tryggvason gets more of the fire and spirit\nof the old saga at every turning. The poet chooses scenes and incidents\nvery skilfully, but for their proper presentation a terseness is\nnecessary that is not reconcilable with frequent rhymes. Compare the\nsaga account with the poem's: \"What is this that has broken?\" asked King\nOlaf. \"Norway from thy hand, King,\" answered Tamberskelver.\n\n    \"What was that?\" said Olaf, standing\n      On the quarter deck.\n    \"Something heard I like the stranding\n      Of a shattered wreck.\"\n    Einar then, the arrow taking\n      From the loosened string,\n    Answered, \"That was Norway breaking\n      From thy hand, O King!\"\n\nNevertheless, Longfellow is to be thanked for acquainting a wide circle\nof readers with the sterling saga literature.\n\nOne other American poet was busy with the ancient Northern literature at\nthis time. James Russell Lowell wrote one notable poem that is Old Norse\nin subject and spirit, \"The Voyage to Vinland.\" The third part of the\npoem, \"Gudrida's Prophecy,\" hints at Icelandic versification, and the\nshort lines are hammer-strokes that warm the reader to enthusiasm. Far\nmore of the spirit of the old literature is in this short poem than is\nto be found in the whole of Longfellow's \"Saga of King Olaf.\" The\ncharacter of Biörn is well drawn, recalling Bodli, of Morris' poem, in\nits principal features. Certainly there is a reflection here of that Old\nNorse conception of life which gave to men's deeds their due reward, and\nwhich exalted the power of will. This poem was begun in 1850, but was\nnot published till 1868.\n\nIn Lowell's poems are to be found many figures and allusions pointing to\nhis familiarity with Icelandic song and story. At the end of the third\nstrophe of the \"Commemoration Ode,\" for instance, Truth is pictured as\nBrynhild,\n\n                plumed and mailed,\n    With sweet, stern face unveiled.\n\nIn these borrowings of themes and allusions, Lowell is at one with most\nof the poets of the present day. It used to be the fashion, and is\nstill, for tables of contents in volumes of verse to show titles like\nthese: \"Prometheus\"; \"Iliad VIII, 542-561\"; \"Alectryon.\" Present-day\nvolumes are becoming more and more besprinkled with titles like these:\n\"Balder the Beautiful\"; \"The Death of Arnkel,\" etc. In this fact alone\nis seen the turn of the tide. Heroes and heroines in dramas and novels\nare beginning to bear Old Norse names, even where the setting is not\nnorthern; witness Sidney Dobell's _Balder_, where not even a single\nallusion is made to Icelandic matters.\n\nMATTHEW ARNOLD (1822-1888).\n\nMatthew Arnold's strong sympathy with noble and virile literature of\nwhatever age or nation led him in time to Old Norse, and his poem\n\"Balder Dead\" is of distinct importance among the works of the\nnineteenth century in English literature. It is an addition of permanent\nvalue to our poetry, because of its marked originality and its high\nethical tone. \"Mallet, and his version of the Edda, is all the poem is\nbased upon,\" says Arnold.[20] It is the poet's divinely implanted\ninstinct that gathers from the few chapters of an old book a knowledge\nwonderfully full and deep of the cosmogony and eschatology of the\nnorthern nations of Europe. \"Balder Dead\" tells the familiar story of\nthe whitest of the gods, but it also contains the essence of Old\nIcelandic religion; indeed there is no single short work in our language\nwhich gives a tithe of the information about the North, its spirit, and\nits philosophy, which this poem of Matthew Arnold's sets forth. In\nfuture days a text-book of original English poems will be in the hands\nof our boys and girls which will enable them to get, through the medium\nof their own language, the message and the spirit of foreign literature.\nOld Norse song will need no other representative than Matthew Arnold's\n\"Balder Dead.\"\n\nThis is an original poem. It does not imitate the verse nor the word of\nthe older song, but the flavor of it is here. Gray and his imitators\ndrew from the Icelandic fountain \"dreadful songs\" and many poets since\nhave heard no milder note. Matthew Arnold's instincts were for peace and\nthe arts of peace, and he found in Balder a type for the ennobling of\nour own century. Balder says to his brother who has come to lament that\nLok's machinations will keep the best beloved of the gods in Niflheim:\n\n    For I am long since weary of your storm\n    Of carnage, and find, Hermod, in your life\n    Something too much of war and broils, which make\n    Life one perpetual fight, a bath of blood.\n    Mine eyes are dizzy with the arrowy hail;\n    Mine ears are stunn'd with blows, and sick for calm.\n\nArnold has exalted the Revelator of the Northern mythology, and in\nmagnificent poetry sets forth his apocalyptic vision:\n\n    Unarm'd, inglorious; I attend the course\n    Of ages, and my late return to light,\n    In times less alien to a spirit mild,\n    In new-recover'd seats, the happier day.\n\n      .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\n\n    Far to the south, beyond the blue, there spreads\n    Another Heaven, the boundless--no one yet\n    Hath reach'd it; there hereafter shall arise\n    The second Asgard, with another name.\n\n      .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\n\n    There re-assembling we shall see emerge\n    From the bright Ocean at our feet an earth\n    More fresh, more verdant than the last, with fruits\n    Self-springing, and a seed of man preserved,\n    Who then shall live in peace, as now in war.\n\nHere is the grandest message that the Old Norse religion had to give,\nand Matthew Arnold concerned himself with that alone. It is a far cry\nfrom Regner Lodbrog to this. There is a fine touch in the introduction\nof Regner into the lamentation of Balder. Arnold makes the old warrior\nsay of the ruder skalds:\n\n    But they harp ever on one string, and wake\n    Remembrance in our souls of war alone,\n    Such as on earth we valiantly have waged,\n    And blood, and ringing blows, and violent death.\n    But when thou sangest, Balder, thou didst strike\n    Another note, and, like a bird in spring,\n    Thy voice of joyance minded us, and youth,\n    And wife, and children, and our ancient home.\n\nHere is a human Norseman, a figure not often presented in the versions\nof the old stories that English poets and romancers have given us.\nArnold did a good service to Icelandic literature when he put into\nRegner's mouth mild sentiments and a love for home and family. The note\nis not lacking in the ancient literature, but it took Englishmen three\ncenturies to find it. It was the scholar, Matthew Arnold, who first\nrepeated the gentler strain in the rude music of the North, as it was\nthe scholar, Thomas Gray, who first echoed the \"dreadful songs\" of that\nold psalmody. Gray has all the culture of his age, when it was still\npossible to compass all knowledge in one lifetime; Arnold had all the\nliterary culture of his fuller century when multiplied sciences force a\nscholar to be content with one segment of human knowledge. The former\nhad music and architecture and other sciences among his accomplishments;\nthe latter spread out in literature, as \"Sohrab and Rustum,\" \"Empedocles\non Etna,\" \"Tristram and Iseult,\" as well as \"Balder Dead\" attest. The\nquatrain prefixed to the volume containing the narrative and elegiac\npoems be-tokens what joy Arnold had in his literary work, and indicates\nwhy these poems cannot fail to live:\n\n    What poets feel not, when they make,\n      A pleasure in creating,\n    The world in its turn will not take\n      Pleasure in contemplating.\n\nBalder is the creation of Old Norse poetry that is most popular with\ncontemporary English writers, and Matthew Arnold first made him so. As\nBugge points out, no deed of his is \"celebrated in song or story. His\npersonality only is described; of his activity in life almost no\nexternal trait is recorded. All the stress is laid upon his death; and,\nlike Christ, Baldr dies in his youth.\"[21]\n\n\nSIR GEORGE WEBBE DASENT (1820-1896).\n\nAmong the scholars who have labored to give England the benefit of a\nfuller and truer knowledge of Norse matters, none will be remembered\nmore gratefully than Sir George Webbe Dasent. Known to the reading\npublic most widely by his translations of the folk-tales of Asbjörnsen\nand Moe, he has still a claim upon the attention of the students of\nIcelandic. As we have seen, he gave out a translation of the _Younger\nEdda_ in 1842, and during the half century and more that followed he\nwrote other works of history and literature connected with our subject.\nTwo saga translations were published in 1861 and 1866, _The Story of\nBurnt Njal_, and _The Story of Gisli the Outlaw_, which will always rank\nhigh in this class of literature. _Njala_ especially is an excellent\npiece of work, a classic among translations. The \"Prolegomena\" is rich\nin information, and very little of it has been superseded by later\nscholarship. In 1887 and 1894 he translated for the Master of the Rolls,\n_The Orkney Saga_ and _The Saga of Hakon_, the texts of which Vigfusson\nhad printed in the same series some years before. The interest of the\ngovernment in Icelandic annals connected with English history is\nindicated in these last publications, and England is fortunate to have\nhad such enthusiastic scholars as Vigfusson and Dasent to do the work.\nThese men had been collaborators on the Cleasby Dictionary, and in this\nwork as in all others Dasent displayed an eagerness to have his\ncountrymen know how significant England's relationship to Iceland was.\nHe was as certain as Laing had been before him of the preeminence of\nthis literature among the mediæval writings. Like Laing, too, he would\nhave the general reader turn to this body of work \"which for its beauty\nand richness is worthy of being known to the greatest possible number of\nreaders.\"[22]\n\nTo mark the progress away from the old conception of unmitigated\nbrutality these words of Dasent stand here:[23] \"The faults of these\nNorsemen were the faults of their time; their virtues they possessed in\nlarger measure than the rest of their age, and thus when Christianity\nhad tamed their fury, they became the torch-bearers of civilization; and\nthough the plowshare of Destiny, when it planted them in Europe,\nuprooted along its furrow many a pretty flower of feeling in the lands\nwhich felt the fury of these Northern conquerers, their energy and\nendurance gave a lasting temper to the West, and more especially to\nEngland, which will wear so long as the world wears, and at the same\ntime implanted principles of freedom which shall never be rooted out.\nSuch results are a compensation for many bygone sorrows.\"\n\n\nCHARLES KINGSLEY (1819-1875).\n\nIn 1874, Charles Kingsley visited America and delivered some lectures.\nAmong these was one entitled \"The First Discovery of America.\" This\ninterests us here because it displays an appreciation, if not a deep\nknowledge, of Icelandic literature. In it the lecturer commended to\nLongfellow's attention a ballad sung in the Faroes, begging him to\ntranslate it some day, \"as none but he can translate it.\" \"It is so sad,\nthat no tenderness less exquisite than his can prevent its being\npainful; and at least in its _denouement_, so naive, that no purity less\nexquisite than his can prevent its being dreadful.\"[24] Later in the\nlecture he commends to his hearers the _Heimskringla_ of Snorri\nSturluson, the \"Homer of the North.\"[25]\n\nSpeaking of the elements that mingled to produce the British character,\nKingsley says: \"In manners as well as in religion, the Norse were\nhumanized and civilized by their contact with the Celts, both in\nScotland and in Ireland. Both peoples had valor, intellect, imagination:\nbut the Celt had that which the burly, angular Norse character, however\ndeep and stately, and however humorous, wanted; namely, music of nature,\ntenderness, grace, rapidity, playfulness; just the qualities, combining\nwith the Scandinavian (and in Scotland with the Angle) elements of\ncharacter which have produced, in Ireland and in Scotland, two schools\nof lyric poetry second to none in the world.\"[26] Over the page,\nKingsley has this to say: \"For they were a sad people, those old Norse\nforefathers of ours.\"[27] Humorous and sad are not inconsistent words in\nthese sentences; the Norseman had a sense of the ludicrous, and could\njest grimly in the face of death. Of the sadness of his life, no one\nneeds to be told who has read a saga or two. Kingsley says: \"There is,\nin the old sagas, none of that enjoyment of life which shines out\neverywhere in Greek poetry, even through its deepest tragedies. Not in\ncomplacency with Nature's beauty, but in the fierce struggle with her\nwrath, does the Norseman feel pleasure.\"[28]\n\nThis lecture shows a deeper acquaintance with Old Norse literature than\nKingsley was willing to acknowledge. Not only are the stories well\nchosen which he uses throughout, but the intuitions are sound, and the\ninferences based upon them. He anticipated the work of this\ninvestigation in the last words of the address. He has been telling the\nfine story of Thormod at Sticklestead:\n\n\"I shall not insult your intelligence by any comment or even epithet of\nmy own. I shall but ask you, Was not this man your kinsman? Does not the\nstory sound, allowing for all change of manners as well as of time and\nplace, like a scene out of your own Bret Harte or Colonel John Hay's\nwritings; a scene of the dry humor, the rough heroism of your own far\nWest? Yes, as long as you have your _Jem Bludsos_ and _Tom Flynns of\nVirginia City_, the old Norse blood is surely not extinct, the old Norse\nspirit is not dead.\"[29]\n\n\nEDMUND GOSSE (1849-).\n\nAmong contemporary English poets who have taught the world of readers\nthat things Norse are worthy of attention, is Edmund Gosse. He has been\nmore intimately connected with the popularization of modern Norwegian\nliterature, notably of Ibsen, but he has also found in Old Norse story\nthemes for poetic treatment. We mention \"The Death of Arnkel,\" found in\nthe volume _Firdausi in Exile_, more because it shows that our poets are\nturning to _the gesta islandicorum_ for themes, than because it is a\nremarkable poem. More pretentious is _King Erik, a Tragedy_, London,\n1876. Here is a noble drama which displays an intimate acquaintance with\nthe literature that gave it its themes and inspiration. The author\ndedicates it to Robert Browning, calling it:\n\n         ... this lyric symbol of my labour,\n      This antique light that led my dreams so long,\n    This battered hull of a barbaric tabor,\n         Beaten to runic song.\n\nI have often thought that fate was very unkind to keep Browning so\npersistently in the south of Europe, when, in Iceland and Norway, were\nmines that he could have worked in to such supreme advantage. To be sure\nhis method clashes with the simplicity of the Old Norse manner, but from\nhim we should have had men and women superb in stature and virility, and\nperhaps the Arctic influence would have killed the troublesome\ntropicality of his language.\n\nThis drama by Gosse is not strictly Icelandic in motive. Jealousy was\nnot the passion to loosen the tongue of the sagaman, and in so far as\nthat is the theme of \"King Erik,\" the play is not Old Norse in origin.\nChristian material, too, has been introduced that gives a modern tinge\nto the drama, but there is enough of the genuine saga spirit to warrant\nattention to it here. Something more than the names is Icelandic. Here\nis a woman, Botilda, with strength of character enough to recall a\nBrynhild or a Bergthora. Gisli is the foster-brother that takes up the\nblood-feud for Grimur. Adalbjörg and Svanhilda are the whisperers of\nslander and the workers of ill. Marcus is the skald who is making a poem\nabout the king. Here are customs and beliefs distinctly Norse:\n\n               I loved him from the first,\n      And so the second midnight to the cliff\n    We went. I mind me how the round moon rose,\n    And how a great whale in the offing plunged,\n    Dark on the golden circle. There we cut\n    A space of turf, and lifted it, and ran\n    Our knife-points sharp into our arms, and drew\n    Blood that dripped into the warm mould and mixed.\n    So there under the turf our plighted faith\n    Starts in the dew of grasses.\n\n(Act. IV, Sc. II.)\n\n    But all day long I hear amid the crowds,\n\n      .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\n\n    A voice that murmurs in a monotone,\n    Strange, warning words that scarcely miss the ear,\n    Yet miss it altogether.\n\n               _Botilda_.\n\n                         Oh! God grant,\n    You be not fey, nor truly near your end!\n\n(Act. IV, Sc. III.)\n\n\nAlthough this work is dramatic in form, it is not so in spirit. The true\ndramatist would have put such an incident as the swearing of brotherhood\ninto a scene, instead of into a speech. This effort is, however, the\nnearest approach to a drama in English founded on saga material. It is\ncurious that our poets have inclined to every form but the drama in\nreproducing Old Norse literature. It is not that saga-stuff is not\ndramatic in possibilities. Ewald and Oehlenschläger have used this\nmaterial to excellent effect in Danish dramas. Had the sagas been\naccessible to Englishmen in Shakespeare's time, we should certainly have\nhad dramas of Icelandic life.\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\nBY THE HAND OF THE MASTER.\n\n\nTime has brought us to the man whose work in this field needs no\napology. The writer whom we consider next contributed almost as much\nmaterial to the English treasury of Northern gold as did all the writers\nwe have so far considered. Were it not for William Morris, the\nexamination that we are making would not not be worth while. The name\n_literature_, in its narrow sense, belongs to only a few of the writings\nthat we have examined up to this point, but what we are now to inspect\ndeserves that title without the shadow of a doubt. For that reason we\nset in a separate chapter the examination of Morris' Old Norse\nadaptations and creations.\n\n\nWILLIAM MORRIS (1834-1896).\n\nThe biographer of William Morris fixes 1868 as the beginning of the\npoet's Icelandic stories.[30] Eirikr Magnusson, an Icelander, was his\nguide, and the pupil made rapid progress. Dasent's work had drawn\nMorris' attention to the sagas, and within a few months most of the\nsagas had been read in the original. Although _The Saga of Gunnlang\nWorm-tongue_ was published in the _Fortnightly Review_, for January,\n1869, the _Grettis Saga_, of April, was the first published book on an\nOld Norse subject. The next year gave the _Völsunga Saga_. In 1871,\nMorris made a journey through Iceland, the fruits of which were\nafterwards seen in many a noble work. In 1875, _Three Northern Love\nStories_ was published, and, in 1877, _The Story of Sigurd the Volsung\nand the Fall of the Niblungs_. More than ten years passed before he\nturned again to Icelandic work, the Romances of the years of 1889 to\n1896 showing signs of it, and the translations in the _Saga Library_,\n\"Howard the Halt,\" \"The Banded Men,\" _Eyrbyggja_ and _Heimskringla_ of\n1891-95. These contributions to the subject of our examination are no\nless valuable than voluminous, and we make no excuses for an extended\nconsideration of them. They deserve a wider public than they have yet\nattained.\n\n\n1.\n\n_The Story of Grettir the Strong_ is the title of Morris and Magnusson's\nversion of the _Grettis Saga_. The version impresses the reader as one\nmade with loving care by artistic hands. Certainly English readers will\nread no other translation of this work, for this one is satisfactory as\na version and as an art-work. English readers will here get all the\nflavor of the original that it is possible to get in a translation, and\nthose who can read Icelandic if put to it, will prefer to get _Grettla_\nthrough Morris and Magnusson. All the essentials are here, if not all\nthe nuances.\n\nThe reader unfamiliar with sagas will need a little patience with the\ngenealogies that crop out in every chapter. The sagaman has a\nsquirrel-like agility in climbing family trees, and he is well\nacquainted with their interlocking branches. There are chapters in the\n_Grettis Saga_ where this vanity runs riot, and makes us suspect that\nIceland differed little from a country town of to-day in its love for\ngossip about the family of neighbors whose names happen to come into the\nconversation. If the reader will persevere through the early chapters,\nuntil Grettir commands exclusive attention, he will come to a drama\nwhich has not many peers in literature. The outlaw kills a man in every\nother chapter, but this record is no vulgar list of brutal fights. Not\ninhuman nature, but human nature is here shown, human nature struggling\nwith unrelenting fate, making a grand fight, and coming to its end\nbecause it must, but without ignominy. How fine a touch it is that\nrefuses to the outlaw's murderer the price set upon Grettir's head,\nbecause the getting of it was through a \"nithings-deed,\" the murder of a\ndying man! William Morris was most felicitous in envoys and dedicating\npoems, and in the sonnet prefixed to this translation he was\nparticularly happy. The first eight lines describe the hero of the\nsaga--the last six lines the significance of this literary creation:\n\n    A life scarce worth the living, a poor fame\n    Scarce worth the winning, in a wretched land,\n    Where fear and pain go upon either hand,\n    As toward the end men fare without an aim\n    Unto the dull grey dark from whence they came:\n    Let them alone, the unshadowed sheer rocks stand\n    Over the twilight graves of that poor band,\n    Who count so little in the great world's game!\n\n    Nay, with the dead I deal not; this man lives,\n    And that which carried him through good and ill,\n    Stern against fate while his voice echoed still\n    From rock to rock, now he lies silent, strives\n    With wasting time, and through its long lapse gives\n    Another friend to me, life's void to fill.\n\n\n2.\n\nIn the three volumes of _The Earthly Paradise_, published by William\nMorris in 1868-1870, there are three poems which hail from Old Norse\noriginals. They are \"The Land East of the Sun and West of the Moon,\" and\n\"The Lovers of Gudrun,\" in Vol. II, and \"The Fostering of Aslaug,\" in\nVol. III. Of these \"The Lovers of Gudrun\" forms a class by itself; it is\na poem to be reckoned with when the dozen greatest poems of the century\nare listed. The late Laureate may have equalled it in the best of the\n_Idylls of the King_, but he never excelled it. Let us look at it in\ndetail.\n\nFirst, be it said that \"The Lovers of Gudrun\" overtops all the other\npoems in _The Earthly Paradise_. It would be possible to prove that\nMorris was at his best when he worked with Old Norse material, but that\ntask shall not detain us now. It is enough to note that the \"Prologue\"\nto _The Earthly Paradise_, called \"The Wanderers,\" makes the leader of\nthese wanderers, who turn story-tellers when they reach the city by \"the\nborders of the Grecian sea,\" a Norseman. Born in Byzantium of a Greek\nmother, he claimed Norway as his home, and on his father's death\nreturned to his kin. His speech to the Elder of the City reveals a\ntouching loyalty to his father's home and traditions:\n\n    But when I reached one dying autumn-tide\n    My uncle's dwelling near the forest-side,\n    And saw the land so scanty and so bare,\n    And all the hard things men contend with there,\n    A little and unworthy land it seemed,\n    And yet the more of Asagard I dreamed,\n    And worthier seemed the ancient faith of praise.\n\nHere is the man, William Morris, in perfect miniature. Modern life and\ntraining had given him a speech and aspect quite suave and cultured, but\nthe blood that flowed in his veins was red, and the tincture of iron was\nin it. In religion, in art, in poetry, in economics, he loved the past\nbetter than the present, though he was never unconscious of \"our\nglorious gains.\" In all departments of thought the scanty, the bare, the\nhard, the unworthy, drew first his attention and then his love and\nenthusiastic praise. And so perhaps it is explained that of all the\npoems in _The Earthly Paradise_, the one indited first in the scarred\nand dreadful land where neither wheat nor wine is at home, shall be the\nfinest in this latter-day retelling.\n\nThe first seventy years of the thirteenth century were the blossoming\ntime of the historic saga in Iceland, and those writings that record the\ndoings of the families of the land form, with the old songs and the best\nof the kingly sagas, the flower of Northern literature. These family\nrecords never extend over more than one generation, and sometimes they\ndeal with but a few years. They are half-way between romance and\nhistory, with the balance oftenest in favor of truth. In this group are\nfound _Egils Saga_, known at second hand to Warton, the _Eyrbyggja\nSaga_, translated by Walter Scott, and the _Laxdæla Saga_. It is the\n_Laxdæla Saga_ that gives the story told by Morris in \"The Lovers of\nGudrun.\" Among sagas it is famous for its fine portrayal of character.\n\nThe saga and the poem tell the story of two neighboring farms, Herdholt\nand Bathsted, whose sons and daughters work out a dire tragedy. Kiartan\nand Bodli are the son and foster-son of the first house, and Gudrun is\nthe daughter of the second. These are the principal personages in the\ndrama, though the list of the other _dramatis personæ_ is a long one.\nNot only in the name of its heroine does the story suggest the\n_Nibelungenlied_. The machinery of the Norse stories resembles the\nGerman story's in many of its parts. In this version of Morris, the main\nfeatures of the saga are kept, and distracting details are properly\nsubordinated to the principal interest. Through the nineteen divisions\nof this story the interest moves rapidly, and wonder as to the issue is\nnever lost. As a story-teller, Morris is distinctly powerful in this\npoem, and all the qualities that endear the story-teller to us are here\nfound joined to many that make the poet a favorite with us. There are no\nlyrics in the poem--the original saga was without the song-snatches that\nare often found in sagas--but there are dramatic scenes that recall the\npower of the Master-poet. Least of all the poems in the _Earthly\nParadise_ does \"The Lovers of Gudrun\" show the Chaucerian influence, and\nthe reader must be captious indeed who complains of the length of this\nstory.\n\nTo the unenlightened reader this poem reveals no traits that are\nun-English. What there is of Old Norse flavor here is purely spiritual.\nThe original story being in prose, no attempt could be made to keep\noriginal characteristics in verse-form. So \"The Lovers of Gudrun\" can\nstand on its own merits as an English poem; no excuses need be made for\nit on the plea that it is a translation.\n\nLocal color is not laid on the canvas after the figures have been\npainted, but all the tints in the persons and the things are grandly\nNorse. This story is a true romance, in that the scene is far removed\nfrom the present day, and the atmosphere is very different from our own.\nThis story is a true picture of life, in that it sets forth the doings\nof men and women in the power of the master passion. And so for the\npurposes of literature this poem is not Norse, or rather, it is more\nthan Norse, it is universal. Now and then, to be sure, the displaced\nNorse ideals are set forth in the poem, but in such wise that we almost\nregret that the old order has passed away. The Wanderer who tells the\ntale assures his listeners of the truth of it in these last words of the\ninterlude between \"The Story of Rhodope\" and \"The Lovers of Gudrun\":\n\n                 Know withal that we\n    Have ever deemed this tale as true to be,\n    As though those very Dwellers in Laxdale,\n    Risen from the dead had told us their own tale;\n    Who for the rest while yet they dwelt on earth\n    Wearied no God with prayers for more of mirth\n    Than dying men have; nor were ill-content\n    Because no God beside their sorrow went\n    Turning to flowery sward the rock-strewn way,\n    Weakness to strength, or darkness into day.\n    Therefore, no marvels hath my tale to tell,\n    But deals with such things as men know too well;\n    All that I have herein your hearts to move,\n    Is but the seed and fruit of bitter love.\n\nIt is aside from our purpose to tell this story here. The more we study\nthis marvelous work, the more it is impressed upon us that in the reign\nof love all men and all literatures are one. To the Englishman this\ndescription of an Iceland maiden is no stranger than it was to the men\nwho sat about the spluttering fire in the Icelander's hall. It is the\nform of Gudrun that is here described:\n\n    That spring was she just come to her full height,\n    Low-bosomed yet she was, and slim and light,\n    Yet scarce might she grow fairer from that day;\n    Gold were the locks wherewith the wind did play,\n    Finer than silk, waved softly like the sea\n    After a three days' calm, and to her knee\n    Wellnigh they reached; fair were the white hands laid\n    Upon the door posts where the dragons played;\n    Her brow was smooth now, and a smile began\n    To cross her delicate mouth, the snare of man.\n\n(_Earthly Paradise_, Vol. II, p. 247.)\n\nNot less accustomed are we to such heroes as Kiartan:\n\n    And now in every mouth was Kiartan's name,\n    And daily now must Gudrun's dull ears bear\n    Tales of the prowess of his youth to hear,\n    While in his cairn forgotten lay her love.\n    For this man, said they, all men's hearts did move,\n    Nor yet might envy cling to such an one,\n    So far beyond all dwellers 'neath the sun;\n    Great was he, yet so fair of face and limb\n    That all folk wondered much, beholding him,\n    How such a man could be; no fear he knew,\n    And all in manly deeds he could outdo;\n    Fleet-foot, a swimmer strong, an archer good,\n    Keen-eyed to know the dark waves' changing mood;\n    Sure on the crag, and with the sword so skilled,\n    That when he played therewith the air seemed filled\n    With light of gleaming blades; therewith was he\n    Of noble speech, though says not certainly\n    My tale, that aught of his he left behind\n    With rhyme and measure deftly intertwined.\n\n(P. 266.)\n\nThe Old Norse touch here is in the last three lines which intimate that\nthe warrior was often a bard; but be it remembered that the Elizabethan\nwarrior could turn a sonnet, too.\n\nWe have said that the _Laxdæla Saga_ is famous for its portrayal of\ncharacter. This English version falls not at all below the original in\nthis quality. The lines already quoted show Gudrun and Kiartan as to\nexterior. But this is a drama of flesh and blood creations, and they are\nmen and women that move through it, not puppets. Souls are laid bare\nhere, in quivering, pulsating agony. The tremendous figure of this story\nis not Kiartan, nor Gudrun, nor Refna, but Bodli, and certainly English\nnarrative poetry has no second creation like to him. The mind reverts to\nShakespeare to find fit companionship for Bodli in poetry, and to George\nEliot and Thomas Hardy in prose. The suggestion of Shakespearean\nqualities in George Eliot has been made by several great critics, among\nthem Edmond Scherer;[31] in Hardy and Morris, here, we find the same\nsoul-searching powers. These writers have created sufferers of titanic\ngreatness, and in the presence of their tragedies we are dumb.\n\nAn English artist has made Napoleon's voyage on H.M.S. _Bellerophon_ to\nhis prison-isle a picture that the memory refuses to forget. The picture\nof Bodli as he sails back to Iceland, which, though his home, is to be\nhis prison and his death, is no less impressive:\n\n    Fair goes the ship that beareth out Christ's truth\n    Mingled of hope, of sorrow, and of ruth,\n    And on the prow Bodli the Christian stands,\n    Sunk deep in thought of all the many lands\n    The world holds, and the folk that dwell therein,\n    And wondering why that grief and rage and sin\n    Was ever wrought; but wondering most of all\n    Why such wild passion on his heart should fall.\n\n(P. 294.)\n\nHere we have the poet's conception--and the sagaman's--of Bodli--a man\nin the grip of terrible Fate, who can no more swerve from the paths she\nmarks out for him than he can add a cubit to his stature. The Greek\ntragedy embodies this idea, and Old Norse literature is full of it.\nThomas Hardy gives it later in his contemporary novels. We sympathize\nwith Bodli's fate because his agony is so terrible, and we call him the\nmost striking figure in this story. But the others suffer, too, Gudrun,\nKiartan, Refna; they make a stand against their woe, and utter brave\nwords in the face of it. Only Bodli floats downward with the tide,\nunresisting. Guest prophesies bitter things for Gudrun, but adds:\n\n    Be merry yet! these things shall not be all\n    That unto thee in this thy life shall fall.\n\n(P. 254.)\n\nAnd Gudrun takes heart. When Thurid tells her brother Kiartan that\nGudrun has married another, his joy is shivered into atoms before him.\nBut he can say, even then:\n\n    Now is this world clean changed for me\n    In this last minute, yet indeed I see\n    That still it will go on for all my pain;\n    Come then, my sister, let us back again;\n    I must meet folk, and face the life beyond,\n    And, as I may, walk 'neath the dreadful bond\n    Of ugly pain--such men our fathers were,\n    Not lightly bowed by any weight of care.\n\n(P. 311.)\n\nAnd Kiartan does his work in the world. Poor Refna, when she has married\nKiartan hears women talking of the love that still is between Gudrun and\nKiartan. She goes to Kiartan with the story, beginning with words whose\npathos must conquer the most stoical of readers:\n\n          Indeed of all thy grief I knew,\n    But deemed if still thou saw'st me kind and true,\n    Not asking too much, yet not failing aught\n    To show that not far off need love be sought,\n    If thou shouldst need love--if thou sawest all this,\n    Thou wouldst not grudge to show me what a bliss\n    Thy whole love was, by giving unto me\n    As unto one who loved thee silently,\n    Now and again the broken crumbs thereof:\n    Alas! I, having then no part in love,\n    Knew not how naught, naught can allay the soul\n    Of that sad thirst, but love untouched and whole!\n    Kinder than e'er I durst have hoped thou art,\n    Forgive me then, that yet my craving heart\n    Is so unsatisfied; I know that thou\n    Art fain to dream that I am happy now,\n    And for that seeming ever do I strive;\n    Thy half-love, dearest, keeps me still alive\n    To love thee; and I bless it--but at whiles,--\n\n(P. 343)\n\nAnd thus she gains strength to live her life.\n\nHere, then, in Bodli, is another of the great tragic figures in\nliterature--a sick man. There are many of them, even in the highest rank\nof literary creations, Hamlet, Lear, Othello, Macbeth! Wrong-headed,\ndefective as they are, we would not have them otherwise. The pearl of\ngreatest price is the result of an abnormal or morbid process.\n\nBodli comes to us from Icelandic literature, and in that fact we note\nthe solidarity of poetic geniuses. Not only is the great figure of Bodli\nproof of this solidarity, but many other features of this poem prove it.\n\"Lively feeling for a situation and power to express it constitute the\npoet,\" said Goethe. There are dramatic situations in \"The Lovers of\nGudrun\" which hold the reader in a breathless state till the last word\nis said, and then leave him marveling at the imagination that could\nconceive the scene, and the power that could express it. There are\ngentler scenes, too, in the poem, where beauty and grace are conceived\nas fair as ever poet dreamed, and the workmanship is thoroughly\nadequate. As an example of the first, take the scene of Bodli's mourning\nover Kiartan's dead body. It is here that we get that knowledge of\nBodli's woe that robs us of a cause against him. What agony is that\nwhich can speak thus over the body of the dead rival!\n\n                         ... Didst thou quite\n    Know all the value of that dear delight\n    As I did? Kiartan, she is changed to thee;\n    Yea, and since hope is dead changed too to me,\n    What shall we do, if, each of each forgiven,\n    We three shall meet at last in that fair heaven\n    The new faith tells of? Thee and God I pray\n    Impute it not for sin to me to-day,\n    If no thought I can shape thereof but this:\n    O friend, O friend, when thee I meet in bliss,\n    Wilt thou not give my love Gudrun to me,\n    Since now indeed thine eyes made clear can see\n    That I of all the world must love her most?\n\n(P. 368.)\n\nExamples of the gentler scenes are scattered lavishly throughout the\npoem and it is not necessary to enumerate.\n\nOne other sign that the Icelandic sagaman's art was kin to the English\npoet's. The last line of this poem is given thus by Morris:\n\n    I did the worst to him I loved the most.\n\nThese are the very words of Gudrun in the saga, and summing up as they\ndo her opinion of Kiartan, they stand as a model of that compression\nwhich is so admired in our poetry. Many such _multum in parvo_ lines are\nfound in Morris' poem, and at times they have a beauty that is\nmarvelous. Joined with this quality is the special merit of\nMorris--picturesqueness, and so the reader often feels, when he has\nfinished a book by Morris, like the Cook tourist after he has \"done\" a\ncountry of Europe--it must be done again and again to give it its due.\n\nOf the other two Old Norse poems in _The Earthly Paradise_ not much need\nbe said. \"The Land East of the Sun and West of the Moon\" is a fairy\ntale, in the strain of Morris' prose romances. It was suggested by\nThorpe's _Yule-tide Stories_, the tale coming from the _Völundar Saga_.\nThere is a witchery about it that makes it pleasant reading in a dreamy\nhour, but except the names and a few scenes about the farmstead, there\nis nothing Icelandic about it. The virile element of the best Icelandic\nliterature is wanting here, and the hero's excuse for leaving weapons at\nhome when he goes to his watch is not at all natural:\n\n              Withal I shall not see\n    Men-folk belike, but faërie,\n    And all the arms within the seas\n    Should help me naught to deal with these;\n    Rather of such love were I fain\n    As fell to Sigurd Fafnir's-bane\n    When of the dragon's heart he ate.\n\n(Vol. II, p. 33.)\n\nThis passage is nominally in the same meter as the opening lines of the\npoem:\n\n    In this your land there once did dwell\n    A certain carle who lived full well,\n    And lacked few things to make him glad;\n    And three fair sons this goodman had.\n\nAccording to old time English prosody, it is the same, too, as the meter\nof Scott's Marmion!\n\nIn the passages quoted from \"The Lovers of Gudrun\" we see a measure\ncalled the same as that of Pope's _Essay on Man_! Not seldom in \"The\nLovers\" do we forget that the lines are rhymed in twos; indeed, often we\ndo not note the rhyme at all. We are sometimes tempted to think that in\nthis piece, if not in \"The Land East of the Sun,\" rhyme might have been\ndispensed with altogether, since it often forces archaic words and\nexpressions into use. But it is to be said generally of Morris's\nmanagement of the meter in the Old Norse pieces, that it was adequate to\ngain his end always, whether that end was to tell an Old Norse story in\nEnglish, or to carry over an Old Norse spirit into English. Of this\nsecond achievement we shall speak further in considering _Sigurd the\nVolsung_.\n\nThere is one more tale in _The Earthly Paradise_ which originated in\nNorse legend. \"The Fostering of Aslaug\" is drawn from Thorpe's _Northern\nMythology_, which epitomizes older sources. Aslaug is the daughter of\nIceland's great hero, Sigurd, and Iceland's great heroine, Brynhild, and\nher life is set down in this poem most beautifully. Again we note that\nthe added touches of later poets fail to leave the sense of the\nstrenuous in the picture. Aslaug is like a favorite representation of\nBrynhild that we have seen, a lily-maid in aspect, or a Marguerite. Her\nmother's masculinity is gone, and with it the Old Norse flavor. It is\nthe privilege of our age to enjoy both the virility of the Old Norse and\nthe delicacy of the mediæval conceptions, and William Morris has caught\nboth.\n\n\n3.\n\nIn the opening lines of \"The Fostering of Aslaug,\" our poet wrote his\ndoubts about his ability to sing the life of Sigurd in be-fitting\nmanner. At that time he said:\n\n    But now have I no heart to raise\n    That mighty sorrow laid asleep,\n    That love so sweet, so strong and deep,\n    That as ye hear the wonder told\n    In those few strenuous words of old,\n    The whole world seems to rend apart\n    When heart is torn away from heart.\n\n(Vol. III, p. 28.)\n\nIt is a common complaint against the poetry of William Morris that it is\ntoo long-winded. Each to his taste in this matter, but we beg to call\nattention to one line in the above passage:\n\n    In those few strenuous words of old.\n\nWhatever may have been Morris' tendency when he wrote his own poetry, he\nknew when concision was a virtue in the poetry of others. There is no\nbetter description of the _Völsunga Saga_ than the above line, and\nWilliam Morris gave the English people a literal version of the saga, if\nmayhap that strenuous paucity might translate the old spirit. But, as if\nhe knew that many readers would fail to make much of this version, he\ntried again on a larger scale, and the great volume _Sigurd the\nVolsung_, epic in character and proportions, was the result. Of these\ntwo we shall now speak.\n\nThe _Völsunga Saga_ was published in 1870, only two years after Morris\nhad begun to study Icelandic with Eirikr Magnusson. The latter's name is\non the title page as the first of the two co-translators. The _Saga_ was\nsupplemented by certain songs from the _Elder Edda_ which were\nintroduced by the translators at points where they would come naturally\nin the story. The work, both in prose and verse, is well done, and the\nattempt was successful to make, as the preface proposes, the \"rendering\nclose and accurate, and, if it might be so, at the same time, not over\nprosaic.\" The last two paragraphs of this preface are particularly\ninteresting to one who is tracing the influence of Old Norse literature\non English literature, because they are words with power, that have\nstirred men and will stir men to learn more about a wonderful land and\nits lore. We copy them entire:\n\n\"As to the literary quality of this work we might say much, but we think\nwe may well trust the reader of poetic insight to break through whatever\nentanglement of strange manners or unused element may at first trouble\nhim, and to meet the nature and beauty with which it is filled: we\ncannot doubt that such a reader will be intensely touched by finding,\namidst all its wildness and remoteness, such startling realism, such\nsubtilty, such close sympathy with all the passions that may move\nhimself to-day.\n\n\"In conclusion, we must again say how strange it seems to us, that this\nVolsung Tale, which is in fact an unversified poem, should never before\nhave been translated into English. For this is the Great Story of the\nNorth, which should be to all our race what the Tale of Troy was to the\nGreeks--to all our race first, and afterwards, when the change of the\nworld has made our race nothing more than a name of what has been--a\nstory too--then should it be to those that come after us no less than\nthe Tale of Troy has been to us.\"\n\nMorris wrote a prologue in verse for this volume, and it is an exquisite\npoem, such as only he seemed able to indite. So often does the reader of\nMorris come upon gems like this, that one is tempted to rail against the\ncommon ignorance about him:\n\n    O hearken, ye who speak the English Tongue,\n      How in a waste land ages long ago,\n    The very heart of the North bloomed into song\n      After long brooding o'er this tale of woe!\n\n      .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\n\n    Yea, in the first gray dawning of our race,\n      This ruth-crowned tangle to sad hearts was dear.\n\n      .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\n\n    So draw ye round and hearken, English Folk,\n      Unto the best tale pity ever wrought!\n    Of how from dark to dark bright Sigurd broke,\n      Of Brynhild's glorious soul with love distraught,\n      Of Gudrun's weary wandering unto naught,\n    Of utter love defeated utterly,\n    Of Grief too strong to give Love time to die!\n\n\n4.\n\nSix years later, in 1877 (English edition), Morris published the long\npoem, _The Story of Sigurd the Volsung and The Fall of the Niblungs_,\nand in it gave the peerless crown of all English poems springing from\nOld Norse sources. The poet considered this his most important work, and\nhe was prouder of it than of any other literary work that he did. One\nwho studies it can understand this pride, but he cannot understand the\nneglect by the reading public of this remarkable poem. The history of\nbook-selling in the last decade shows strange revivals of interest in\nauthors long dead; it will be safe to prophesy such a revival for\nWilliam Morris, because valuable treasures will not always remain\nhidden. In his case, however, it will not be a revival, because there\nhas not been an awakening yet. That awakening must come, and thousands\nwill see that William Morris was a great poet who have not yet heard of\nhis name. Let us look at his greatest work with some degree of\nminuteness.\n\nThe opening lines are a good model of the meter, and we find it\ndifferent from any that we have considered so far. There are certain\npeculiarities about it that make it seem a perfect medium for\ntranslating the Old Norse spirit. Most of these peculiarities are in the\nopening lines, and so we may transfer them to this page:[32]\n\n    There was a dwelling of Kings ere the world was waxen old;\n    Dukes were the door-wards there, and the roofs were thatched with gold;\n    Earls were the wrights that wrought it, and silver nailed its doors;\n    Earls' wives were the weaving-women, queens' daughters strewed its\n            floors,\n    And the masters of its song-craft were the mightiest men that cast\n    The sails of the storm of battle adown the bickering blast.\n\nEverybody knows that alliteration was a principle of Icelandic verse. It\nstrikes the ear that hears Icelandic poetry for the first time--or the\neye that sees it, since most of us read it silently--as unpleasantly\ninsistent, but on fuller acquaintance, we lose this sense of\nobtrusiveness. Morris, in this poem, uses alliteration, but so skilfully\nthat only the reader that seeks it discovers it. A less superb artist\nwould have made it stick out in every line, so that the device would be\na hindrance to the story-telling. As it is, nowhere in the more than\nnine thousand lines of _Sigurd the Volsung_ is this alliteration an\nexcrescence, but everywhere it is woven into the grand design of a\nfabric which is the richer for its foreign workmanship.\n\nNotice that _duke_ and _battle_ and _master_ are the only words not\nthoroughly Teutonic. This overwhelming predominance of the Anglo-Saxon\nelement over the French is in keeping with the original of the story. Of\ncourse it is an accident that so small a proportion of Latin derivatives\nis found in these six lines, but the fact remains that Morris set\nhimself to tell a Teutonic story in Teutonic idiom. That idiom is not\nvery strange to present-day readers, indeed we may say it has but a\nfillip of strangeness. Archaisms are characteristic of poetic diction,\nand those found in this poem that are not common to other poetry are\nused to gain an Old Norse flavor. The following words taken from Book I\nof the poem are the only unfamiliar ones: _benight_, meaning \"at night\";\n\"so _win_ the long years over\"; _eel-grig_; _sackless_; _bursten_, a\nparticiple. The compounds _door-ward_ and _song-craft_ are\nrepresentative of others that are sprinkled in fair number through the\npoem. They are the best that our language can do to reproduce the fine\ncombinations that the Icelandic language formed so readily. English\nlends itself well to this device, as the many compounds show that Morris\ntook from common usage. Such words as _roof-tree_, _song-craft_,\n_empty-handed_, _grave-mound_, _store-house_, taken at random from the\npages of this poem, show that the genius of our language permits such\nformations. When Morris carries the practice a little further, and makes\nfor his poem such words as _door-ward_, _chance-hap_, _slumber-tide_,\n_troth-word_, _God-home_, and a thousand others, he is not taking\nliberties with the language, and he is using a powerful aid in\ntranslating the Old Norse spirit.\n\nOne more peculiar characteristic of Icelandic is admirably exhibited in\nthis poem. We have seen that Warton recognized in the \"Runic poets\" a\nwarmth of fancy which expressed itself in \"circumlocution and\ncomparisons, not as a matter of necessity, but of choice and skill.\"\nCertainly Morris in using these circumlocutions in _Sigurd the Volsung_,\nhas exercised remarkable skill in weaving them into his story. Like the\nalliterations, they are part of an harmonious design. Examples abound,\nlike:\n\n    Adown unto the swan-bath the Volsung Children ride;\n\nand this other for the same thing, the sea:\n\n    While sleepeth the fields of the fishes amidst the summer-tide.\n\nStill others for the water are _swan-mead_, and \"bed-gear of the swan.\"\n\n\"The serpent of death\" and _war-flame_, for sword; _earth-bone_, for\nrock; _fight-sheaves_, for armed hosts; _seaburg_, for boats, are other\nstriking examples.\n\nSo much for the mechanical details of this poem. Its literary features\nare so exceptional that we must examine them at length.\n\nBook I is entitled \"Sigmund\" and the description is set at the head of\nit. \"In this book is told of the earlier days of the Volsungs, and of\nSigmund the father of Sigurd, and of his deeds, and of how he died while\nSigurd was yet unborn in his mother's womb.\"\n\nThere are many departures from the _Völsunga Saga_ in this poetic\nversion, and all seem to be accounted for by a desire to impress\npresent-day readers with this story. The poem begins with Volsung,\nomitting, therefore, the marvelous birth of that king and the oath of\nthe unborn child to \"flee in fear from neither fire nor the sword.\" The\nsaga makes the wolf kill one of Volsung's sons every night; the poem\nchanges the number to two. A magnificent scene is invented by Morris in\nthe midnight visit of Signy to the wood where her brothers had been\nslain. She speaks to the brother that is left, desiring to know what he\nis doing:\n\n    O yea, I am living indeed, and this labor of mine hand\n    Is to bury the bones of the Volsungs; and lo, it is well nigh done.\n    So draw near, Volsung's daughter, and pile we many a stone\n    Where lie the gray wolf s gleanings of what was once so good.\n\n(P. 23.)\n\nThe dialogue of brother and sister is a mighty conception, and surely\nthe old Icelanders would have called Morris a rare singer. Sigmund tells\nthe story of the deaths of his brothers, adding:\n\n    But now was I wroth with the Gods, that had made the Volsungs for\n            nought;\n    And I said: in the Day of their Doom a man's help shall they miss.\n\n(P. 24.)\n\nBut Signy is reconciled to the workings of Fate:\n\n    I am nothing so wroth as thou art with the ways of death and hell,\n    For thereof had I a deeming when all things were seeming well.\n\nThe day to come shall set their woes right:\n\n    There as thou drawest thy sword, thou shall think of the days that were\n    And the foul shall still seem foul, and the fair shall still seem fair;\n    But thy wit shall then be awakened, and thou shalt know indeed\n    Why the brave man's spear is broken, and his war shield fails at need;\n    Why the loving is unbeloved; why the just man falls from his state;\n    Why the liar gains in a day what the soothfast strives for late.\n    Yea, and thy deeds shalt thou know, and great shall thy gladness be;\n    As a picture all of gold thy life-days shalt thou see,\n    And know that thou wert a God to abide through the hurry and haste;\n    A God in the golden hall, a God in the rain-swept waste,\n    A God in the battle triumphant, a God on the heap of the slain:\n    And thine hope shall arise and blossom, and thy love shall be quickened\n            again:\n    And then shalt thou see before thee the face of all earthly ill;\n    Thou shalt drink of the cup of awakening that thine hand hath holpen to\n            fill;\n    By the side of the sons of Odin shalt thou fashion a tale to be told\n    In the hall of the happy Baldur.\n\n(P. 25.)\n\nIn this wise one Christian might hearten another to accept the dealings\nof Providence to-day. While we do not think that a worshipper of Odin\nwould have spoken all these words, they are not an undue exaggeration of\nthe noblest traits of the old Icelandic religion.\n\nThe poem does not record the death of Siggeir's and Signy's son, though\nthe saga does. Morris adds a touch when he makes the imprisoned men\nexult over the sword that Signy drops into their grave, and he also puts\ninto the mouth of Siggeir in the burning hall words that the saga does\nnot contain. The poem says that the women of the Gothfolk were permitted\nto retire from the burning hall, but the saga has no such statement. The\nwar of foul words between Granmar and Sinfjötli is left in the saga, and\nthe cause of Gudrod's death is changed from rivalry over a woman to\nanger over a division of war booty. In Sigmund's lament over his\nchildlessness we have another of the poet's additions, and certainly we\nfind no fault with the liberty:\n\n    The tree was stalwart, but its boughs are old and worn.\n    Where now are the children departed, that amidst my life were born?\n    I know not the men about me, and they know not of my ways:\n    I am nought but a picture of battle, and a song for the people to\n            praise.\n    I must strive with the deeds of my kingship, and yet when mine hour is\n            come\n    It shall meet me as glad as the goodman when he bringeth the last load\n            home.\n\n(P. 56.)\n\nWhen the great hero dies, Morris puts into his mouth another of the\nmagnificent speeches that are the glory of this poem. Four lines from it\nmust suffice:\n\n    When the gods for one deed asked me I ever gave them twain;\n    Spendthrift of glory I was, and great was my life-day's gain.\n\n     .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\n\n    Our wisdom and valour have kissed, and thine eyes shall see the fruit,\n    And the joy for his days that shall be hath pierced my heart to the\n            root.\n\n(P. 62.)\n\nIt appears from this study of Book I that _Sigurd the Volsung_ has\nadapted the saga story to our civilization and our art, holding to the\nbest of the old and supplementing it by new that is ever in keeping with\nthe old. Other instances of this eclectic habit may be seen in the other\nthree books, but we shall quote from these for other purposes.\n\nBook II is entitled \"Regin.\" \"Now this is the first book of the life and\ndeath of Sigurd the Volsung, and therein is told of the birth of him,\nand of his dealings with Regin the Master of Masters, and of his deeds\nin the waste places of the earth.\"\n\nMorris was deeply read in Old Norse literature, and out of his stores of\nknowledge he brought vivifying details for this poem. Such, for\ninstance, is the description of Sigurd's eyes, not found just here in\nthe saga:\n\n    In the bed there lieth a man-child, and his eyes look straight on\n            the sun.\n\n     .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\n\n    Yet they shrank in their rejoicing before the eyes of the child.\n\n     .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\n\nIn the naming of the child by an ancient name, the meaning of that name\nis indicated:\n\n    O _Sigurd_, Son of the Volsungs, O Victory yet to be!\n\nThe festivities over the birth of the child are wonderfully described\nin the brief lines, and they are a picture out of another book than the\nsaga:\n\n    Earls think of marvellous stories, and along the golden strings\n    Flit words of banded brethren and names of war-fain Kings.\n\nOver and over again in this poem Morris records the Icelanders' desire\n\"to leave a tale to tell,\" and here are Sigurd's words to Regin who has\nbeen egging him on to deeds:\n\n    Yet I know that the world is wide, and filled with deeds unwrought;\n    And for e'en such work was I fashioned, lest the songcraft come to\n            nought,\n    When the harps of God-home tinkle, and the Gods are at stretch to\n            hearken:\n    Lest the hosts of the Gods be scanty when their day hath begun to\n            darken.\n\n(P. 82.)\n\nIn Book II we have other great speeches that the poet has put into the\nmouth of his characters with little or no justification in the original\nsaga. Chap. XIV of the saga contains Regin's tale of his brothers, and\nof the gold called \"Andvari's Hoard,\" and that tale is severely brief\nand plain. The account in the poem is expanded greatly, and the\nconception of Regin materially altered. In the saga he was not the\ndiscontented youngest son of his father, prone to talk of his woes and\nto lament his lot. In the poem he does this in so eloquent a fashion\nthat almost we are persuaded to sympathize with him. Certainly his lines\nwere hard, to have outlived his great deeds, and to hear his many\ninventions ascribed to the gods. The speech of the released Odin to\nReidmar is modeled on Job's conception of omnipotence, and it is one of\nthe memorable parts of this book. Gripir's prophecy, too, is a majestic\nwork, and its original was three sentences in the saga and the poem\n_Grípisspá_ in the heroic songs of the _Edda_. Here Morris rises to the\nheights of Sigurd's greatness:\n\n                  Sigurd, Sigurd! O great, O early born!\n    O hope of the Kings first fashioned! O blossom of the morn!\n    Short day and long remembrance, fair summer of the North!\n    One day shall the worn world wonder how first thou wentest forth!\n\n(P. 111.)\n\nThose who have read William Morris know that he is a master of nature\ndescription. The \"Glittering Heath\" offered a fine opportunity for this\nsort of work, and in this piece we have another departure from the saga,\nMorris made hundreds of pictures in this poem, but the pages describing\nthe journey to the \"Glittering Heath\" are packed with them to an\nextraordinary degree. Here is Iceland in very fact, all dust and ashes\nto the eye:\n\n    More changeless than mid-ocean, as fruitless as its floor.\n\nWe confess that there is something in the scene that holds us, all shorn\nof beauty though it is. We do not want to go the length of Thomas Hardy,\nhowever, who, in that wonderful first chapter of _The Return of the\nNative_ has a similar heath to describe. \"The new vale of Tempe,\" says\nhe, \"may be a gaunt waste in Thule: human souls may find themselves in\ncloser and closer harmony with external things wearing a sombreness\ndistasteful to our race when it was young.... The time seems near, if it\nhas not actually arrived, when the mournful sublimity of a moor, a sea,\nor a mountain, will be all of nature that is absolutely consonant with\nthe moods of the more thinking among mankind. And ultimately, to the\ncommonest tourist, spots like Iceland may become what the vineyards and\nmyrtlegardens of South Europe are to him now.\" Is it not a suggestive\nthought that England and the nineteenth century evolved a pessimism\nwhich poor Iceland on its ash-heap never could conceive? William Morris\nwas an Icelander, not an Englishman, in his philosophy.\n\nIn this same scene, a notable deviation from the saga is the\nconversation between Regin and Sigurd concerning the relations that\nshall be between them after the slaying of Fafnir. Here Morris impresses\nthe lesson of Regin's greed, taking the un-Icelandic device of preaching\nto serve his purpose:\n\n    Let it lead thee up to heaven, let it lead thee down to hell,\n    The deed shall be done tomorrow: thou shalt have that measureless Gold,\n    And devour the garnered wisdom that blessed thy realm of old,\n    That hath lain unspent and begrudged in the, very heart of hate:\n    With the blood and the might of thy brother thine hunger shalt thou\n            sate:\n    And this deed shall be mine and thine; but take heed for what followeth\n            then!\n\n(P. 119.)\n\nIn still another place has Morris departed far from the saga story.\nAccording to the poem, Sigurd meets each warning of Fafnir that the gold\nwill be the curse of its possessor with the assurance that he will cast\nthe gold abroad, and let none of it cling to his fingers. The saga,\nhowever, has this very frank confession: \"Home would I ride and lose all\nthat wealth, if I deemed that by the losing thereof I should never die;\nbut every brave and true man will fain have his hand on wealth till that\nlast day.\" Here, again, we see an adaptation of the story of the poem to\nmodern conceptions of nobility. It remains to be said that the ernes\nmove Sigurd to take the gold for the gladdening of the world, and they\nassure him that a son of the Volsung had nought to fear from the Curse.\nThe seven-times-repeated \"Bind the red rings, O Sigurd,\" is an admirable\npoem, but it does not contain information concerning Brynhild, as do the\nstrophes of _Reginsmál_ which are the model for this lay.\n\nLet us look at the art of Morris as it is shown in telling \"How Sigurd\nawoke Brynhild upon Hindfell.\" As in the saga, so in the English poem,\nthis incident has a setting most favorable to the display of its\nremarkable beauties. It is a picture as pure and sweet as it has ever\nentered into the mind of man to conceive. The conception belongs to the\npoetic lore of many nations, and children are early introduced to the\nstory of \"Sleeping Beauty.\" There are some features of the Old Norse\nversion that are especially charming, and first among them is the\naddress of the awakened Brynhild to the sun and the earth. We are told\nthat this maiden loved the radiant hero that here awoke her from her\nage-long sleep, but not for him is her first greeting. A finer thrill\nmoves her than love for a man, and in Morris's poem, this feeling finds\nsingularly beautiful expression:\n\n    All hail O Day and thy Sons, and thy kin of the coloured things!\n    Hail, following Night, and thy Daughter that leadeth thy wavering\n            wings!\n    Look down with unangry eyes on us today alive,\n    And give us the hearts victorious, and the gain for which we strive!\n    All hail, ye Lords of God-home, and ye Queens of the House of Gold!\n    Hail thou dear Earth that bearest, and thou Wealth of field and fold!\n    Give us, your noble children, the glory of wisdom and speech,\n    And the hearts and the hands of healing, and the mouths and hands that\n            teach!\n\n(P. 140.)\n\nIn order to see just what the art of Morris has done for this poem, let\nus compare this address with the rendering of the _Sigrdrifumál_, which\ntell the same story and which Morris and Magnusson have incorporated\ninto their translation of the _Völsunga Saga_. The verses are not in the\noriginal saga:\n\n      Hail to the day come back!\n      Hail, sons of the daylight!\n    Hail to thee, dark night, and thy daughter!\n      Look with kind eyes a-down,\n      On us sitting here lonely,\n    And give unto us the gain that we long for.\n      Hail to the Æsir,\n      And the sweet Asyniur!\n    Hail to the fair earth fulfilled of plenty!\n      Fair words, wise hearts,\n      Would we win from you,\n    And healing hands while life we hold.\n\nTo get the full benefit of the comparison of the old and the new, let us\nset in conjunction with these versions a severely literal translation of\nthe _Edda_ strophes themselves:\n\n    Hail, O Day,\n    Hail, O Sons of the Day,\n    Hail Night and kinswoman!\n    With unwroth eyes\n    look on us here\n    and give to us sitting ones victory.\n    Hail, O Gods,\n    Hail, O Goddesses,\n    Hail, O bounteous Earth!\n    Speech and wisdom\n    give to us, the excellent twain,\n    and healing hands during life.\n\nThese stages in the progress of the gold from mine to mint furnish their\nown commentary. The finished product will pass current with the most\nexacting of assayers, as well as gladden the hearts of the poor one\nwhose hand seldom touches gold.\n\nIf the skill of the poet in this case have merited resemblance to that\nof the refiner of gold, what name less than alchemy can characterize his\nachievement in the rest of this scene? From the first words of\nBrynhild's life-story:\n\n    I am she that loveth; I was born of the earthly folk;\n\nto the tender words that tell of the coming of another day:\n\n    And fresh and all abundant abode the deeds of Day,\n\nthere is a succession of beautiful scenes and glorious speeches such as\nonly a master of magic could have gotten out of the original story. The\nEddaic account of the Valkyr's disobedience to All-Father, pictures a\nsaucy and self-willed maiden. Sentence has been pronounced upon her, and\nthus the story continues: \"But I said I would vow a vow against it, and\nmarry no man that knew fear.\" The _Völsunga Saga_ gives exactly the same\naccount, but the poetic version of Morris saves the maiden for our\nrespect and admiration. It is not effrontery, but repentance that speaks\nin the voice of Brynhild here:\n\n    The thoughts of my heart overcame me, and the pride of my wisdom and\n            speech,\n    And I scorned the earth-folk's Framer, and the Lord of the world I must\n            teach.\n\nIn the Icelandic version, Odin makes no speech at the dooming, but\nMorris puts into his mouth this magnificent address:\n\n    And he cried: \"Thou hast thought in thy folly that the Gods have\n            friends and foes,\n    That they wake, and the world wends onward, that they sleep, and\n            the world slips back,\n    That they laugh, and the world's weal waxeth, that they frown and\n            fashion the wrack:\n    Thou hast cast up the curse against me; it shall aback on thine head;\n    Go back to the sons of repentance, with the children of sorrow wed!\n    For the Gods are great unholpen, and their grief is seldom seen,\n    And the wrong that they will and must be is soon as it hath not been.\"\n\n(P. 141.)\n\nMorris has here again exercised the poet's privilege of adding to the\nstory that was the pride of an entire age, in order to serve his own the\nbetter. If he was wise in these additions, he was no less wise in\nsubtractions and in preservations. The saga has a long address by\nBrynhild, opening with mystical advice concerning the power of runes,\nand closing grandly with wise words that sound like a page from the Old\nTestament. The former find no place in _Sigurd the Volsung_, but the\nlatter are turned into mighty phrases that wonderfully preserve the\nspirit of the original.\n\nOne passage more from Book II:\n\n    So they climb the burg of Hindfell, and hand in hand they fare,\n    Till all about and above them is nought but the sunlit air,\n    And there close they cling together rejoicing in their mirth;\n    For far away beneath them lie the kingdoms of the earth,\n    And the garths of men-folk's dwellings and the streams that water them,\n    And the rich and plenteous acres, and the silver ocean's hem,\n    And the woodland wastes and the mountains, and all that holdeth all;\n    The house and the ship and the island, the loom and the mine and the\n            stall,\n    The beds of bane and healing, the crafts that slay and save,\n    The temple of God and the Doom-ring, the cradle and the grave.\n\n(P. 145.)\n\nThese ten lines serve to illustrate very well one of the most remarkable\npowers of Morris. Just consider for a moment the number of details that\nare crowded into this picture, and then notice how few are the strokes\nrequired to put them there. For this rapid painting of a crowded canvas\nMorris is second to none among English poets. This power to put a whole\nlandscape or a complex personality into a few lines is the direct\noutcome of his study of Old Norse literature. Icelandic poetry is\ncharacterized by this quality. One has but to compare the account of the\nend of the world as it is found in the last strophes of _Völuspá_, or in\nthe _Prose Edda_, with the similar account in _Revelations_ to see how\nmuch two languages may differ in this respect. It would seem as if the\nshort verses characteristic of Icelandic poetry forbade lengthy\ndescriptions. The effect must be produced by a number of quick strokes:\nthere is never time to go over a line once made. A simile is never\nelaborated, a new one is made when the poet wishes to insist on the\nfigure. Take the second strophe of the \"Ancient Lay of Gudrun\" as an\nexample, in the translation by Morris and Magnusson:\n\n    Such was my Sigurd\n    Among the Sons of Giuki\n    As is the green leek\n    O'er the low grass waxen,\n    Or a hart high-limbed\n    Over hurrying deer,\n    Or gleed-red gold\n    Over grey silver.\n\nThat is the Icelandic fashion; William Morris has caught it in the\n_Story of Sigurd_. Matthew Arnold has not seen fit to use it in his\n\"Balder Dead,\" as these lines show:\n\n    Him the blind Hoder met, as he came up\n    From the sea cityward, and knew his step;\n    Nor yet could Hermod see his brother's face,\n    For it grew dark; but Hermod touched his arm.\n    And as a spray of honeysuckle flowers\n    Brushes across a tired traveller's face\n    Who shuffles thro the deep-moistened dust,\n    On a May-evening, in the darkened lanes,\n    And starts him that he thinks a ghost went by--\n    So Hoder brushed by Hermod's side.\n\nThese are noble lines, but altogether foreign to Icelandic.\n\nBook III opens with the dream of Gudrun and Brynhild's interpretation of\nit. This matter is managed in accordance with our own standards of art,\nand thus differs materially from the saga story. In the latter a most\nnaïve procedure is adopted, for Brynhild prophesies that Sigurd shall\nleave her for Gudrun, through Grimhild's guile, that strife shall come\nbetween them, and that Sigurd shall die and Gudrun wed Atli. The whole\nlater story is thus revealed. This is not a story-teller's art, but it\nsets clear the Old Norse acceptance of fate's dealings. Of course\nMorris' poetic action explains the dream perfectly, but the details are\nnot so frankly given.\n\n\"Thou shalt live and love and lose, and mingle in murder and war,\" is\nthe gist of Brynhild's message, and the whole future history is there.\n\nThis poem has often been called an epic, and certainly there are many\nepical characteristics in it. One of them is the recurrence of certain\nformulas, and in Books III and IV these are rather more abundant than in\nthe first two books. Thus the sword of Sigurd is praised in the same\nwords, again and again:\n\n    It hath not its like in the heavens nor has earth of its fellow told.\n\nThen, there is the \"cloudy hall-roof\" of the Niblungs. Gudrun is \"the\nwhite-armed\"; Grimhild is \"the wisest of women\"; Hogni is the\n\"wise-heart\"; the Niblungs are \"the Cloudy People\"; their beds are\n\"blue-covered\"; \"the Godson the hangings\" is an expression that recurs\nvery often, and it recalls the fact that Morris was an artisan as well\nas an artist.\n\nIn the preceding books we have noted that Morris lengthened the saga\nstory in his poem by the introduction of speeches that find no place in\nthe original. In this book we see another lengthening process, which,\nwith that already noted, goes far to account for the difference in bulk\nbetween the saga and the poem. Chap. XXVI of the saga, tells in less\nthan a thousands words how Sigurd comes to the Giukings and is wedded to\nGudrun. His reception is told in one hundred words; his abode with the\nGiukings is set forth in even fewer words; Grimhild's plotting and\nadministering of the drugged drink are told in two hundred words; his\nacceptance of Gudrun's hand and her brother's allegiance are as tersely\npictured; kingdoms are conquered, a son is born to Sigurd, and Grimhild\nplots to have Sigurd get Brynhild for her son Gunnar, yet the record of\nit all is compressed within one hundred and fifty words. Of course, the\nmodern poet can hem himself within no such narrow bounds as this. The\nartistic value of these various incidents is priceless, and Morris has\nlingered upon them lovingly and long. He spreads the story over forty\npages, or a thousand lines, and I avow, after a third reading of these\nthree sections of the poem, that I would spare no line of them. How we\nlove this Sigurd of the poet's painting! And what a noble gospel he\nproclaims to the Giukings:\n\n    For peace I bear unto thee, and to all the kings of the earth,\n    Who bear the sword aright, and are crowned with the crown of worth;\n    But unpeace to the lords of evil, and the battle and the death;\n    And the edge of the sword to the traitor, and the flame to the\n            slanderous breath:\n    And I would that the loving were loved, and I would that the weary\n            should sleep,\n    And that man should hearken to man, and that he that soweth should\n            reap.\n\n(P. 174.)\n\nHere, by the way, is the burden of Morris's preaching in the cause of a\nbetter society. It recurs a few pages further on in the poem, where the\nNiblungs bestow praise on this new hero:\n\n    And they say, when the sun of summer shall come aback to the land,\n    It shall shine on the fields of the tiller that fears no heavy hand;\n    That the sleep shall be for the plougher, and the loaf for him that\n            sowed,\n    Through every furrowed acre where the Son of Sigmund rode.\n\n(P. 178.)\n\nIt need hardly be remarked that this Sigurd is not the sagaman's ideal.\nThe Icelanders never evolved such high conceptions of man's obligations\nto man, but in their ignorance they were no worse off than their\ncontinental brethren, for these forgot their greatest Teacher's\nteaching, and modern social science must point them back to it.\n\nThis Sigurd that we love becomes the Sigurd that we pity in the drinking\nof a draught. Sorrow takes the place of joy in his life, and \"the soul\nis changed in him,\" so that men may say that on this day they saw him\ndie the first time, who was to die a second time by Guttorm's sword.\nGloom spreads over all the earth with the quenching of Sigurd's joy:\n\n    In the deedless dark he rideth, and all things he remembers save one,\n    And nought else hath he care to remember of all the deeds he hath done.\n\nHere is illustrated the essential difference between the sagaman's art\nand the modern story-teller's. The Icelander must tell his story in\nhaste; the deeds of men are his care, not their divagations nor their\npsychologizings. The modern writer must linger on every step in the\nstory until the motive and the meaning are laid bare. In the present-day\nversion Sigurd's mental sufferings are described at length, and our\nhearts are wrung at his unmerited woes. The saga knows no such woes, and\nto all appearance Sigurd's life is not unhappy to its very end. Indeed,\nit appears in more than one place in Morris's poem that Sigurd has\nbecome godlike through the hard experiences of his life. Take this\npassage as an illustration:\n\n    So is Sigurd yet with the Niblungs, and he loveth Gudrun his wife,\n    And wendeth afield with the brethren to the days of the dooming of\n            life;\n    And nought his glory waneth, nor falleth the flood of praise:\n    To every man he hearkeneth, nor gainsayeth any grace,\n    And, glad is the poor in the Doom-ring when he seeth his face mid\n            the Kings,\n    For the tangle straighteneth before him, and the maze of crooked\n            things.\n    But the smile is departed from him, and the laugh of Sigurd the\n            young,\n    And of few words now is he waxen, and his songs are seldom sung.\n    Howbeit of all the sad-faced was Sigurd loved the best;\n    And men say: Is the king's heart mighty beyond all hope of rest?\n    Lo, how he beareth the people! how heavy their woes are grown!\n    So oft were a God mid the Goth-folk, if he dwelt in the world alone.\n\n(P. 205.)\n\nSet this by the side of the saga: \"This is truer,\" says Sigurd, \"that I\nloved thee better than myself, though I fell into the wiles from whence\nour lives may not escape; for whenso my own heart and mind availed me,\nthen I sorrowed sore that thou wert not my wife; but as I might I put my\ntrouble from me, for in a king's dwelling was I; and withal and in spite\nof all I was well content that we were all together. Well may it be,\nthat that shall come to pass which is foretold; neither shall I fear the\nfulfilment thereof.\" (_Völunga Saga_, Chap. XXIX.) These words are\nspoken to Brynhild after she has discovered what she regards as Sigurd's\ntreachery. His words are dictated by a noble resignation to fate, but\nhis very next remark shows a moral meanness not at all in keeping with\nMorris's conception. Sigurd said: \"This my heart would, that thou and I\nshould go into one bed together; even so wouldst thou be my wife.\"\n\nThere have been many griefs depicted in this poem, but surely here are\nset forth the most pitiless of them all. The guile-won Brynhild travels\nin state to the Cloudy Hall of the Niblungs, and the whole people come\nout to meet her. They are astonished at her beauty, and give her cordial\ngreeting and welcome to her husband's house. Proud and majestic, the\nmarvelous woman steps from her golden wain, and gives friendly but\npassionless greeting to Gunnar as she places her hand in his. For each\nof Gunnar's brothers she has a kindly word, as she has for Grimhild,\ntoo. She asks to see the foster-brother of whom such wondrous tales are\ntold, and whose name she heard from Gunnar's lips with never a\ntremor--\"Sigurd, the Volsung, the best man ever born.\" Grimhild stands\nbetween them for a time, but the meeting has to come. Then Brynhild\nremembers, and Sigurd sees the unveiled past:\n\n    Her heart ran back through the years, and yet her lips did move\n    With the words she spake on Hindfell, when they plighted troth of love.\n\n     .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\n\n    His face is exceeding glorious and awful to behold;\n    For of all his sorrow he knoweth and his hope smit dead and cold:\n\n     .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\n\n    For the will of the Norns is accomplished, and outworn is Grimhild's\n            spell\n    And nought now shall blind or help him, and the tale shall be to tell.\n\n(P. 226.)\n\nThere's the note of the whole history--the will of the Norns and the\nnote of a whole Northern literature, as it is of a whole Southern\nliterature. Man, the puppet, in the hands of Fate; however man may think\nand reason and assure himself that the dispensation of Fate is just, the\nsupreme moment of realization will always be a tragedy:\n\n    He hath seen the face of Brynhild, and he knows why she hath come,\n    And that his is the hand that hath drawn her to the Cloudy People's\n            home:\n    He knows of the net of the days, and the deeds that the Gods have bid,\n    And no whit of the sorrow that shall be from his wakened soul is hid.\n\n(P. 226.)\n\nIn such an hour, what are conquests of a glorious past, what are honors,\ncrowns, loves, hates? The mind can think of little matters only:\n\n    His heart speeds back to Hindfell, and the dawn of the wakening day;\n    And the hours betwixt are as nothing, and their deeds are fallen away.\n\n(P. 226.)\n\nIs aught to be said to one in such a crisis, the words are weak and\ncommonplace. There is Brynhild's greeting to Sigurd:\n\n    If aught thy soul shall desire while yet thou livest on earth,\n    I pray that thou mayst win it, nor forget its might and worth.\n\nThe shattered mind of Sigurd tries to grasp the meaning of the harmless\nwords, and like common sounds that are so fearful in the night, the\nphrases assume a terrible import:\n\n    All grief, sharp scorn, sore longing, stark death in her voice he knew.\n\nThen again conies the dominant note of this story:\n\n    Gone forth is the doom of the Norns, and what shall be answer thereto,\n    While the death that amendeth lingers?\n\nHere is a hint of the end of all--\"the death that amendeth,\" and from\nthis point to the end of the story there is no gleam of happiness for\nanyone.\n\nBook IV brings to a majestic close this mighty history. We have dwelt so\nlong on the wonderful poetry of the other books that we must refrain\nfrom further comment in this strain. As we read these eloquent\nimaginings, we regret that the English reading public have left this\nwork through fear of its great length or the ignorance of its existence,\nin the dust of half-forgotten shelves. Gold disused is true gold none\nthe less, and the ages to come may be more appreciative than the\npresent.\n\nFor the sake of rounding out this story, be it noted concerning this\nBook IV, that the poet has taken liberties with the saga story here, as\nelsewhere. Motives more easily understood in our day are assigned for\nthe deeds of dread that throng these closing scenes. Gudrun weds King\nAtli at her mother's bidding, and under the influence of a wicked\npotion, but neither mother nor magic drives the memory of Sigurd from\nher mind. She lives to bring destruction upon her husband's murderers,\nand those murderers are her own flesh and blood. Through her appeals to\nAtli's greed, and through Knefrud's lies in the Niblung court, the visit\nof her proud brothers to her pliant husband is brought about. The saga\nmakes Atli the arch-plotter, and the motive his desire to possess the\ngold. This sentence exculpates Gudrun from any wrong intention towards\nher brothers: \"Now the queen wots of their conspiring, and misdoubts her\nthat this would mean some beguiling of her brethren.\" (Chap. XXXIV.) In\nChap. XXXVIII, we are told that Gudrun fights on the side of her\nbrothers. We see at once the superiority of the poet's motive for a\nmodern tragedy.\n\nIt is impressed upon the reader of an epic that the plan of its maker\ndoes not call for fine analysis of character. The epic poet is concerned\nnecessarily with large considerations, and his personages do not split\nhairs from the south to the southeast side. One sign of this is seen in\nthe epic formulæ employed to characterize the personages of the story.\nSuch formulas are in _Sigurd the Volsung_ in abundance, as we have noted\non another page. But there are also many departures from the epic model\nin this poem. Some of these we have referred to in the remarks on Book\nIII, where we noted Sigurd's mental sufferings. In Book IV we have a\ndiscrimination of character that is not epic, but dramatic in its\nminuteness. In the speech and the deeds of the Niblungs their pride and\nselfishness is clearly set forth, but the individual members of that\nrace are distinguished by traits very minutely drawn. Thus Hogni is the\nwary Niblung, and is averse to accepting Atli's invitation:\n\n    \"I know not, I know not,\" said Hogni, \"but an unsure bridge is the sea,\n    And such would I oft were builded betwixt my foeman and me.\n    I know a sorrow that sleepeth, and a wakened grief I know,\n    And the torment of the mighty is a strong and fearful foe.\"\n\n(P. 281.)\n\nGunnar is here distinguished as a hypocrite by word and deed; Gudrun\nremembers Sigurd in her exile and schemes and plots to make her husband\nAtli work her vengeance on the Niblungs; Atli is greedy for gold and\nGudrun's task is not hard; Knefrud is a liar whose words are winning,\nand overcome the scruples of the Niblungs. In these careful\ndiscriminations of character we see a non-epical trait, and of necessity\ntherefore, a non-Icelandic trait. The sagaman was epic in his tone.\n\nAs a last appreciation of the art of William Morris as it is displayed\nin this poem, we would call attention to the tremendous battle-piece\nentitled \"Of the Battle in Atli's Hall.\" It is the climax of this\nmarvelous poem, and in no detail is it inadequate to its place in the\nwork. The poet's constructive power is here demonstrated to be of the\nhighest order, and in the majestic sweep of events that is here\ndepicted, we see the poet in his original role of _maker_. The sagaman's\nskill had not the power to conceive this titanic drama, and the memory\nof his battle-piece is quite effaced by the modern invention. In blood\nand fire the story comes to an end with Gudrun,\n\n    The white and silent woman above the slaughter set.\n\nAs we turn from the scene and the book, that figure fades not away. And\nit is fitting that the last memory of this poem should be a picture of\nlove and hate, inextricably bound together, for that is the irony of\nFate, and Fate was mistress of the Old Norseman's world.\n\n\n5.\n\nBetween the great works dealt with in the last two sections, which\nbelong together and were therefore so considered, came the book of 1875,\nbearing the title _Three Northern Love Stories and Other Tales_. It is\nas good a representation as Iceland can make in the love-story class.\n\nThese tales are charmingly told in the translation of Morris and\nMagnusson, the second one, \"Frithiof the Bold,\" being a master-piece in\nits kind. Men will dare much for the love of a woman, and that is why\nthe sagaman records love episodes at all. Frithiof's voyage to the\nOrkneys in Chap. VI is a stormpiece that vies with anything of its kind\nin modern literature. It is Norse to the core, and we love the peerless\nyoung hero who forgets not his manhood in his chagrin of defeat at love.\nSurely there is fitness in these outbursts of song in moments of extreme\nexultation or despair! \"And he sang withal:\n\n    \"Helgi it is that helpeth\n    The white-head billows' waxing;\n    Cold time unlike the kissing\n    In the close of Baldur's Meadow!\n    So is the hate of Helgi\n    To that heart's love she giveth.\n    O would that here I held her,\n    Gift high above all giving!\"\n\nModern literature has lost this conventionality of the older writings,\nfound in Hebrew as well as in Icelandic, and we think it has lost\nsomething valuable. Morris thought so, too, for he restored the\ninterpolated song-snatches in his Romances. We are tempted to dwell on\nthese three love-stories, they are so fine; but we must leave them with\nthe remark that they show the poet's appreciation of the worth of a\nforeign literature, and his great desire to have his countrymen share in\nhis admiration for them. \"The Story of Gunnlaug the Worm-Tongue and\nRaven the Skald,\" and \"The Story of Viglund the Fair,\" are the other two\nstories that give the title to the volume, representing the thirteenth\nand fifteenth centuries, as \"Frithiof\" represented the fourteenth.\n\n6.\n\nWith _Sigurd the Volsung_ ended the first great Icelandic period of\nMorris's work. More than a dozen years passed before he returned to the\nfield, and from 1889 until his death, in 1896, everything he wrote bore\nproofs of his abiding interest in and affection for the ancient\nliterature. The remarkable series of romances, _The House of the\nWolfings_ (1889), _The Roots of the Mountains_ (1890), _The Story of the\nGlittering Plain_ (1891), _The Wood Beyond the World_ (1895), _The Well\nat the World's End_ (1896) and _The Sundering Flood_ (posthumous), are\nnone of them distinctively Old Norse in geography or in story, but they\nall have the flavor of the saga-translations, and are all the better for\nit. They are as original and as beautiful as the poet's tapestries and\nfurniture, and if they did not provoke imitation as did the tapestries\nand furniture, it was not because they were not worth imitating: more\nthan likely there were no imitators equal to the task. In these romances\nwe have men and women with the characteristics of an olden time that are\nmost worthy of conservation in the present time. The ideals of womanfolk\nand manfolk in _The House of the Wolfings_ and _The Roots of the\nMountains_, for instance, are such as an Englishman might well be proud\nto have in his remote ancestry. Hall-Sun, Wood-Sun, Sunbeam, and Bowmay\nare wholesome women to meet in a story, and Thiodolf, Gold-mane,\nIron-face and Hallward are every inch men for book-use or to commune\nwith every day. Weaklings, too, abide in these stories, and Penny-thumb\nand Rusty and Fiddle and Wood-grey lend humanity to the company.\n\nThe two romances last mentioned are so steeped in the atmosphere of the\nsagas, that what with folk-motes and shut-beds, and byres, and\nman-quellers, and handsels and speech-friends, we seem to lose ourselves\nin yet another version of a northern tale. Morris retains the old idiom\nthat he invented for his translations, and keeps the tyro thumbing his\ndictionary, but the charm is increased by the archaisms. As one seeks\nthe words in the dictionary, one learns that Chaucer, Spenser and the\nBallads were the wells from which he drew these rare words, and that his\nemployment of them is only another phase of his love for the old far-off\nthings. It is true that the language of Morris is not of any one\nstadium of English, but it is a poet's privilege to draw upon all\nhistory for his words as well as for his allusions, and the revivals in\nquestion are of worthy words pushed aside by the press of newer, but not\nnecessarily better forms.\n\nThese works are the kind that show the influence of Old Norse literature\nas spiritual rather than substantial. The stories are not drawn from the\nolder literature, nor are the settings patterned after it; but the\nimpulses that swayed men and women in the sagaman's tale, and the\nmotives that uplifted them, are found here. We cannot think that the\nEnglish people will always be unmindful of the great debt that they owe\nto the Muse of the North.\n\n\n7.\n\nIn 1891, Morris engaged in a literary enterprise that set the fashion\nfor similar enterprises in succeeding years. With Eirikr Magnusson he\nundertook the making of _The Saga Library_, \"addressed to the whole\nreading public, and not only to students of Scandinavian history,\nfolk-lore and language.\"[33] With Bernard Quaritch's imprint on the\ntitle pages, these volumes to the number of five were issued in\nexceptional type and form. The munificence of the publisher was equalled\nby the skill of the translators, and in their versions of \"Howard, the\nHalt,\" \"The Banded Men,\" and \"Hen Thorir\" (in Vol. I, dated 1891), \"The\nEre-Dwellers\" (in Vol. II, dated 1892) and _Heimskringla_ (in Vols. III,\nIV and V, dated 1893-4-5), the definitive translations of sterling sagas\nwere given. As was the case with their _Grettis Saga_, the works rise to\nthe dignity of masterpieces, and had we no other legacy from Morris'\nwealth of Icelandic scholarship, these translations were precious enough\nto keep us grateful through many generations.\n\n\n8.\n\nOne more contribution to English literature hailing from the North, and\nwe have done with William Morris's splendid gifts. The volume of 1891,\nentitled _Poems by the Way_, contains several pieces that must be\nreckoned with. The vividest recollections of Icelandic materials here\nmade use of are the poems \"Iceland First Seen,\" and \"To the Muses of the\nNorth.\" No reader of the poet's biography can forget the remarkable\njourney that Morris made through Iceland, nor how he prepared for that\njourney with all the care and love of a pilgrim bound for a shrine of\nhis deepest devotion. Every foot of ground was visited that had been\nhallowed by the noble souls and inspiring deeds of the past, and that\npilgrimage warmed him to loving literary creation through the remainder\nof his life. The last two stanzas of the first of the poems just\nmentioned show what a strong hold the forsaken island had upon his\naffections, and go far to explain the success of his Icelandic work:\n\n    O Queen of the grief without knowledge,\n    of the courage that may not avail,\n    Of the longing that may not attain,\n    of the love that shall never forget,\n    More joy than the gladness of laughter\n    thy voice hath amidst of its wail:\n    More hope than of pleasure fulfilled\n    amidst of thy blindness is set;\n    More glorious than gaining of all\n    thine unfaltering hand that shall fail:\n    For what is the mark on thy brow\n    but the brand that thy Brynhild doth bear?\n    Lone once, and loved and undone\n    by a love that no ages outwear.\n\n    Ah! when thy Balder conies back,\n    and bears from the heart of the Sun\n    Peace and the healing of pain,\n    and the wisdom that waiteth no more;\n    And the lilies are laid on thy brow\n    'mid the crown of the deeds thou hast done;\n    And the roses spring up by thy feet\n    that the rocks of the wilderness wore.\n    Ah! when thy Balder comes back\n    and we gather the gains he hath won,\n    Shall we not linger a little\n    to talk of thy sweetness of old,\n    Yea, turn back awhile to thy travail\n    whence the Gods stood aloof to behold?\n\nIn several other poems in this volume he recurs to the practice of his\nromances, Scandinavianizes where the tendency of other poets would be\nto mediævalize. \"Of the Wooing of Hallbiorn the Strong,\" and \"The Raven\nand the King's Daughter\" are examples. Here we have ballads like those\nthat Coleridge and Keats conceived on occasion, full of the beauty that\nlends itself so kindly to painted-glass decoration; clustered\nspear-shafts, crested helms and curling banners, and everywhere lily\nhands combing yellow hair or broidering silken standards. But the names\nstrike a strange note in these songs of Morris, and the accompaniments\nare very different from the mediæval kind:\n\n    Come ye carles of the south country,\n    Now shall we go our kin to see!\n    For the lambs are bleating in the south,\n    And the salmon swims towards Olfus mouth.\n    Girth and graithe and gather your gear!\n    And ho for the other Whitewater![34]\n\nThe introduction of the homely arts of bread-winning distinguishes the\nromance of Scandinavia from the romance of Southern Europe, and here\nMorris struck into a new field for poetry. Wherever we turn to note the\neffects of Icelandic tradition, we find this presence of daily toil,\nalways associated with dignity, never apologized for. The connection\nbetween Morris' art and Morris' socialism is not hard to explain.\n\nNo commentary can equal Morris' own poem, \"To the Muse of the North,\" in\nsetting forth the charm that drew him to the literature of Iceland:\n\n    O Muse that swayest the sad Northern Song,\n    Thy right hand full of smiting and of wrong,\n    Thy left hand holding pity; and thy breast\n    Heaving with hope of that so certain rest:\n    Thou, with the grey eyes kind and unafraid,\n    The soft lips trembling not, though they have said\n    The doom of the World and those that dwell therein.\n    The lips that smile not though thy children win\n    The fated Love that draws the fated Death.\n    O, borne adown the fresh stream of thy breath,\n    Let some word reach my ears and touch my heart,\n    That, if it may be, I may have a part\n    In that great sorrow of thy children dead\n    That vexed the brow, and bowed adown the head,\n    Whitened the hair, made life a wondrous dream,\n    And death the murmur of a restful stream,\n    But left no stain upon those souls of thine\n    Whose greatness through the tangled world doth shine.\n    O Mother, and Love and Sister all in one,\n    Come thou; for sure I am enough alone\n    That thou thine arms about my heart shouldst throw,\n    And wrap me in the grief of long ago.\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\nIN THE LATTER DAYS.\n\nECHOES OF ICELAND IN LATER POETS.\n\n\nAfter William Morris the northern strain that we have been listening for\nin the English poets seems feeble and not worth noting. Nevertheless, it\nmust be remarked that in the harp of a thousand strings that wakes to\nmusic under the bard's hands, there is a sweep which thrills to the\nancient traditions of the Northland. Now and then the poet reaches for\nthese strings, and gladdens us with some reminiscence of\n\n        old, unhappy, far-off things\n    And battles long ago.\n\nAs had already been intimated, the table of contents in a present-day\nvolume of poetry is very apt to show an Old Norse title. Thus Robert\nLord Lytton's _Poems Historical and Characteristic_ (London, 1877)\nreveals among the poems on European, Oriental, classic and mediaeval\nsubjects, \"The Death of Earl Hacon,\" a strong piece inspired by an\nincident in _Heimskringla_. In Robert Buchanan's multifarious versifying\noccurs this title: \"Balder the Beautiful, A Song of Divine Death,\" but\nonly the title is Old Norse; nothing in the poem suggests that origin\nexcept a notion or two of the end of all things. \"Hakon\" is the title of\na short virile piece more nearly of the Norse spirit. Sidney Dobell's\ndrama _Balder_ has only the title to suggest the Icelandic, but Gerald\nMassey has the true ring in a number of lyrics, with themes drawn from\nthe records of Norway's relations with England. In \"The Norseman\" there\nis a trumpet strain that recalls the best of the border-ballads; there\nis also a truthfulness of portraiture that argues a poet's, intuition in\nGerald Massey, if not an acquaintance with the sagas:\n\n    The Norseman's King must stand up tall,\n    If he would be head over all;\n    Mainmast of Battle! when the plain\n    Is miry-red with bloody rain!\n    And grip his weapon for the fight,\n    Until his knuckles grin tooth-white,\n    The banner-staff he bears is best\n    If double handful for the rest:\n      When \"follow me\" cries the Norseman.\n\nHe knows the gentler side of Old Norse character, too, a side which, as\nwe have seen, was not suspected till Carlyle came:\n\n    He hides at heart of his rough life,\n    A world of sweetness for the Wife;\n    From his rude breast a Babe may press\n    Soft milk of human tenderness,--\n    Make his eyes water, his heart dance,\n    And sunrise in his countenance:\n    In merriest mood his ale he quaffs\n    By firelight, and with jolly heart laughs\n      The blithe, great-hearted Norseman.\n\nThe poem \"Old King Hake,\" is as strikingly true in characterization as\nthe preceding. In half a dozen strophes Massey has told a whole saga,\nand has found time, too, to describe \"an iron hero of Norse mould.\" How\nmiserable a personage is the Italian that flits through Browning's pages\nwhen contrasted with this hero:\n\n    When angry, out the blood would start\n      With old King Hake;\n    Not sneak in dark caves of the heart,\n      Where curls the snake,\n    And secret Murder's hiss is heard\n      Ere the deed be done:\n    He wove no web of wile and word;\n      He bore with none.\n    When sharp within its sheath asleep\n      Lay his good sword,\n    He held it royal work to keep\n      His kingly word.\n    A man of valour, bloody and wild,\n      In Viking need;\n    And yet of firelight feeling mild\n      As honey-mead.\n\nAnother poem, \"The Banner-Bearer of King Olaf,\" pictures the strong\nfighter in a death he rejoiced to die. It is a good poem of the class\nthat nerves men to die for the flag, and it has the Old Norse spirit.\nThese poems are all from Massey's volume _My Lyrical Life_ (London.\n1889).\n\nA glance at the other poems in Gerald Massey's volumes shows that like\nMorris, and like Kingsley, and like Carlyle, the poet was a workman\neager to do for the workman. Is it not suggestive that these men found\nthemselves drawn to Old Norse character and life? The Icelandic republic\ncherished character as the highest quality of citizenship, and put few\nor no social obstacles in the way of its achievement. The literature\ninspired by that life reveals a fellowship among the members of that\nrepublic that is the envy of social reformers of the present day. Morris\nmakes one of the personages in _The Story of the Glittering Plain_\n(Chap. I) say these words: \"And as for Lord, I knew not this word, for\nhere dwell we the Sons of the Raven in good fellowship, with our wives\nthat we have wedded, and our mothers who have borne us, and our sisters\nwho serve us.\" Almost may this description serve for Iceland in its\ngolden age, and so it is no wonder that the socialist, the priest, and\nthe philosopher of our own disjointed times go back to the sagas for\nideals to serve their countrymen.\n\nWe have no other poets to mention by name in connection with this Old\nNorse influence, although doubtless a search through the countless\nvolumes that the presses drop into a cold and uncaring world would\nreveal other poems with Scandinavian themes. We close this section of\nour investigation with the remark already made, that, in the tables of\ntitles in volumes of contemporary verse, acknowledgment to Old Norse\npoetry and prose are not the rarity they once were, and in poems of any\nkind allusions to the same sources are very common.\n\n\n\nRECENT TRANSLATIONS.\n\n\nWe have already noted the beginning of serial publications of saga\ntranslations, namely, Morris and Magnusson's _Saga Library_ which was\nstopped by the death of Morris when the fifth volume had been completed.\nBy the last decade of the nineteenth century Icelandic had become one of\nthe languages that an ordinary scholar might boast, and in consequence\nthe list of translations began to lengthen very fast. Several English\npublishers with scholarly instincts were attracted to this field, and\nso the reading public may get at the sagas that were so long the\nexclusive possession of learned professors. _The Northern Library_,\npublished by David Nutt, of London, already contains four volumes and\nmore are promised: _The Saga of King Olaf Tryggwason,_ by J. Sephton,\nappeared in 1895; _The Tale of Thrond of Gate_ (_Færeyinga Saga_), by F.\nYork Powell, in 1896; _Hamlet in Iceland_ (_Ambales Saga_), by Israel\nGollancz, in 1898; _The Saga of King Sverri of Norway_ (_Sverris Saga_),\nby J. Sephton, in 1899. If we cannot give to these the praise of being\ngreat literature though translations, we can at least foresee that this\nprocess of turning all the readable sagas into English will quicken\nadaptations and increase the stock of allusions in modern writings.\n\nAn example of the publishers' feeling that the reading public will find\nan interest in the saga itself, is the translation of _Laxdæla Saga_ by\nMuriel A.C. Press (London, 1899, J.M. Dent & Co.). William Morris made\nthis saga known to readers of English poetry by his magnificent \"Lovers\nof Gudrun.\" Mrs. Press lets us see the story in its original form.\nPerhaps this translation will appeal as widely as any to those who read,\nand we may note the differences between this form of writing and that to\nwhich the modern times are accustomed.\n\nThis saga is a story, but it is not like the work of fiction, nor like\nthe sketch of history which appeals to our interest to-day. It has not\nthe unity of purpose which marks the novel, nor the broad outlook over\nevents which characterizes the history. Plotting is abundant, but plot\nin the technical sense there is none. Events are recorded in\nchronological order, but there is no march of those events to a\n_denouement_. While it would be wrong to say that there is no one hero\nin a saga, it would be more correct to say that that hero's name is\nlegion. From generation to generation a saga-history wends its way, each\nperiod dominated by a great hero. The annals of a family edited for\npurposes of oral recitation, or the life of the principal member of that\nfamily with an introduction dealing with the great deeds of as many of\nhis ancestors as he would be proud to own--this seems to be what a saga\nwas--_Laxdæla_, _Grettla_, _Njala_.\n\nThis form permits many sterling literary qualities. Movement is the\nmost marked characteristic. This was essential to a spoken story, and\nthe sharpest impression left in the mind of an English reader is that of\nrelentless activity. Thus he finds it necessary to keep the bearings of\nthe story by consulting the list of _dramatis personæ_ and the map, both\nindispensable accompaniments of a saga-translation. The chapter headings\nmake this list, and a glance at them for _Laxdæla_ reveals a procession\nof notable personages--Ketill, Unn, Hoskuld, Olaf the Peacock, Kiartan,\nGudrun, Bolli, Thorgills, Thorkell, Thorleik, Bolli Bollison and Snorri.\nEach of these is, in turn, the center of action, and only Gudrun keeps\nprominent for any length of time.\n\nCharacter-portraiture, ever a remarkable achievement in literature, is\nexcellently done in the sagas. There was a necessity for this; so many\npersonages crowded the stage that, if they were not to be mere puppets,\nthey would have to be carefully discriminated. That they were so a\nperusal of any saga will prove.\n\nIn a novel love is almost indispensable; in a saga other forces are the\nimpelling motives. Love-making gets the novelist's tenderest interest\nand solicitude, but it receives little attention from the sagaman.\nWooing under the Arctic Circle was a methodical bargaining, and there\nwas little room for sentiment. When Thorvald asked for Osvif's daughter\nGudrun, the father \"said that against the match it would tell that he\nand Gudrun were not of equal standing. Thorvald spoke gently and said he\nwas wooing a wife, not money. After that Gudrun was betrothed to\nThorvald.... He should also bring her jewels, so that no woman of equal\nwealth should have better to show.... Gudrun was not asked about it and\ntook it much to heart, yet things went on quietly.\" (Chap. XXXIV of\n_Laxdæla_.) In Iceland, as elsewhere, love was a source of discord, and\nfor that reason love is always present in the saga. It is not the tender\npassion there, silvered with moonlight and attended by song. The saga is\na man's tale.\n\nThe translation just referred to is in _The Temple Classics_, published\nby J.M. Dent & Co., London, 1899, and edited by Israel Gollancz. The\neditor promises (p. 273) other sagas in this form, if Mrs. Press's work\nprove successful. He speaks of _Njala_ and _Volsunga_ as imminent. It is\nto be hoped that the intention is to give the Dasent and the Morris\nversions, for they cannot be excelled.\n\n\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote 1: Quoted in Gray, by E.W.

VI\n\nTHE DRAPIER'S LETTERS\n\nLONDON\n\nGEORGE BELL AND SONS\n\n1903\n\nCHISWICK PRESS CHARLES WHITTINGHAM AND CO\nTOOKS COURT, CHANCERY LANE, LONDON\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn 1714 Swift left England for Ireland, disappointed, distressed, and\nworn out with anxiety in the service of the Harley Ministry. On his\ninstallation as Dean of St. Patrick's he had been received in Dublin\nwith jeering and derision. He had even been mocked at in his walks\nabroad. In 1720, however, he entered for the second time the field of\nactive political polemics, and began with renewed energy the series of\nwritings which not only placed him at the head and front of the\npolitical writers of the day, but secured for him a place in the\naffections of the people of Ireland--a place which has been kept sacred\nto him even to the present time. A visitor to the city of Dublin\ndesirous of finding his way to St. Patrick's Cathedral need but to ask\nfor the Dean's Church, and he will be understood. There is only one\nDean, and he wrote the \"Drapier's Letters.\" The joy of the people of\nDublin on the withdrawal of Wood's Patent found such permanent\nexpression, that it has descended as oral tradition, and what was\nomitted from the records of Parliament and the proceedings of Clubs and\nAssociations founded in the Drapier's honour, has been embalmed in the\nhearts of the people, whose love he won, and whose homage it was ever\nhis pride to accept.\n\nThe spirit of Swift which Grattan invoked had, even in Grattan's time,\npower to stir hearts to patriotic enthusiasm. That spirit has not died\nout yet, and the Irish people still find it seasonable and refreshing to\nbe awakened by it to a true sense of the dignity and majesty of\nIreland's place in the British Empire.\n\nA dispassionate student of the condition of Ireland between the years\nof Swift's birth and death--between, say, 1667 and 1745--could rise from\nthat study in no unprejudiced mood. It would be difficult for him to\navoid the conclusion that the government of Ireland by England had not\nonly degraded the people of the vassal nation, but had proved a disgrace\nand a stigma on the ruling nation. It was a government of the masses by\nthe classes, for no other than selfish ends. It ended, as all such\ngovernments must inevitably end, in impoverishing the people, in\nwholesale emigration, in starvation and even death, in revolt, and in\nfostering among those who remained, and among those whom circumstances\nexiled, the dangerous spirit of resentment and rebellion which is the\noutcome of the sense of injustice. It has also served, even to this day,\nto give vitality to those associations that have from time to time\narisen in Ireland for the object of realizing that country's\nself-government.\n\nIt may be argued that the people of Ireland of that time justified\nSwift's petition when he prayed to be removed from \"this land of slaves,\nwhere all are fools and all are knaves\"; but that is no justification\nfor the injustice. The injustice from which Ireland suffered was a fact.\nIts existence was resented with all the indignation with which an\nemotional and spiritual people will always resent material obstructions\nto the free play of what they feel to be their best powers.\n\nThere were no leaders at the time who could see this, and seeing it,\nenforce its truth on the dull English mind to move it to saner methods\nof dealing with this people. Nor were there any who could order the\nresentment into battalions of fighting men to give point to the demands\nfor equal rights with their English fellow-subjects.\n\nHad Swift been an Irishman by nature as he was by birth, it might have\nbeen otherwise; but Swift was an Irishman by accident, and only became\nan Irish patriot by reason of the humanity in him which found indignant\nand permanent expression against oppression. Swift's indignation\nagainst the selfish hypocrisy of his fellow-men was the cry from the\npain which the sight of man's inhumanity to man inflicted on his\nsensitive and truth-loving nature. The folly and baseness of his\nfellow-creatures stung him, as he once wrote to Pope, \"to perfect rage\nand resentment.\" Turn where he would, he found either the knave as the\nslave driver, or the slave as a fool, and the latter became even a\nwilling sacrifice. His indignation at the one was hardly greater than\nhis contempt for the other, and his different feelings found trenchant\nexpression in such writings as the \"Drapier's Letters,\" the \"Modest\nProposal,\" and \"Gulliver's Travels.\"\n\nIt has been argued that the _saeva indignatio_ which lacerated his heart\nwas the passion of a mad man. To argue thus seems to us to misunderstand\nentirely the peculiar qualities of Swift's nature. It was not the mad\nman that made the passion; it was rather the passion that made the man\nmad. As we understand him, it seems to us that Swift's was an eminently\nmajestic spirit, moved by the tenderest of human sympathies, and capable\nof ennobling love--a creature born to rule and to command, but with all\nthe noble qualities which go to make a ruler loved. It happened that\ncircumstances placed him early in his career into poverty and servitude.\nHe extricated himself from both in time; but his liberation was due to\nan assertion of his best powers, and not to a dissimulation of them. Had\nhe been less honest, he might have risen to a position of great power,\nbut it would have been at the price of those very qualities which made\nhim the great man he was. That assertion cost him his natural vocation,\nand Swift lived on to rage in the narrow confines of a Dublin Deanery\nHouse. He might have flourished as the greatest of English statesmen--he\nbecame instead a monster, a master-scourger of men, pitiless to them as\nthey had been blind to him. But monster and master-scourger as he proved\nhimself, he always took the side of the oppressed as against the\noppressor. The impulse which sent him abroad collecting guineas for\n\"poor Harrison\" was the same impulse which moved him in his study at the\nDeanery to write as \"M.B. Drapier.\" On this latter occasion, however, he\nalso had an opportunity to lay bare the secret springs of oppression, an\nopportunity which he was not the man to let go by.\n\nNo doubt Swift was not quite disinterested in the motives which prompted\nhim to enter the political arena for the second time. He hated the\nWalpole Ministry in power; he resented his exile in a country whose\npeople he despised; and he scorned the men who, while they feared him,\nhad yet had the power to prevent his advancement. But, allowing for\nthese personal incentives, there was in Swift such a large sympathy for\nthe degraded condition of the Irish people, such a tender solicitude for\ntheir best welfare, and such a deep-seated zeal for their betterment,\nthat, in measuring to him his share in the title of patriot, we cannot\nbut admit that what we may call his public spirit far outweighed his\nprivate spleen. Above all things Swift loved liberty, integrity,\nsincerity and justice; and if it be that it was his love for these,\nrather than his love for the country, which inspired him to patriotic\nefforts, who shall say that he does not still deserve well of us. If a\npatriot be a man who nobly teaches a people to become aware of its\nhighest functions as a nation, then was Swift a great patriot, and he\nbetter deserves that title than many who have been accorded it.\n\nThe matter of Wood's Halfpence was a trivial one in itself; but it was\njust that kind of a matter which Swift must instantly have appreciated\nas the happiest for his purpose. It was a matter which appealed to the\ncommonest news-boy on the street, and its meaning once made plain, the\nprinciple which gave vitality to the meaning was ready for enunciation\nand was assured of intelligent acceptance. In writing the \"Drapier's\nLetters,\" he had, to use his own words, seasonably raised a spirit\namong the Irish people, and that spirit he continued to refresh, until\nwhen he told them in his Fourth Letter, \"by the Laws of God, of Nature,\nof Nations, and of your Country, you are, and ought to be, as free a\npeople as your brethren in England,\" the country rose as one man to the\nappeal. Neither the suavities of Carteret nor the intrigues of Walpole\nhad any chance against the set opposition which met them. The question\nto be settled was taken away from the consideration of ministers, and\nout of the seclusion of Cabinets into the hands of the People, and\nbefore the public eye. There was but one way in which it could be\nsettled--the way of the people's will--and it went that way. It does not\nat all matter that Walpole finally had his way--that the King's mistress\npocketed her _douceur_, and that Wood retired satisfied with the ample\ncompensation allowed him. What does matter is that, for the first time\nin Irish History, a spirit of national life was breathed into an almost\ndenationalized people. Beneath the lean and starved ribs of death Swift\nplanted a soul; it is for this that Irishmen will ever revere his\nmemory.\n\nIn the composition of the \"Letters\" Swift had set himself a task\npeculiarly fitting to his genius. Those qualities of mind which enabled\nhim to enter into the habits of the lives of footmen, servants, and\nlackeys found an even more congenial freedom of play here. His knowledge\nof human nature was so profound that he instinctively touched the right\nkeys, playing on the passions of the common people with a deftness far\nsurpassing in effect the acquired skill of the mere master of oratory.\nHe ordered his arguments and framed their language, so that his readers\nresponded with almost passionate enthusiasm to the call he made upon\nthem. Allied to his gift of intellectual sympathy with his kind was a\nconsummate ability in expression, into which he imparted the fullest\nvalue of the intended meaning. His thought lost nothing in its\nstatement. Writing as he did from the point of view of a tradesman, to\nthe shopkeepers, farmers, and common people of Ireland, his business was\nto speak with them as if he were one of them. He had already laid bare\ntheir grievances caused by the selfish legislation of the English\nParliament, which had ruined Irish manufactures; he had written grimly\nof the iniquitous laws which had destroyed the woollen trade of the\ncountry; he had not forgotten the condition of the people as he saw it\non his journeys from Dublin to Cork--a condition which he was later to\nreveal in the most terrible of his satirical tracts--and he realized\nwith almost personal anguish the degradation of the people brought about\nby the rapacity and selfishness of a class which governed with no\nthought of ultimate consequences, and with no apparent understanding of\nwhat justice implied. It was left for him to precipitate his private\nopinion and public spirit in such form as would arouse the nation to a\nsense of self-respect, if not to a pitch of resentment. The \"Drapier's\nLetters\" was the reagent that accomplished both.\n\nThe editor takes this opportunity to express his thanks and obligations\nto Mr. G.R. Dennis, to Mr. W. Spencer Jackson, to the late Colonel F.R.\nGrant, to Mr. C. Litton Falkiner of Killiney, and to Mr. O'Donoghue of\nDublin. His acknowledgment is here also made to Mr. Strickland, of the\nNational Gallery of Ireland, to whose kindness and learning he is\ngreatly indebted.\n\nTEMPLE SCOTT.\n\nNEW YORK, _March_, 1903.\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\nLETTER I.

It has been indignantly\ndenied by contemporary writers that this small change meant copper\ncoins. They asserted that there was no lack of copper money, but that\nthere was a great want of small silver. Be that as it may, the report\nthat small change was wanting was sufficiently substantiated to the\nEnglish government to warrant it to proceed to satisfy the want. In its\ndealings with Ireland, however, English governments appear to have\nconsistently assumed that attitude which would most likely cause\nfriction and arouse disturbance. In England coins for currency proceeded\nfrom a mint established under government supervision. In Scotland such a\nmint was specially provided for in the Act of Union. But in Ireland, the\ngovernment acted otherwise.\n\nThe Irish people had again and again begged that they should be\npermitted to establish a mint in which coins could be issued of the same\nstandard and intrinsic value as those used in England. English\nparliaments, however, invariably disregarded these petitions. Instead of\nthe mint the King gave grants or patents by which a private individual\nobtained the right to mint coins for the use of the inhabitants. The\nright was most often given for a handsome consideration, and held for a\nterm of years. In 1660 Charles II. granted such a patent to Sir Thomas\nArmstrong, permitting him to coin farthings for twenty years. It\nappears, however, that Armstrong never actually coined the farthings,\nalthough he had gone to the expense of establishing a costly plant for\nthe purpose.\n\nSmall copper coins becoming scarce, several individuals, without\npermission, issued tokens; but the practice was stopped. In 1680 Sir\nWilliam Armstrong, son of Sir Thomas, with Colonel George Legg\n(afterwards Lord Dartmouth), obtained a patent for twenty-one years,\ngranting them the right to issue copper halfpence. Coins were actually\nstruck and circulated, but the patent itself was sold to John Knox in\nthe very year of its issue. Knox, however, had his patent specially\nrenewed, but his coinage was interrupted when James II. issued his\ndebased money during the Revolution (see Monck Mason, p. 334, and the\nnotes on this matter to the Drapier's Third Letter, in present edition).\n\nKnox sold his patent to Colonel Roger Moore, who overstocked the country\nwith his coins to such an extent that the currency became undervalued.\nWhen, in 1705, Moore endeavoured to obtain a renewal of his patent, his\napplication was refused. By 1722, owing either to Moore's bad coinage,\nor to the importation of debased coins from other countries, the copper\nmoney had degraded considerably. In a pamphlet[1] issued by George\nEwing in Dublin (1724), it is stated that in that year, W. Trench\npresented a memorial to the Lords of the Treasury, complaining of the\ncondition of the copper coinage, and pointing out that the evil results\nhad been brought about by the system of grants to private individuals.\nNotwithstanding this memorial, it was attempted to overcome the\ndifficulty by a continuance of the old methods. A new patent was issued\nto an English iron merchant, William Wood by name, who, according to\nCoxe, submitted proposal with many others, for the amelioration of the\ngrievance. Wood's proposals, say this same authority, were accepted \"as\nbeneficial to Ireland.\" The letters patent bear the date July 12th,\n1722, and were prepared in accordance with the King's instructions to\nthe Attorney and Solicitor General sent in a letter from Kensington on\nJune 16th, 1722. The letter commanded \"that a bill should be prepared\nfor his royal signature, containing and importing an indenture, whereof\none part was to pass the Great Seal of Great Britain.\" This indenture,\nnotes Monck Mason,[2] between His Majesty of the one part, \"and William\nWood, of Wolverhampton, in the County of Stafford, Esq.,\" of the other,\nsignifies that His Majesty\n\n\"has received information that, in his kingdom of Ireland, there was a\ngreat want of small money for making small payments, and that retailers\nand others did suffer by reason of such want.\"\n\n[Footnote 1: \"A Defence of the Conduct of the People of Ireland in their\nunanimous refusal of Mr. Wood's Copper Money,\" pp. 22-23.]\n\n[Footnote 2: \"History of St. Patrick's Cathedral,\" note v, pp. 326-327.]\n\nBy virtue, therefore, of his prerogative royal, and in consideration of\nthe rents, covenants, and agreements therein expressed, His Majesty\ngranted to William Wood, his executors, assigns, etc., \"full, free,\nsole, and absolute power, privilege, licence, and authority,\" during\nfourteen years, from the annunciation of the Blessed Virgin, 1722, to\ncoin halfpence and farthings of copper, to be uttered and disposed of in\nIreland, and not elsewhere. It was provided that the whole quantity\ncoined should not exceed 360 tons of copper, whereof 100 tons only were\nto be coined in the first year, and 20 tons in each of the last\nthirteen, said farthings and halfpence to be of good, pure, and\nmerchantable copper, and of such size and bigness, that one avoirdupois\npound weight of copper should not be converted into more farthings and\nhalfpence than would make thirty pence by tale; all the said farthings\nand halfpence to be of equal weight in themselves, or as near thereunto\nas might be, allowing a remedy not exceeding two farthings over or under\nin each pound. The same \"to pass and to be received as current money, by\nsuch as shall or will, voluntarily and willingly, and not otherwise,\nreceive the same, within the said kingdom of Ireland, and not\nelsewhere.\" Wood also covenanted to pay to the King's clerk or\ncomptroller of the coinage, £200 yearly, and £100 per annum into his\nMajesty's treasury.\n\nMost of the accounts of this transaction and its consequent agitation\nin Ireland, particularly those given by Sir W. Scott and Earl Stanhope,\nare taken from Coxe's \"Life of Walpole.\" Monck Mason, however, in his\nvarious notes appended to his life of Swift, has once and for all placed\nCoxe's narrative in its true light, and exposed the specious special\npleading on behalf of his hero, Walpole. But even Coxe cannot hide the\nfact that the granting of the patent and the circumstances under which\nit was granted, amounted to a disgraceful job, by which an opportunity\nwas seized to benefit a \"noble person\" in England at the expense of\nIreland. The patent was really granted to the King's mistress, the\nDuchess of Kendal, who sold it to William Wood for the sum of £10,000,\nand (as it was reported with, probably, much truth) for a share in the\nprofits of the coining. The job was alluded to by Swift when he wrote:\n\n\"When late a feminine magician,\nJoin'd with a brazen politician,\nExpos'd, to blind a nation's eyes,\nA parchment of prodigious size.\"\n\nCoxe endeavors to exonerate Walpole from the disgrace attached to this\nbusiness, by expatiating on Carteret's opposition to Walpole, an\nopposition which went so far as to attempt to injure the financial\nminister's reputation by fomenting jealousies and using the Wood patent\nagitation to arouse against him the popular indignation; but this does\nnot explain away the fact itself. He lays some blame for the agitation\non Wood's indiscretion in flaunting his rights and publicly boasting of\nwhat the great minister would do for him. At the same time he takes care\nto censure the government for its misconduct in not consulting with the\nLord Lieutenant and his Privy Council before granting the patent. His\ncensure, however, is founded on the consideration that this want of\nattention was injudicious and was the cause of the spread of exaggerated\nrumours of the patent's evil tendency. He has nothing to say of the\nrights and liberties of a people which had thereby been infringed and\nignored.\n\nThe English parliament had rarely shown much consideration for Irish\nfeelings or Irish rights. Its attitude towards the Irish Houses of\nLegislation had been high-handed and even dictatorial; so that\nconstitutional struggles were not at all infrequent towards the end of\nthe seventeenth and during the first quarter of the eighteenth century.\nThe efforts of Sir Constantine Phipps towards a non-parliamentary\ngovernment,[3] and the reversal by the English House of Lords of the\ndecision given by the Irish House of Lords in the famous Annesley case,\nhad prepared the Irish people for a revolt against any further attempts\nto dictate to its properly elected representatives assembled in\nparliament. Moreover, the wretched material condition of the people, as\nit largely had been brought about by a selfish, persecuting legislation\nthat practically isolated Ireland commercially in prohibiting the\nexportation of its industrial products, was a danger and a menace to the\ngoverning country. The two nations were facing each other threateningly.\nWhen, therefore, Wood began to import his coin, suspicion was\nimmediately aroused.\n\n[Footnote 3: See Lecky's \"History of Ireland,\" vol. i., p. 446, etc.]\n\nThe masses took little notice of it at first; but the commissioners of\nrevenue in Dublin took action in a letter they addressed to the Right\nHon. Edward Hopkins, secretary to the Lord Lieutenant. This letter,\ndated August 7th, 1722, began by expressing surprise at the patent\ngranted to Mr. Wood, and asked the secretary \"to lay before the Lord\nLieutenant a memorial, presented by their agent to the Lords of the\nTreasury, concerning this patent, and also a report of some former\nCommissioners of the revenue on the like occasion, and to acquaint his\nGrace, that they concurred in all the objections in those papers, and\nwere of opinion, that such a patent would be highly prejudicial to the\ntrade, and welfare of this kingdom, and more particularly to his\nMajesty's revenue, which they had formerly found to have suffered very\nmuch, by too great a quantity of such base coin.\"[4] No reply was\nreceived to this letter.\n\n[Footnote 4: \"A Defence of the Conduct of the People of Ireland,\" etc.,\np. 6.]\n\nFears began to be generally felt, and the early murmurs of an agitation\nto be heard when, on September 19th, 1722, the Commissioners addressed a\nsecond letter, this time to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's\nTreasury. The letter assured their Lordships \"that they had been applied\nto by many persons of rank and fortune, and by the merchants and traders\nin Ireland, to represent the ill effects of Mr. Wood's patent, and that\nthey could from former experience assure their Lordships, it would be\nparticularly detrimental to his Majesty's revenue. They represented that\nthis matter had made a great noise here, and that there did not appear\nthe _least want of such small species of coin for change_, and hoped\nthat the importance of the occasion would excuse their making this\nrepresentation of a matter that had not been referred to them.\"[5]\n\n[Footnote 5: _Ibid_, pp. 6-7.]\n\nTo this letter also no reply was vouchsafed. In the meantime, Wood kept\nsending in his coins, landing them at most of the ports of the kingdom.\n\n\"Then everyone that was not interested in the success of this coinage,\"\nwrites the author of the pamphlet already quoted, \"by having contracted\nfor a great quantity of his halfpence at a large discount, or biassed by\nthe hopes of immoderate gain to be made out of the ruins of their\ncountry, expressed their apprehensions of the pernicious consequences of\nthis copper money; and resolved to make use of the _right they had by\nlaw to refuse the same_\".[6]\n\n[Footnote 6: _Ibid_, p. 7.]\n\nThe Lord Lieutenant, the Duke of Grafton, had arrived in August, 1723,\nand parliament sat early in September. Its first attention was paid to\nthe Wood patent. After the early excitement had subsided, they resolved\nto appeal to the King. During the early stages of the discussion,\nhowever, the Commons addressed the Lord Lieutenant, asking that a copy\nof the patent and other papers relating to it, be laid before them. This\nwas on September 13th. On the following day Mr. Hopkins informed the\nHouse that the Lord Lieutenant had no such copy, nor any papers. The\nHouse then unanimously resolved to inquire into the matter on its own\naccount, and issued orders for several persons to appear before it to\ngive evidence, fixing the day for examination for September 16th. On\nthat day, however, Mr. Hopkins appeared before the members with a copy\nof the patent, and informed them that the Lord Lieutenant had received\nit since his last communication with them. This incident served but to\narouse further ridicule. A broadside, published at the time with the\ntitle \"A Creed of an Irish Commoner,\" amusingly reveals the lameness of\nthe excuse for this non-production of the exemplification. Coxe says\nthat the cause for the delay was due to the fact that the copy of the\npatent had been delivered to the Lord Lieutenant's servant, instead of\nto his private secretary; but this excuse is probably no more happily\nfounded than the one offered.\n\nOn Friday, September 20th, the House resolved itself into a committee\n\"to take into consideration the state of the nation, particularly in\nrelation to the importing and uttering of copper halfpence and farthings\nin this kingdom.\" After three days' debate, and after examining\ncompetent witnesses under oath, it passed resolutions to the following\neffect\n\n(1) That Wood's patent is highly prejudicial to his Majesty's revenue,\nand is destructive of trade and commerce, and most dangerous to the\nrights and properties of the subject.\n\n(2) That for the purpose of obtaining the patent Wood had notoriously\nmisrepresented the state of the nation.\n\n(3) That great quantities of the coin had been imported of different\nimpressions and of much less weight than the patent called for.\n\n(4) That the loss to the nation by the uttering of this coin would\namount to 150 per cent.\n\n(5) That in coining the halfpence Wood was guilty of a notorious fraud.\n\n(6) \"That it is the opinion of this Committee, that it hath been always\nhighly prejudicial to this kingdom to grant the power or privilege of\ncoining money to private persons; and that it will, at all times, be of\ndangerous consequence to grant any such power to any body politic, or\ncorporate, or any private person or persons whatsoever.\"[7]\n\n[Footnote 7: \"Comm. Journals,\" vol. iii., pp. 317-325.]\n\nAddresses to his Majesty in conformity with these resolutions were voted\non September 27th.\n\nThe House of Lords passed similar resolutions on September 26th, and\nvoted addresses embodying them on September 28th.[8]\n\n[Footnote 8: \"Lords' Journals,\" vol. ii., pp. 745-751.]\n\nThese Addresses received a better attention than did the letters from\nthe revenue commissioners. The Houses were courteously informed that\ntheir communications would receive His Majesty's careful consideration.\nWalpole kept his promise, but not before he had fought hard to maintain\nthe English prerogative, as he might have called it. The \"secret\"\nhistory as narrated in Coxe's lively manner, throws some light on the\nsituation. Coxe really finds his hero's conduct not marked with \"his\nusual caution.\" The Lord Lieutenant was permitted to go to Ireland\nwithout proper instructions; the information on which Walpole acted was\nnot reliable; and he did not sufficiently appreciate the influence of\nChancellor Midleton and his family. \"He bitterly accused Lord Midleton\nof treachery and low cunning, of having made, in his speeches,\ndistinction between the King and his ministers, of caballing with\nCarteret, Cadogan, and Roxburgh, and of pursuing that line of conduct,\nbecause he was of opinion the opposite party would gain the ascendency\nin the cabinet. He did not believe the disturbances to be so serious as\nthey were represented, nor was he satisfied with the Duke of Grafton's\nconduct, as being solely directed by Conolly, but declared that the part\nacted by Conolly, almost excused what the Brodricks had done.\" Carteret\ncomplained to the King and proved to him that Walpole's policy was a\ndangerous one. The King became irritated and Walpole \"ashamed.\" He even\nbecame \"uneasy,\" and it is to be supposed, took a more \"cautious\"\ncourse; for he managed to conciliate the Brodricks and the powers in\nDublin. But the devil was not ill long. The cabinet crisis resulted in\nthe triumph of Townshend and Walpole, and the devil got well again.\nCarteret must be removed and the patent promoted. But Midleton and the\nBrodricks must be kept friendly. So Carteret went to Ireland as Lord\nLieutenant, Midleton remained Chancellor, and constituted a lord\njustice, and St. John Brodrick was nominated a member of the Privy\nCouncil. Still farther on his \"cautious\" way, Ireland must be given some\nconsideration; hence the Committee of the Privy Council, specially\ncalled to inquire into the grievances complained of by the Irish Houses\nof Parliament in their loyal addresses.\n\nThe Committee sat for several weeks, and the report it issued forms the\nsubject of Swift's animadversions in the Drapier's third letter. But the\ntime spent by the Committee in London was being utilized in quite a\ndifferent fashion by Swift in Ireland. \"Cautious\" as was Walpole, he had\nnot reckoned with the champion of his political opponents of Queen\nAnne's days. Swift had little humour for court intrigues and cabinet\ncabals. He came out into the open to fight the good fight of the people\nto whom courts and cabinets should be servants and not self-seeking\nmasters. Whatever doubts the people of Ireland may have had about the\nlegal validity of their resentment towards Wood and his coins, were\nquickly dissipated when they read \"A Letter to the Shop Keepers,\nTradesmen, Farmers, and Common People of Ireland, concerning the Brass\nHalf-pence coined by Mr. Wood,\" and signed, \"M.B. Drapier.\" The letter,\nas Lord Orrery remarked, acted like the sound of a trumpet. At that\nsound \"a spirit arose among the people, that in the eastern phrase, was\n_like unto a trumpet in the day of the whirlwind_. Every person of every\nrank, party, and denomination was convinced, that the admission of\nWood's copper must prove fatal to the Commonwealth. The papist, the\nfanatic, the Tory, the Whig, all listed themselves volunteers under the\nbanners of M.B. Drapier, and were all equally zealous to serve the\nCommon cause.\"\n\nThe present text of the first of the Drapier's letters is based on that\ngiven by Sir W. Scott, carefully collated with two copies of the first\nedition which differed from each other in many particulars. One belonged\nto the late Colonel F. Grant, and the other is in the British Museum. It\nhas also been read with the collection of the Drapier's Letters issued\nby the Drapier Club in 1725, with the title, \"Fraud Detected\"; with the\nLondon edition of \"The Hibernian Patriot\" (1730), and with Faulkner's\ntext issued in his collected edition of Swift's Works in 1735.\n\n[T.S.]\n\n[Illustration:\n                  A\n\n                TO THE\n_Shop-Keepers_, _Tradesmen_, _Farmers_\n  and _Common-People_ of\n\n              Coined by\n\n                 WITH\nA _Design_ to have them _Pass_ in this\n\n                 TO\n     Mr. _Harding_ the Printer,\n         Upon Occasion of a\n\n\n\n           of _Aug_. 1st.\n\nRelating to Mr. _Wood's_ Half-pence.\n\n       _By_ M.B. _Drapier_.\n    AUTHOR of the LETTER to the\n         SHOP-KEEPERS, &c.\n\n  DUBLIN: Printed by _J.

HARDING THE PRINTER.\n\n\nSir, In your Newsletter of the 1st. instant there is a paragraph dated\nfrom London, July 25th. relating to Wood's halfpence; whereby it is\nplain what I foretold in my \"Letter to the Shopkeepers, &c.\" that this\nvile fellow would never be at rest, and that the danger of our ruin\napproaches nearer, and therefore the kingdom requires NEW and FRESH\nWARNING; however I take that paragraph to be, in a great measure, an\nimposition upon the public, at least I hope so, because I am informed\nthat Wood is generally his own newswriter. I cannot but observe from\nthat paragraph that this public enemy of ours, not satisfied to ruin us\nwith his trash, takes every occasion to treat this kingdom with the\nutmost contempt. He represents \"several of our merchants and traders\nupon examination before a committee of council, agreeing that there was\nthe utmost necessity of copper money here, before his patent, so that\nseveral gentlemen have been forced to tally with their workmen and give\nthem bits of cards sealed and subscribed with their names.\" What then?\nIf a physician prescribes to a patient a dram of physic, shall a rascal\napothecary cram him with a pound, and mix it up with poison? And is not\na landlord's hand and seal to his own labourers a better security for\nfive or ten shillings, than Wood's brass seven times below the real\nvalue, can be to the kingdom, for an hundred and four thousand\npounds?[3]\n\n[Footnote 3: Thus in original edition. £108,000 is the amount generally\ngiven. See note on p. 15. [T.S.]]\n\nBut who are these merchants and traders of Ireland that make this report\nof \"the utmost necessity we are under of copper money\"? They are only a\nfew betrayers of their country, confederates with Wood, from whom they\nare to purchase a great quantity of his coin, perhaps at half value, and\nvend it among us to the ruin of the public, and their own private\nadvantage. Are not these excellent witnesses, upon whose integrity the\nfate of a kingdom must depend, who are evidences in their own cause, and\nsharers in this work of iniquity?\n\nIf we could have deserved the liberty of coining for ourselves, as we\nformerly did, and why we have not _is everybody's wonder as well as\nmine_,[4] ten thousand pounds might have been coined here in Dublin of\nonly one-fifth below the intrinsic value, and this sum, with the stock\nof halfpence we then had, would have been sufficient:[5] But Wood by his\nemissaries, enemies to God and this kingdom, hath taken care to buy up\nas many of our old halfpence as he could, and from thence the present\nwant of change arises; to remove which, by Mr. Wood's remedy, would be,\nto cure a scratch on the finger by cutting off the arm. But supposing\nthere were not one farthing of change in the whole nation, I will\nmaintain, that five and twenty thousand pounds would be a sum fully\nsufficient to answer all our occasions. I am no inconsiderable\nshopkeeper in this town, I have discoursed with several of my own and\nother trades, with many gentlemen both of city and country, and also\nwith great numbers of farmers, cottagers, and labourers, who all agree\nthat two shillings in change for every family would be more than\nnecessary in all dealings. Now by the largest computation (even before\nthat grievous discouragement of agriculture, which hath so much lessened\nour numbers [6]) the souls in this kingdom are computed to be one\nmillion and a half, which, allowing but six to a family, makes two\nhundred and fifty thousand families, and consequently two shillings to\neach family will amount only to five and twenty thousand pounds, whereas\nthis honest liberal hardwareman Wood would impose upon us above four\ntimes that sum.\n\n[Footnote 4: Time and again Ireland had petitioned the King of England\nfor the establishment of a mint in Dublin. Both Houses of Parliament\naddressed King Charles I. in 1634, begging for a mint which should coin\nmoney in Ireland of the same standard and values as those of England,\nand allowing the profits to the government. Wentworth supported the\naddress; but it was refused (Carte's \"Ormond,\" vol. i., pp. 79-80). When\nLord Cornwallis's petition for a renewal of his patent for minting coins\nwas presented in 1700, it was referred to a committee of the Lords\nJustices. In their report the Lords Justices condemned the system in\nvogue, and urged the establishment of a mint, in which the coining of\nmoney should be in the hands of the government and in those of a\nsubject. No notice was taken of this advice. See Lecky's \"Ireland,\" vol.\ni., p. 448 (ed 1892) [T.S.]]\n\n[Footnote 5: Boulter stated that £10,000 or £15,000 would have amply\nfulfilled the demand (\"Letters,\" vol. i., pp. 4, 11). [T.S.]]\n\n[Footnote 6: It was not alone the direct discouragement of agriculture\nwhich lessened the population. This result was also largely brought\nabout by the anti-Catholic legislation of Queen Anne's reign, which\n\"reduced the Roman Catholics to a state of depression,\" and caused\nthousands of them to go elsewhere for the means of living. See\nCrawford's \"Ireland,\" vol. ii., pp. 264-267. [T.S.]]\n\nYour paragraph relates further, that Sir Isaac Newton reported an assay\ntaken at the Tower of Wood's metal, by which it appears, that Wood had\nin all respects performed his contract[7]. His contract! With whom? Was\nit with the parliament or people of Ireland? Are not they to be the\npurchasers? But they detest, abhor, and reject it, as corrupt,\nfraudulent, mingled with dirt and trash. Upon which he grows angry, goes\nto law, and will impose his goods upon us by force.\n\n[Footnote 7: For the full text of Newton's report see Appendix, No. II.\n[T.S.]]\n\nBut your Newsletter says that an assay was made of the coin. How\nimpudent and insupportable is this? Wood takes care to coin a dozen or\ntwo halfpence of good metal, sends them to the Tower and they are\napproved, and these must answer all that he hath already coined or shall\ncoin for the future. It is true indeed, that a gentleman often sends to\nmy shop for a pattern of stuff, I cut it fairly off, and if he likes it,\nhe comes or sends and compares the pattern with the whole piece, and\nprobably we come to a bargain. But if I were to buy an hundred sheep,\nand the grazier should bring me one single wether fat and well fleeced\nby way of pattern, and expect the same price round for the whole\nhundred, without suffering me to see them before he was paid, or giving\nme good security to restore my money for those that were lean or shorn\nor scabby, I would be none of his customer. I have heard of a man who\nhad a mind to sell his house, and therefore carried a piece of brick in\nhis pocket, which he shewed as a pattern to encourage purchasers: And\nthis is directly the case in point with Mr. Wood's assay.[8]\n\n[Footnote 8: Monck Mason remarks on this assay that \"the assay-masters\ndo not report that Mr. Wood's coinage was superior to that of former\nkings, but only to those specimens of such coinages as were exhibited by\nMr. Wood, which, it is admitted were much worn. Whether the money coined\nin the preceding reign was good or bad is in fact nothing to the\npurpose.\" \"'What argument,'\" quotes Monck Mason from the tract issued in\n1724 entitled, \"A Defence of the Conduct of the People of Ireland, in\ntheir unanimous refusal of Mr. Wood's Copper Money,\" \"'can be drawn from\nthe badness of our former coinages but this, that because we have\nformerly been cheated by our coiners, we ought to suffer Mr. Wood to\ncheat us over again? Whereas, one reason for our so vigorously opposing\nMr. Wood's coinage, is, because we have always been imposed upon in our\ncopper money, and we find he is treading exactly in the steps of his\npredecessors, and thinks he has a right to cheat us because he can shew\na precedent for it.' In truth, there was a vast number of counterfeits\nof those coins, which had been imported, chiefly from Scotland, as\nappears from a proclamation prohibiting the Importation of them in 1697\"\n(\"History St. Patrick's Cathedral,\" p, 340, note d.) [T.S.]]\n\nThe next part of the paragraph contains Mr. Wood's voluntary proposals\nfor \"preventing any future objections or apprehensions.\"\n\nHis first proposal is, that \"whereas he hath already coined seventeen\nthousand pounds, and has copper prepared to make it up forty thousand\npounds, he will be content to coin no more, unless the EXIGENCES OF\nTRADE REQUIRE IT, though his patent empowers him to coin a far greater\nquantity.\"\n\nTo which if I were to answer it should be thus: \"Let Mr. Wood and his\ncrew of founders and tinkers coin on till there is not an old kettle\nleft in the kingdom: let them coin old leather, tobacco-pipe clay or the\ndirt in the streets, and call their trumpery by what name they please\nfrom a guinea to a farthing, we are not under any concern to know how he\nand his tribe or accomplices think fit to employ themselves.\" But I hope\nand trust, that we are all to a man fully determined to have nothing to\ndo with him or his ware.\n\nThe King has given him a patent to coin halfpence, but hath not obliged\nus to take them, and I have already shewn in my \"Letter to the\nShopkeepers, &c.\" that the law hath not left it in the power of the\nprerogative to compel the subject to take any money, beside gold and\nsilver of the right sterling and standard.\n\nWood further proposes, (if I understand him right, for his expressions\nare dubious) that \"he will not coin above forty thousand pounds, unless\nthe exigences of trade require it.\" First, I observe that this sum of\nforty thousand pounds is almost double to what I proved to be sufficient\nfor the whole kingdom, although we had not one of our old halfpence\nleft. Again I ask, who is to be judge when the exigences of trade\nrequire it? Without doubt he means himself, for as to us of this poor\nkingdom, who must be utterly ruined if his project should succeed, we\nwere never once consulted till the matter was over, and he will judge of\nour exigences by his own; neither will these be ever at an end till he\nand his accomplices will think they have enough: And it now appears that\nhe will not be content with all our gold and silver, but intends to buy\nup our goods and manufactures with the same coin.\n\nI shall not enter into examination of the prices for which he now\nproposes to sell his halfpence, or what he calls his copper, by the\npound; I have said enough of it in my former letter, and it hath\nlikewise been considered by others. It is certain that by his own first\ncomputation, we were to pay three shillings for what was intrinsically\nworth but one,[9] although it had been of the true weight and standard\nfor which he pretended to have contracted; but there is so great a\ndifference both in weight and badness in several of his coins that some\nof them have been nine in ten below the intrinsic value, and most of\nthem six or seven.[10]\n\n[Footnote 9: The report of the Committee of the Privy Council which sat\non Wood's coinage, stated that copper ready for minting cost eighteen\npence per pound before it was brought into the Mint at the Tower of\nLondon. See the Report prefixed to Letter III. and Appendix II., in\nwhich it is also stated that Wood's copper was worth thirteen pence per\npound. [T.S.]]\n\n[Footnote 10: Newton's assay report says that Wood's pieces were of\nunequal weight. [T.S.]]\n\nHis last proposal being of a peculiar strain and nature, deserves to be\nvery particularly considered, both on account of the matter and the\nstyle. It is as follows.\n\n\"Lastly, in consideration of the direful apprehensions which prevail in\nIreland, that Mr. Wood will by such coinage drain them of their gold and\nsilver, he proposes to take their manufactures in exchange, and that no\nperson be obliged to receive more than fivepence halfpenny at one\npayment.\"\n\nFirst, Observe this little impudent hardwareman turning into ridicule\n\"the direful apprehensions of a whole kingdom,\" priding himself as the\ncause of them, and daring to prescribe what no King of England ever\nattempted, how far a whole nation shall be obliged to take his brass\ncoin. And he has reason to insult; for sure there was never an example\nin history, of a great kingdom kept in awe for above a year in daily\ndread of utter destruction, not by a powerful invader at the head of\ntwenty thousand men, not by a plague or a famine, not by a tyrannical\nprince (for we never had one more gracious) or a corrupt administration,\nbut by one single, diminutive, insignificant, mechanic.\n\nBut to go on. To remove our \"direful apprehensions that he will drain us\nof our gold and silver by his coinage:\" This little arbitrary\nmock-monarch most graciously offers to \"take our manufactures in\nexchange.\" Are our Irish understandings indeed so low in his opinion? Is\nnot this the very misery we complain of? That his cursed project will\nput us under the necessity of selling our goods for what is equal to\nnothing. How would such a proposal sound from France or Spain or any\nother country we deal with, if they should offer to deal with us only\nupon this condition, that we should take their money at ten times higher\nthan the intrinsic value? Does Mr. Wood think, for instance, that we\nwill sell him a stone of wool for a parcel of his counters not worth\nsixpence, when we can send it to England and receive as many shillings\nin gold and silver? Surely there was never heard such a compound of\nimpudence, villainy and folly.\n\nHis proposals conclude with perfect high treason. He promises, that no\nperson shall be _obliged_ to receive more than fivepence halfpenny of\nhis coin in one payment: By which it is plain, that he pretends to\n_oblige_ every subject in this kingdom to take so much in every payment,\nif it be offered; whereas his patent obliges no man, nor can the\nprerogative by law claim such a power, as I have often observed; so\nthat here Mr. Wood takes upon him the entire legislature, and an\nabsolute dominion over the properties of the whole nation.\n\nGood God! Who are this wretch's advisers? Who are his supporters,\nabettors, encouragers, or sharers? Mr. Wood will _oblige_ me to take\nfivepence halfpenny of his brass in every payment! And I will shoot Mr.\nWood and his deputies through the head, like highwaymen or\nhousebreakers, if they dare to force one farthing of their coin upon me\nin the payment of an hundred pounds. It is no loss of honour to submit\nto the lion, but who, with the figure of a man, can think with patience\nof being devoured alive by a rat. He has laid a tax upon the people of\nIreland of seventeen shillings at least in the pound; a tax I say, not\nonly upon lands, but interest-money, goods, manufactures, the hire of\nhandicraftsmen, labourers, and servants. Shopkeepers look to yourselves.\nWood will _oblige_ and force you to take fivepence halfpenny of his\ntrash in every payment, and many of you receive twenty, thirty, forty\npayments in a day, or else you can hardly find bread: And pray consider\nhow much that will amount to in a year: Twenty times fivepence halfpenny\nis nine shillings and twopence, which is above an hundred and sixty\npounds a year, whereof you will be losers of at least one hundred and\nforty pounds by taking your payments in his money. If any of you be\ncontent to deal with Mr. Wood on such conditions they may. But for my\nown particular, \"let his money perish with him.\" If the famous Mr.\nHampden rather chose to go to prison, than pay a few shillings to King\nCharles 1st. without authority of Parliament, I will rather choose to be\nhanged than have all my substance taxed at seventeen shillings in the\npound, at the arbitrary will and pleasure of the venerable Mr. Wood.\n\nThe paragraph concludes thus. \"N.B.\" (that is to say _nota bene_, or\n_mark well_), \"No evidence appeared from Ireland, or elsewhere, to prove\nthe mischiefs complained of, or any abuses whatsoever committed in the\nexecution of the said grant.\"\n\nThe impudence of this remark exceeds all that went before. First; the\nHouse of Commons in Ireland, which represents the whole people of the\nkingdom; and secondly the Privy-council, addressed His Majesty against\nthese halfpence. What could be done more to express the universal sense\nand opinion of the nation? If his copper were diamonds, and the kingdom\nwere entirely against it, would not that be sufficient to reject it?\nMust a committee of the House of Commons, and our whole Privy-council go\nover to argue _pro_ and _con_ with Mr. Wood? To what end did the King\ngive his patent for coining of halfpence in Ireland? Was it not, because\nit was represented to his sacred Majesty, that such a coinage would be\nof advantage to the good of this kingdom, and of all his subjects here?\nIt is to the patentee's peril if his representation be false, and the\nexecution of his patent be fraudulent and corrupt. Is he so wicked and\nfoolish to think that his patent was given him to ruin a million and a\nhalf of people, that he might be a gainer of three or four score\nthousand pounds to himself? Before he was at the charge of passing a\npatent, much more of raking up so much filthy dross, and stamping it\nwith His Majesty's \"image and superscription,\" should he not first in\ncommon sense, in common equity, and common manners, have consulted the\nprincipal party concerned; that is to say, the people of the kingdom,\nthe House of Lords or Commons, or the Privy-council? If any foreigner\nshould ask us, \"whose image and superscription\" there is in Wood's coin,\nwe should be ashamed to tell him, it was Caesar's. In that great want of\ncopper halfpence, which he alleges we were, our city set up our Caesar's\nstatue[11] in excellent copper, at an expense that is equal in value to\nthirty thousand pounds of his coin: And we will not receive his _image_\nin worse metal.\n\n[Footnote 11: An equestrian statue of George I. at Essex Bridge, Dublin,\n[F.]]\n\nI observe many of our people putting a melancholy case on this subject.\n\"It is true\" say they, \"we are all undone if Wood's halfpence must pass;\nbut what shall we do, if His Majesty puts out a proclamation commanding\nus to take them?\" This hath been often dinned in my ears. But I desire\nmy countrymen to be assured that there is nothing in it. The King never\nissues out a proclamation but to enjoin what the law permits him. He\nwill not issue out a proclamation against law, or if such a thing\nshould happen by a mistake, we are no more obliged to obey it than to\nrun our heads into the fire. Besides, His Majesty will never command us\nby a proclamation, what he does not offer to command us in the patent\nitself. There he leaves it to our discretion, so that our destruction\nmust be entirely owing to ourselves. Therefore let no man be afraid of a\nproclamation, which will never be granted; and if it should, yet upon\nthis occasion, will be of no force. The King's revenues here are near\nfour hundred thousand pounds a year, can you think his ministers will\nadvise him to take them in Wood's brass, which will reduce the value to\nfifty thousand pounds. England gets a million sterl. by this nation,\nwhich, if this project goes on, will be almost reduced to nothing: And\ndo you think those who live in England upon Irish estates will be\ncontent to take an eighth or a tenth part, by being paid in Wood's\ndross?\n\nIf Wood and his confederates were not convinced of our stupidity, they\nnever would have attempted so audacious an enterprise. He now sees a\nspirit hath been raised against him, and he only watches till it begins\nto flag, he goes about \"watching\" when to \"devour us.\" He hopes we shall\nbe weary of contending with him, and at last out of ignorance, or fear,\nor of being perfectly tired with opposition, we shall be forced to\nyield. And therefore I confess it is my chief endeavour to keep up your\nspirits and resentments. If I tell you there is a precipice under you,\nand that if you go forwards you will certainly break your necks. If I\npoint to it before your eyes, must I be at the trouble of repeating it\nevery morning? Are our people's \"hearts waxed gross\"? Are \"their ears\ndull of hearing,\" and have \"they closed their eyes\"? I fear there are\nsome few vipers among us, who, for ten or twenty pounds gain, would sell\ntheir souls and their country, though at last it would end in their own\nruin as well as ours. Be not like \"the deaf adder, who refuses to hear\nthe voice of the charmer, charm he never so wisely.\"\n\nThough my letter be directed to you, Mr. Harding, yet I intend it for\nall my countrymen. I have no interest in this affair but what is common\nto the public. I can live better than many others, I have some gold and\nsilver by me, and a shop well furnished, and shall be able to make a\nshift when many of my betters are starving. But I am grieved to see the\ncoldness and indifference of many people, with whom I discourse. Some\nare afraid of a proclamation, others shrug up their shoulders, and cry,\n\"What would you have us do?\" Some give out, there is no danger at all.\nOthers are comforted that it will be a common calamity and they shall\nfare no worse than their neighbours. Will a man, who hears midnight\nrobbers at his door, get out of bed, and raise his family for a common\ndefence, and shall a whole kingdom lie in a lethargy, while Mr. Wood\ncomes at the head of his confederates to rob them of all they have, to\nruin us and our posterity for ever? If an highwayman meets you on the\nroad, you give him your money to save your life, but, God be thanked,\nMr. Wood cannot touch a hair of your heads. You have all the laws of God\nand man on your side. When he or his accomplices offer you his dross it\nis but saying no, and you are safe. If a madman should come to my shop\nwith an handful of dirt raked out of the kennel, and offer it in payment\nfor ten yards of stuff, I would pity or laugh at him, or, if his\nbehaviour deserved it, kick him out of my doors. And if Mr. Wood comes\nto demand any gold and silver, or commodities for which I have paid my\ngold and silver, in exchange for his trash, can he deserve or expect\nbetter treatment?\n\nWhen the evil day is come (if it must come) let us mark and observe\nthose who presume to offer these halfpence in payment. Let their names,\nand trades, and places of abode be made public, that every one may be\naware of them, as betrayers of their country, and confederates with Mr.\nWood. Let them be watched at markets and fairs, and let the first honest\ndiscoverer give the word about, that Wood's halfpence have been offered,\nand caution the poor innocent people not to receive them.\n\nPerhaps I have been too tedious; but there would never be an end, if I\nattempted to say all that this melancholy subject will bear. I will\nconclude with humbly offering one proposal, which, if it were put in\npractice, would blow up this destructive project at once. Let some\nskilful judicious pen draw up an advertisement to the following purpose.\n\nThat \"Whereas one William Wood hardware-man, now or lately sojourning\nin the city of London, hath, by many misrepresentations, procured a\npatent for coining an hundred and forty thousand pounds[12] in copper\nhalfpence for this kingdom, which is a sum five times greater than our\noccasions require. And whereas it is notorious that the said Wood hath\ncoined his halfpence of such base metal and false weight, that they are,\nat least, six parts in seven below the real value. And whereas we have\nreason to apprehend, that the said Wood may, at any time hereafter,\nclandestinely coin as many more halfpence as he pleases. And whereas the\nsaid patent neither doth nor can _oblige_ His Majesty's subjects to\nreceive the said halfpence in any payment, but leaves it to their\nvoluntary choice, because, by law the subject cannot be _obliged_ to\ntake any money except gold or silver. And whereas, contrary to the\nletter and meaning of the said patent, the said Wood hath declared that\nevery person shall be _obliged_ to take fivepence halfpenny of his coin\nin every payment. And whereas the House of Commons and Privy-council\nhave severally addressed his Most Sacred Majesty, representing the ill\nconsequences which the said coinage may have upon this kingdom. And\nlastly whereas it is universally agreed, that the whole nation to a man\n(except Mr. Wood and his confederates) are in the utmost apprehensions\nof the ruinous consequences, that must follow from the said coinage.\nTherefore we whose names are underwritten, being persons of considerable\nestates in this kingdom, and residers therein, do unanimously resolve\nand declare that we will never receive, one farthing or halfpenny of the\nsaid Wood's coining, and that we will direct all our tenants to refuse\nthe said coin from any person whatsoever; Of which that they may not be\nignorant, we have sent them a copy of this advertisement, to be read to\nthem by our stewards, receivers, &c.\"\n\n[Footnote 12: In the first paragraph of this letter the sum was given as\n£104,000. [T.S.]]\n\nI could wish, that a paper of this nature might be drawn up, and signed\nby two or three hundred principal gentlemen of this kingdom, and printed\ncopies thereof sent to their several tenants; I am deceived, if anything\ncould sooner defeat this execrable design of Wood and his accomplices.\nThis would immediately give the alarm, and set the kingdom on their\nguard. This would give courage to the meanest tenant and cottager. \"How\nlong, O Lord, righteous and true.\"\n\nI must tell you in particular, Mr. Harding, that you are much to blame.\nSeveral hundred persons have enquired at your house for my \"Letter to\nthe Shopkeepers, &c.\" and you had none to sell them. Pray keep yourself\nprovided with that letter, and with this; you have got very well by the\nformer, but I did not then write for your sake, any more than I do now.\nPray advertise both in every newspaper, and let it not be _your_ fault\nor _mine_, if our countrymen will not take warning. I desire you\nlikewise to sell them as cheap as you can.\n\n_I am your servant_,\n\nM.B.\n\n_Aug._ 4, 1724.\n\n\n\n\n_The Report of the Committee of the Lords of His\nMajesty's most honourable Privy-Council, in\nrelation to Mr. Wood's Halfpence\nand Farthings, etc._[1]\n\nAT THE COUNCIL CHAMBER AT WHITEHALL, THE 24TH DAY\nOF JULY, 1724.\n\n\nIn obedience to your Majesty's order of reference, upon the several\nresolutions and addresses of both Houses of Parliament of Ireland,\nduring their late session, the late address of your Majesty's justices,\nand Privy-council of that kingdom, and the petitions of the county and\ncity of Dublin, concerning a patent granted by your Majesty to William\nWood Esq; for the coining and uttering copper halfpence and farthings in\nthe kingdom of Ireland, to such persons as would voluntarily accept the\nsame; and upon the petition of the said William Wood, concerning the\nsame coinage, the Lords of the Committee have taken into their\nconsideration the said patent, addresses, petitions, and all matters and\npapers relating thereto, and have heard and examined all such persons,\nas upon due and sufficient notice, were desirous and willing to be heard\nupon the subject matter under their consideration, and have agreed upon\nthe following Report, containing a true state of the whole matter, as it\nappeared before them, with their humble opinion, to be laid before your\nMajesty for your royal consideration and determination, upon a matter of\nsuch importance.\n\n[Footnote 1: For the story of the origin of this report see the Note\nprefixed to Letter III. [T.S.]]\n\nThe several addresses to your Majesty from your subjects of Ireland,\ncontain in general terms the strongest representations of the great\napprehensions they were under, from the importing and uttering copper\nhalfpence and farthings in Ireland, by virtue of the patent granted to\nMr. Wood, which they conceived would prove highly prejudicial to your\nMajesty's revenue, destructive of the trade and commerce of the kingdom,\nand of dangerous consequence to the properties of the subject. They\nrepresent, That the patent had been obtained in a clandestine and\nunprecedented manner, and by notorious misrepresentations of the state\nof Ireland; That if the terms of the patent had been complied with, this\ncoinage would have been of infinite loss to the kingdom, but that the\npatentee, under colour of the powers granted to him, had imported and\nendeavoured to utter great quantities of different impressions, and of\nless weight, than required by the patent, and had been guilty of\nnotorious frauds and deceit in coining the said copper money: And they\nhumbly beseech your Majesty, that you would give such directions, as in\nyour great wisdom you should think proper, to prevent the fatal effects\nof uttering any half pence or farthings by virtue of the said patent:\nAnd the House of Commons of Ireland, in a second address upon this\nsubject, pray, That your Majesty would be pleased to give directions to\nthe several officers intrusted in the receipt of your Majesty's revenue,\nThat they do not on any pretence whatever, receive or utter any of the\nsaid copper halfpence or farthings.\n\nIn answer to the addresses of the Houses of Parliament of Ireland, your\nMajesty was most graciously pleased to assure them, \"That if any abuses\nhad been committed by the patentee, you would give the necessary orders\nfor enquiring into and punishing those abuses; and that your Majesty\nwould do everything, that was in your power, for the satisfaction of\nyour people.\"\n\nIn pursuance of this your Majesty's most gracious declaration, your\nMajesty was pleased to take this matter into you royal consideration;\nand that you might be the better enabled effectually to answer the\nexpectations of your people of Ireland, your Majesty was pleased by a\nletter from Lord Carteret, one of your principal secretaries of state,\ndated March 10, 1723-4, to signify your pleasure to your Lord Lieutenant\nof Ireland, \"That he should give directions for sending over such papers\nand witnesses as should be thought proper to support the objections made\nagainst the patent, and against the patentee, in the execution of the\npowers given him by the patent.\"\n\nUpon the receipt of these your Majesty's orders, the Lord Lieutenant, by\nhis letter of the 20th of March, 1723-4, represented the great\ndifficulty he found himself under, to comply with these your Majesty's\norders; and by another letter of the 24th of March 1723-4, \"after\nconsulting the principal members of both Houses, who were immediately in\nyour Majesty's service, and of the Privy Council,\" acquainted your\nMajesty, \"That none of them would take upon them to advise, how any\nmaterial persons or papers might be sent over on this occasion; but they\nall seemed apprehensive of the ill temper any miscarriage, in a trial,\nupon _scire facias_ brought against the patentee, might occasion in both\nHouses, if the evidence were not laid as full before a jury, as it was\nbefore them,\" and did therefore, a second time, decline sending over\nany persons, papers or materials whatsoever, to support this charge\nbrought against your Majesty's patent and the patentee.\n\nAs this proceeding seemed very extraordinary, that in a matter that had\nraised so great and universal a clamour in Ireland, no one person could\nbe prevailed upon to come over from Ireland, in support of the united\nsense of both Houses of Parliament of Ireland; That no papers, no\nmaterials, no evidence whatsoever of the mischiefs arising from this\npatent, or of the notorious frauds and deceit committed in the execution\nof it, could now be had, to give your Majesty satisfaction herein; \"your\nMajesty however, desirous to give your people of Ireland all possible\nsatisfaction, but sensible that you cannot in any case proceed against\nany of the meanest of your subjects, but according to the known rules\nand maxims of law and justice,\" repeated your orders to your Lord\nLieutenant of Ireland, that by persuasion, and making proper allowances\nfor their expenses, new endeavours might be used to procure and send\nover such witnesses as should be thought material to make good the\ncharge against the patent.\n\nIn answer to these orders, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland acquaints your\nMajesty, by his letter of the 23d of April to one of your principal\nsecretaries of state, \"That in order to obey your Majesty's commands as\nfar as possibly he could, at a meeting with my Lord Chancellor, the\nChief Judges, your Majesty's Attorney and Solicitor-General, he had\nearnestly desired their advice and assistance, to enable him to send\nover such witnesses as might be necessary to support the charge against\nMr. Wood's patent, and the execution of it. The result of this meeting\nwas such, that the Lord Lieutenant could not reap the least advantage or\nassistance from it, every one being so guarded with caution, against\ngiving any advice or opinion in this matter of state, apprehending great\ndanger to themselves from meddling in it.\"\n\nThe Lords of the Committee think it very strange, that there should be\nsuch great difficulty in prevailing with persons, who had already given\ntheir evidence before the Parliament of Ireland, to come over and give\nthe same evidence here, and especially, that the chief difficulty should\narise, from a general apprehension of a miscarriage, in an enquiry\nbefore your Majesty, or in a proceeding by due course of law, in a case,\nwhere both Houses of Parliament had declared themselves so fully\nconvinced, and satisfied upon evidence, and examinations taken in the\nmost solemn manner.\n\nAt the same time that your Majesty sent your orders to the Lord\nLieutenant of Ireland, to send over such evidences as were thought\nmaterial to support the charge against the patent, that your Majesty\nmight, without any further loss of time than was absolutely necessary,\nbe as fully informed as was possible, and that the abuses and frauds\nalleged to be committed by the patentee, in executing the powers granted\nto him, might be fully and strictly enquired into, and examined, your\nMajesty was pleased to order that an assay should be made of the\nfineness, value, and weight of this copper money, and the goodness\nthereof, compared with the former coinages of copper money for Ireland,\nand the copper money coined in your Majesty's Mint in England; and it\nwas accordingly referred to Sir Isaac Newton, Edward Southwell, and\nThomas Scroope, Esqs. to make the said assay and trial.\n\nBy the reports made of this assay, which are hereunto annexed, it\nappears,[2] \"That the pix of the copper moneys coined at Bristol by Mr.\nWood for Ireland, containing the trial pieces, which was sealed and\nlocked up at the time of coining, was opened at your Majesty's mint at\nthe Tower; that the comptroller's account of the quantities of halfpence\nand farthings coined, agreed with Mr. Wood's account, amounting to 59\ntons, 3 hundred, 1 quarter, 11 pounds, and 4 ounces; That by the\nspecimens of this coinage, which had from time to time been taken from\nthe several parcels coined, and sealed up in papers, and put into the\npix, 60 halfpence weighed 14 ounces troy, and 18 penny-weight, which is\nabout a quarter of an ounce above one pound weight avoirdupois; and 30\nfarthings weighed 3 ounces and 3 quarters of an ounce troy, and 46\ngrams, which is also above the weight required by the patent. It also\nappears, that both halfpence and farthings when heated red-hot spread\nthin under the hammer without cracking; that the copper of which Mr.\nWood's coinage is made, is of the same goodness and value with the\ncopper of which the copper money is coined in your Majesty's mint for\nEngland, and worth in the market about 13 pence per pound weight\navoirdupois; That a pound of copper wrought into bars of fillets, and\nmade fit for coinage, before brought into the mint at the Tower of\nLondon, is worth 18 pence per pound, and always cost as much, and is\ncoined into 23 pence of copper money by tale, for England; It likewise\nappears, that the halfpence and farthings coined by Mr. Wood, when\ncompared with the copper money coined for Ireland, in the reigns of King\nCharles II. King James II. and King William and Queen Mary, considerably\nexceeds them all in weight, very far exceeds them all in goodness,\nfineness, and value of the copper, none of them bearing the fire so\nwell, not being malleable, wasting very much in the fire, and great part\nof them burning into a cinder of little or no value at all; Specimens\nof all which, as likewise of Mr. Wood's copper money, upon trials and\nassays made by Sir Isaac Newton, Mr. Southwell, and Mr. Scroope, were\nlaid before this Committee for their information.\"\n\n[Footnote 2: See Appendix, No. II. [T.S.]]\n\nThe Lords of the Committee beg leave upon this article of the complaint,\n\"That notorious frauds and deceits had been committed by the patentee,\nin executing the powers granted him,\" to observe to your Majesty, That\nthis is a fact expressly charged upon the patentee, and if it had in any\nmanner been proved, it might have enabled your Majesty, by due course of\nlaw, to have given the satisfaction to your people of Ireland, that has\nbeen so much insisted upon; but as it is now above four months since\nyour Majesty was pleased to send over to Ireland for such evidence, as\nmight prove a fact alleged to be so notorious, and no evidence at all\nhas been as yet transmitted, nor the least expectation given of any that\nmay hereafter be obtained, and the trials and assays that have been\ntaken of the halfpence, and farthings coined by Mr. Wood proving so\nunquestionably the weight, goodness and fineness of the copper money\ncoined, rather exceeding the conditions of the patent, than being any\nway defective, the Lords of the Committee cannot advise your Majesty, by\na writ of _scire facias_, or any other manner to endeavour vacating the\nsaid patent, when there is no probability of success in such an\nundertaking.\n\nAs these trials and assays fully shew that the patentee hath acted\nfairly according to the terms and conditions of his patent, so they\nevidently prove, that the care and caution made use of in this patent,\nby proper conditions, checks, and comptrols have effectually provided,\nthat the copper money coined for Ireland by virtue of this patent,\nshould far exceed the like coinages for Ireland, in the reigns of your\nMajesty's royal predecessors.\n\nAnd that your Majesty's royal predecessors have exercised this undoubted\nprerogative of granting to private persons the power and privilege of\ncoining copper halfpence and farthings for the kingdom of Ireland, was\nproved to this Committee by several precedents of such patents granted\nto private persons by King Charles II. and King James II. none of which\nwere equally beneficial to your kingdom of Ireland, nor so well guarded\nwith proper covenants and conditions for the due execution of the powers\nthereby granted, although the power and validity of those patents, and a\ndue compliance with them, was never in any one instance, till this time,\ndisputed or controverted.\n\nBy these former patents, the sole power of coining copper money for\nIreland, was granted to the patentees for the term of 21 years, to be\ncoined in such place as they should think convenient, and \"such\nquantities as they could conveniently issue within the term of 21\nyears,\" without any restriction of the quantity to be coined within the\nwhole term, or any provision of a certain quantity, only to be coined\nannually to prevent the ill consequences of too great a quantity to be\npoured in at once, at the will and pleasure of the patentees; no\nprovision was made for the goodness and fineness of the copper, no\ncomptroller appointed to inspect the copper in bars and fillets, before\ncoined, and take constant assays of the money when coined, and the power\nof issuing not limited \"to such as would voluntarily accept the same\";\nbut by the patent granted to John Knox, the money coined by virtue of\nthe patent, \"is made and declared to be the current coin of the kingdom\nof Ireland,\" and a pound weight of copper was allowed to be coined into\n2 shillings and 8 pence, and whatever quantity should be coined, a rent\nof 16_l_ _per annum_ only was reserved to the crown, and 700 tons of\ncopper were computed to be coined within the 21 years, without any\ncomplaint.\n\nThe term granted to Mr. Wood for coining copper money is for 14 years\nonly, the quantity for the whole term limited to 360 tons, 100 ton only\nto be issued within one year, and 20 tons each year for the 13 remaining\nyears; a comptroller is appointed by the authority of the crown to\ninspect, comptrol, and assay the copper, as well not coined as coined;\nthe copper to be fine British copper, cast into bars or fillets, which\nwhen heated red hot would spread thin under the hammer; a pound weight\nof copper to be coined into 2 shillings and sixpence, and without any\ncompulsion on currency enforced, to be received by such only as would\nvoluntarily and wilfully accept the same\"; a rent of 800_l_ _per annum_\nis reserved unto your Majesty,[3] and 200_l per annum_ to your Majesty's\nclerk comptroller, to be paid annually by the patentee, for the full\nterm of the fourteen years, which for 13 years when 20 tons of copper\nonly are coined, is not inconsiderable; these great and essential\ndifferences in the several patents, that have been granted for coining\ncopper money for the kingdom of Ireland, seemed sufficiently to justify\nthe care and caution that was used in granting the letters-patent to Mr.\nWood.\n\n[Footnote 3: See the extract from the patent itself, where the amount is\ngiven differently [T.S.]]\n\nIt has been further represented to your Majesty, That these\nletters-patent were obtained by Mr. Wood in a clandestine and\nunprecedent manner, and by gross misrepresentations of the state of the\nkingdom of Ireland. Upon enquiring into this fact it appears, That the\npetition of Mr. Wood for obtaining this coinage, was presented to your\nMajesty at the time that several other petitions and applications were\nmade to your Majesty, for the same purpose, by sundry persons, well\nacquainted and conversant with the affairs of Ireland, setting forth the\ngreat want of small money and change in all the common and lower parts\nof traffic, and business throughout the kingdom, and the terms of Mr.\nWood's petition seeming to your Majesty most reasonable, thereupon a\ndraught of a warrant directing a grant of such coinage to be made to Mr.\nWood, was referred to your Majesty's then Attorney and Solicitor-general\nof England, to consider and report their opinion to your Majesty; Sir\nIsaac Newton, as the Committee is informed was consulted in all the\nsteps of settling and adjusting the terms and conditions of the patent;\nand after mature deliberation, your Majesty's warrant was signed,\ndirecting an indenture in such manner as is practised in your Majesty's\nmint in the Tower of London, for the coining of gold and silver moneys,\nto pass the Great Seal of Great Britain, which was carried through all\nthe usual forms and offices without haste or precipitation, That the\nCommittee cannot discover the least pretence to say, this patent was\npassed or obtained in a clandestine or unprecedented manner, unless it\nis to be understood, that your Majesty's granting a liberty of coining\ncopper money for Ireland, under the Great Seal of Great Britain, without\nreferring the consideration thereof to the principal officers of\nIreland, is the grievance and mischief complained of. Upon this head it\nmust be admitted, that letters-patent under the Great Seal of Great\nBritain for coining copper money for Ireland, are legal and obligatory,\na just and reasonable exercise of your Majesty's royal prerogative, and\nin no manner derogatory, or invasive, of any liberties or privileges of\nyour subjects of Ireland. When any matter or thing is transacting that\nconcerns or may affect your kingdom of Ireland, if your Majesty has any\ndoubts concerning the same, or sees just cause for considering your\nofficers of Ireland, your Majesty is frequently pleased to refer such\nconsiderations to your chief governors of Ireland, but the Lords of the\nCommittee hope it will not be asserted, that any legal orders or\nresolutions of your Majesty can or ought to be called in question or\ninvalidated, because the advice or consent of your chief governors of\nthat kingdom was not previously had upon them: The precedents are many,\nwherein cases of great importance to Ireland, and that immediately\naffected, the interests of that kingdom, warrants, orders, and\ndirections, by the authority of your Majesty and your royal\npredecessors, have been issued under the royal sign manual, without any\nprevious reference, or advice of your officers of Ireland, which have\nalways had their due force, and have been punctually complied with and\nobeyed. And as it cannot be disputed but this patent might legally and\nproperly pass under the Great Seal of Great Britain, so their Lordships\ncannot find any precedents of references to the officers of Ireland, of\nwhat passed under the Great Seal of England; on the contrary, there are\nprecedents of patents passed under the Great Seal of Ireland, where in\nall the previous steps the references were made to the officers of\nEngland.\n\nBy the misrepresentation of the state of Ireland, in order to obtain\nthis patent, it is presumed, is meant, That the information given to\nyour Majesty of the great want of small money, to make small payments,\nwas groundless, and that there is no such want of small money: The Lords\nof the Committee enquired very particularly into this article, and Mr.\nWood produced several witnesses, that directly asserted the great want\nof small money for change, and the great damage that retailers and\nmanufactures suffered for want of such copper money. Evidence was given,\nThat considerable manufacturers have been obliged to give tallies, or\ntokens in cards, to their workmen for want of small money, signed upon\nthe back, to be afterwards exchanged for larger money: That a premium\nwas often given to obtain small money for necessary occasions: Several\nletters from Ireland to correspondents in England were read, complaining\nof the want of copper money, and expressing the great demand there was\nfor this money.\n\nThe great want of small money was further proved by the common use of\n_raps_, a counterfeit coin, of such base metal, that what passes for a\nhalfpenny, is not worth half a farthing, which raps appear to have\nobtained a currency, out of necessity and for want of better small money\nto make change with, and by the best accounts, the Lords of the\nCommittee have reason to believe, That there can be no doubt, that there\nis a real want of small money in Ireland, which seems to be so far\nadmitted on all hands, that there does not appear to have been any\nmisrepresentation of the state of Ireland in this respect.\n\nIn the second address from the House of Commons to your Majesty, They\nmost humbly beseech your Majesty, that you will be graciously pleased to\ngive directions to the several officers intrusted with the receipt of\nyour Majesty's revenue, that they do not, on any pretence whatsoever,\nreceive or utter such halfpence or farthings, and Mr. Wood, in his\npetition to your Majesty, complains, that the officers of your Majesty's\nrevenue had already given such orders to all the inferior officers not\nto receive any of this coin.\n\nYour Majesty, by your patent under the Great Seal of Great Britain,\nwills, requires and commands your \"lieutenant, deputy, or other chief\ngovernor or governors of your kingdom of Ireland, and all other officers\nand ministers of your Majesty, your heirs and successors in England,\nIreland or elsewhere, to be aiding and assisting to the said William\nWood, his executors, &c. in the execution of all or any the powers,\nauthorities, directions, matters or things to be executed by him or\nthem, or for his or their benefit and advantage, by virtue, and in\npursuance of the said indentures, in all things as becometh, &c.\" And if\nthe officers of the revenue have, upon their own authority, given any\norders, directions, significations, or intimations, to hinder or\nobstruct the receiving and uttering the copper money coined and\nimported, pursuant to your Majesty's letters-patent, this cannot but be\nlooked upon as a very extraordinary proceeding.\n\nIn another paragraph of the patent your Majesty has covenanted and\ngranted unto the said William Wood, his executors, &c. \"That upon\nperformance of covenants, on his and their parts, he and they shall\npeaceably, and quietly, have, hold, and enjoy all the powers,\nauthorities, privileges, licences, profits, advantages, and all other\nmatters and things thereby granted, without any let, suit, trouble,\nmolestation or denial of your Majesty, your heirs or successors, or of\nor by any of your or their officers or ministers, or any person or\npersons, &c.\" This being so expressly granted and covenanted by your\nMajesty, and there appearing no failure, non-performance, or breach of\ncovenants, on the part of the patentee, the Lords of the Committee\ncannot advise your Majesty to give directions to the officers of the\nrevenue, not to receive or utter any of the said copper halfpence or\nfarthings as has been desired.\n\nMr. Wood having been heard by his counsel, produced his several\nwitnesses, all the papers and precedents, which he thought material,\nhaving been read and considered, and having as he conceived, fully\nvindicated both the patent, and the execution thereof. For his further\njustification, and to clear himself from the imputation of attempting to\nmake to himself any unreasonable profit or advantage, and to enrich\nhimself at the expense of the kingdom of Ireland, by endeavouring to\nimpose upon them, and utter a greater quantity of copper money, than the\nnecessary occasions of the people shall require, and can easily take\noff, delivered a proposal in writing, signed by himself, which is\nhereunto annexed, and Mr. Wood having by the said letters-patent,\n\"covenanted, granted, and promised to, and with your Majesty, your heirs\nand successors, that he shall and will from time to time in the making\nthe said copper farthings and halfpence in England, and in transporting\nthe same from time to time to Ireland, and in uttering, vending,\ndisposing and dispersing the same there, and in all his doings and\naccounts concerning the same, submit himself to the inspection,\nexamination, order and comptrol of your Majesty and your commissioners\nof the treasury or high-treasurer for the time being;\" the Lords of the\nCommittee are of opinion, that your Majesty upon this voluntary offer\nand proposal of Mr. Wood, may give proper orders and directions for the\nexecution and due performance of such parts of the said proposal, as\nshall be judged most for the interest and accommodation of your subjects\nof Ireland: In the mean time, it not appearing to their Lordships that\nMr. Wood has done or committed any act or deed, that may tend to\ninvalidate, or make void his letters-patent, or to forfeit the\nprivileges and advantages thereby granted to him by your Majesty; It is\nbut just and reasonable, that your Majesty should immediately send\norders to your commissioners of the revenue, and all other your officers\nin Ireland, to revoke all orders, directions, significations, or\nintimations whatsoever, that may have been given by them, or any of\nthem, to hinder or obstruct the receiving and uttering this copper\nmoney, and that the halfpence and farthings already coined by Mr. Wood,\namounting to about 17,000_l_. and such further quantity as shall make up\nthe said 17,000_l_. to 40,000_l_. \"be suffered and permitted without any\nlet, suit, trouble, molestation, or denial of any of your Majesty's\nofficers or ministers whatsoever, to pass, and be received as current\nmoney by such as shall be willing to receive the same.\" At the same\ntime, it may be advisable for your Majesty, to give the proper orders,\nthat Mr. Wood shall not coin, import into Ireland, utter or dispose of\nany more copper halfpence or farthings, than to the amount of 40,000_l_.\naccording to his own proposal, without your Majesty's special licence or\nauthority, to be had for that purpose; and if your Majesty shall be\npleased to order, that Mr. Wood's proposal, delivered to the Lords of\nthe Committee, shall be transmitted to your Majesty's chief governor,\ndeputies, or other your ministers, or officers in Ireland, it will give\nthem a proper opportunity to consider, Whether, after the reduction of\n360 tons of copper, being in value 100,800_l_. to 142 tons, 17 hundred,\n16 pounds being in value 40,000_l_. only, anything can be done for the\nfurther satisfaction of the people of Ireland.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER III.\n\nTO THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY OF THE KINGDOM OF IRELAND.\n\n\nNOTE.\n\nThe Drapier's second letter was dated August 4th, 1724. A few days\nlater the English Privy Council's Report, dated 24th July, 1724, arrived\nin Dublin, and on August 25th, Swift had issued his reply to it in this\nthird letter.\n\nThe Report itself, which is here prefixed to the third letter, was said\nto have been the work of Walpole. Undoubtedly, it contains the best\narguments that could then be urged in favour of Wood and the patent, and\nundoubtedly, also, it would have had the desired effect had it been\nallowed to do its work uncriticised. But Swift's opposition was fatal to\nWalpole's intentions. He took the report as but another attempt to foist\non the people of Ireland a decree in which they had not been consulted,\nand no amount of yielding, short of complete abandonment of it, would\npalliate the thing that was hateful in itself. He resented the insult.\nAfter specific rebuttals of the various arguments urged in the report in\nfavour of the patent, Swift suddenly turns from the comparatively petty\nand insignificant consideration as to the weight and quality of the\ncoins, and deals with the broad principle of justice which the granting\nof the patent had ignored. Had the English Houses of Parliament and the\nEnglish Privy Council, he said, addressed the King against a similar\nbreach of the English people's rights, his Majesty would not have waited\nto discuss the matter, nor would his ministers have dared to advise him\nas they had done in this instance. \"Am I a free man in England,\" he\nexclaims, \"and do I become a slave in six hours in crossing the\nchannel?\"\n\nThe report, however, is interesting inasmuch as it assists us to\nappreciate the pathetic condition of Irish affairs at the time. The very\nfact that the petition of the Irish parliament could be so handled,\nproves how strong had been the hold over Ireland by England, and with\nwhat daring insistence the English ministers continued to efface the\nlast strongholds of Irish independence.\n\nMonck Mason, in reviewing the report, has devoted a very elaborate note\nto its details, and has fortified his criticisms with a series of\nremarkable letters from the Archbishop of Dublin, which he publishes for\nthe first time.[1] I have embodied much of this note in the annotations\nwhich accompany the present reprint of this letter.\n\n[Footnote 1: \"History of St. Patrick's Cathedral,\" pp. lxxxvi-xcv.]\n\nThe text of this third letter is based on Sir W. Scott's, collated with\nthe first edition and that given by Faulkner in \"Fraud Detected.\" It has\nalso been read with Faulkner's text given in the fourth volume of his\nedition of Swift's Works, published in 1735.\n\n[T.S.]\n\n\n[Illustration:\n                SOME\n\n     Upon a PAPER, Call'd, The\n\n               OF THE\n\n               OF THE\n Most Honourable the _Privy-Council_\n                 IN\n\n  Relating to WOOD's _Half-pence_.\n\n\n       _By_.  M.B. _Drapier_.\n    AUTHOR of the LETTER to the\n        _SHOP-KEEPERS_, &c.\n\n              DUBLIN:\n    Printed by _John Harding_ in\n_Molesworth's-Court_ in _Fishamble Street_.\n]\n\n\n\nLETTER III.\n\nTO THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY OF THE KINGDOM OF IRELAND.\n\n\nHaving already written two letters to people of my own level, and\ncondition; and having now very pressing occasion for writing a third; I\nthought I could not more properly address it than to your lordships and\nworships.\n\nThe occasion is this. A printed paper was sent to me on the 18th\ninstant, entitled, \"A Report of the Committee of the Lords of His\nMajesty's Most Honourable Privy-Council in England, relating to Mr.\nWood's Halfpence and Farthings.\"[2] There is no mention made where the\npaper was printed, but I suppose it to have been in Dublin; and I have\nbeen told that the copy did not come over in the Gazette, but in the\nLondon Journal, or some other print of no authority or consequence; and\nfor anything that legally appears to the contrary, it may be a\ncontrivance to fright us, or a project of some printer, who hath a mind\nto make a penny by publishing something upon a subject, which now\nemploys all our thoughts in this kingdom. Mr. Wood in publishing this\npaper would insinuate to the world, as if the Committee had a greater\nconcern for his credit and private emolument, than for the honour of the\nPrivy-council and both Houses of Parliament here, and for the quiet and\nwelfare of this whole kingdom; For it seems intended as a vindication of\nMr. Wood, not without several severe remarks on the Houses of Lords and\nCommons of Ireland.\n\n[Footnote 2: The full text of this report is prefixed to this third\nletter of the Drapier. The report was published in the \"London Journal\"\nabout the middle of August of 1724. Neither the \"Gazette\" nor any other\nministerial organ printed it, which evidently gave Swift his cue to\nattack it in the merciless manner he did. Monck Mason thought it \"not\nimprobable that the minister [Walpole] adopted this method of\ncommunication, because it served his own purpose; he dared not to stake\nhis credit upon such a document, which, in its published form, contains\nsome gross mis-statements\" (\"History of St. Patrick's Cathedral,\" note,\non p. 336). [T.S.]]\n\nThe whole is indeed written with the turn and air of a pamphlet, as if\nit were a dispute between William Wood on the one part, and the Lords\nJustices, Privy-council and both Houses of Parliament on the other; the\ndesign of it being to clear and vindicate the injured reputation of\nWilliam Wood, and to charge the other side with casting rash and\ngroundless aspersions upon him.\n\nBut if it be really what the title imports, Mr. Wood hath treated the\nCommittee with great rudeness, by publishing an act of theirs in so\nunbecoming a manner, without their leave, and before it was communicated\nto the government and Privy-council of Ireland, to whom the Committee\nadvised that it should be transmitted. But with all deference be it\nspoken, I do not conceive that a Report of a Committee of the Council in\nEngland is hitherto a law in either kingdom; and until any point is\ndetermined to be a law, it remains disputable by every subject.\n\nThis (may it please your lordships and worships) may seem a strange way\nof discoursing in an illiterate shopkeeper. I have endeavoured (although\nwithout the help of books) to improve that small portion of reason which\nGod hath pleased to give me, and when reason plainly appears before me,\nI cannot turn away my head from it. Thus for instance, if any lawyer\nshould tell me that such a point were law, from which many gross\npalpable absurdities must follow, I would not, I could not believe him.\nIf Sir Edward Coke should positively assert (which he nowhere does, but\nthe direct contrary) that a limited prince, could by his prerogative\noblige his subjects to take half an ounce of lead, stamped with his\nimage, for twenty shillings in gold, I should swear he was deceived or a\ndeceiver, because a power like that, would leave the whole lives and\nfortunes of the people entirely at the mercy of the monarch: Yet this,\nin effect, is what Wood hath advanced in some of his papers, and what\nsuspicious people may possibly apprehend from some passages in that\nwhich is called the \"Report.\"\n\nThat paper mentions \"such persons to have been examined, who were\ndesirous and willing to be heard upon that subject.\" I am told, they\nwere four in all, Coleby, Brown, Mr. Finley the banker, and one more\nwhose name I know not. The first of these was tried for robbing the\nTreasury in Ireland, and although he was acquitted for want of legal\nproof, yet every person in the Court believed him to be guilty. The\nsecond was tried for a rape, and stands recorded in the votes of the\nHouse of Commons, for endeavouring by perjury and subornation, to take\naway the life of John Bingham, Esq.[3]\n\n[Footnote 3: Referring to these persons who were examined by the\nCommittee, Monck Mason quotes from two letters from Archbishop King to\nEdward Southwell, Esq. King was one of the council, and Southwell\nsecretary of state at the time. The first of these letters remarks:\n\"Could a greater contempt be put upon a nation, than to see such a\nlittle fellow as Wood favoured and supported against them, and such\nprofligates as Brown and Coleby believed before a whole parliament,\ngovernment, and private council.\" From the second letter, written on\nAugust 15th, 1724, Monck Mason gives the following extracts:\n\n\"--When I returned to Dublin I met with resolutions concerning our\nhalfpence, founded chiefly on the testimony of two infamous persons,\nJohn Brown and Coleby: as to the first of these, you will find his\ncharacter in the votes of the house of commons, last parliament.\nTuesday, the 5th of November.\n\n\"'Resolved, that it appears to this Committee, that a wicked conspiracy\nwas maliciously contrived and carried on against John Bingham, to take\naway his life and fortune.\n\n\"'Resolved, that it is the opinion of this Committee, that the said John\nBrown, of Rabens, Esq. and his accomplices, were the chief promoters and\nadvisers of the said conspiracy.\n\n\"'Resolved, that it is the opinion of this Committee, that the said John\nBrown is a person not fit to serve his majesty, in any office or\nemployment, civil or military, whatsoever.\n\n\"'Resolved, that the said John Brown has, in the course of his\nexamination, grossly prevaricated with this Committee.\n\n\"'To all which resolutions, the question being severally put, the house\ndid agree, _nemine contradicente_.\n\n\"'Ordered, that the said John Brown be, for his said prevarication,\ntaken into the custody of the serjeant at arms attending this house.\n\n\"'Ordered, that his majesty's attorney-general do present the said John\nBrown, for conniving and maliciously carrying on the said conspiracy to\ntake away the life of the said John Bingham, and others.'\n\n\"As to Coleby, he was turned out of the treasury for robbing it of a\nconsiderable sum of money. I was present at his trial at the\nKing's-bench, and the evidence was such as convinced every one, in his\nconscience, that he was guilty; but, the proofs being presumptive, and\nnot direct, the jury acquitted him; on which the judge (Pine, if I\nremember right) observed the happiness of English subjects, that, though\neverybody was convinced of a man's guilt, yet, if the evidence did not\ncome up to the strict requisites of the law, he would escape\" (\"History\nof St. Patrick's Cathedral,\" pp. xciv-xcv.) [T.S.]]\n\nBut since I have gone so far as to mention particular persons, it may be\nsome satisfaction to know who is this Wood himself, that has the honour\nto have a whole kingdom at his mercy, for almost two years together. I\nfind he is in the patent entitled _Esq_; although he were understood to\nbe only a hardware-man, and so I have been bold to call him in my former\nletters; however a '_squire_ he is, not only by virtue of his patent,\nbut by having been a collector in Shropshire, where pretending to have\nbeen robbed, and suing the county, he was cast, and for the infamy of\nthe fact, lost his employment.\n\nI have heard another story of this 'Squire Wood from a very honourable\nlady, that one Hamilton told her. He (Hamilton) was sent for six years\nago by Sir Isaac Newton to try the coinage of four men, who then\nsolicited a patent for coining halfpence for Ireland; their names were\nWood, Coster, Elliston, and Parker. Parker made the fairest offer, and\nWood the worst, for his coin were three halfpence in a pound less value\nthan the other. By which it is plain with what intentions he solicited\nthis patent, but not so plain how he obtained it.\n\nIt is alleged in the said paper, called the \"Report,\" that upon repeated\norders from a secretary of state, for sending over such papers and\nwitnesses, as should be thought proper to support the objections made\nagainst the patent (by both Houses of Parliament) the Lord Lieutenant\nrepresented \"the great difficulty he found himself in to comply with\nthese orders. That none of the principal members of both Houses, who\nwere in the King's service or council, would take upon them to advise\nhow any material person or papers might be sent over on this occasion,\n&c.\" And this is often repeated and represented as \"a proceeding that\nseems very extraordinary, and that in a matter which had raised so great\na clamour in Ireland, no one person could be prevailed upon to come over\nfrom Ireland in support of the united sense of both Houses of Parliament\nin Ireland, especially that the chief difficulty should arise from a\ngeneral apprehension of a miscarriage, in an enquiry before His\nMajesty, or in a proceeding by due course of law, in a case where both\nHouses of Parliament had declared themselves so fully convinced, and\nsatisfied upon evidence, and examinations taken in the most solemn\nmanner.\"[4]\n\n[Footnote 4: Commenting on this Monck Mason has the following note. This\nlearned biographer's remarks are specially important inasmuch as he has\nfortified them with letters from Archbishop King, unpublished at the\ntime he wrote: \"But this [referring to the extract from the Report given\nby Swift] will not appear so strange or inexplicable after perusing the\nfollowing letter from Archbishop King ... to Edward Southwell, Esq. ...;\nthis important state paper may, therefore, be considered as an official\ncommunication of the sentiments of the Irish Privy Council upon this\nmatter.\n\n\"Letter from William King, Archbishop of Dublin, to Edward Southwell,\nEsq., dated the 23d March, 1723.\n\n\"'I have not had any occasion of late to trouble you with my letters;\nbut yesternight I came to the knowledge of an affair which gave me some\nuneasiness, and, I believe, will do so to the whole kingdom, when it\nbecomes public. My lord lieutenant sent for several lords and commoners\nof the privy council, and communicated to them a letter from my Lord\nCarteret, writ by his majesty's command, in which was repeated the\nanswer given to the addresses of the lords and commons, about one\nWilliam Wood's farthings and halfpence; and his grace is required to\nsend over witnesses and evidences against the patentee or patent: this\nhas surprised most people, because we were borne in hand that that\naffair was dead, and that we should never hear any more of it.\n\n\"'His grace's design was, to be advised by what means and methods he\nmight effectually comply with his majesty's commands; and, by what I\ncould perceive, it was the sense of all, that it was not possible, in\nthe present situation of affairs, to answer his majesty's expectations\nor those of the kingdom; and that, for these reasons:\n\n\"'1st, because this is a controversy between the parliament of Ireland\nand William Wood, and, the parliament being now prorogued, nobody either\nwould, or durst, take on them to meddle in a business attacked by the\nparliament, or pretend to manage a cause which so deeply concerned the\nparliament, and the whole nation, without express orders. If this letter\nhad come whilst the parliament was sitting, and had been communicated to\nthe houses, they could have appointed certain persons to have acted for\nthem, and raised a fund to support them, as has been done formerly in\nthis kingdom on several occasions; but, for any, without such authority,\nto make himself a party for the legislature and people of Ireland, would\nbe a bold undertaking, and, perhaps, dangerous; for, if such undertaker\nor undertakers should fail in producing all evidences that may be had,\nor any of the papers necessary to make the case evident, they must\nexpect to be severely handled the next parliament for their\nofficiousness, and bear the blame of the miscarriage of the cause: for\nthese reasons, as it seemed to me, the privy councillors were unwilling\nto engage at all in the business, or to meddle with it.\n\n\"'But, 2dly, the thing seemed impracticable; because it would signify\nnothing to send over the copies of the papers that were laid before the\nparliament, if the design is, as it seems to be, to bring the patent to\na legal trial; for such copies we were told by lawyers, could not be\nproduced in any court as evidence; and, as to the originals, they are in\nthe possession of the houses, and (as was conceived) could not be taken\nfrom the proper officers with whom they were trusted, but by the like\norder.\n\n\"'And, as to the witnesses, it was a query whether my lord lieutenant by\nhis own power could send them; and, if he have such power, yet it will\nnot be possible to come at the witnesses, for several in each house\nvouched several facts on their own knowledge, to whom the houses gave\ncredit; my lord lieutenant can neither be apprised of the persons nor of\nthe particulars which the members testified; whereas, if the parliament\nwas sitting, those members would appear, and make good their assertions.\n\n\"'There were several sorts of farthings and halfpence produced to the\nhouses, differing in weight, and there was likewise a difference in the\nstamp. These were sent over by William Wood to his correspondents here,\nand by them produced. But can it be proved, on a legal trial, that these\nparticular halfpence were coined by him? It is easy for him to say, that\nthey are counterfeited, as (if I remember right) he has already affirmed\nin the public prints, in his answer to the address of the commons.\n\n\"'But, 3dly, it was not on the illegality of the patent, nor chiefly on\nthe abuse of it the patentee (which was not so much as mentioned by the\nlords), that the parliament insisted, but on the unavoidable mischief\nand destruction it would bring on the kingdom, and on its being obtained\nby most false and notorious misinformation of his majesty; it being\nsuggested, as appears by the preamble, that the kingdom wanted such\nhalfpence and farthings: now, if the king be misinformed, the lawyers\ntell us, that the grant is void. And, that his majesty was deceived in\nthis grant by a false representation, it was said, needed no further\nproof than the patent itself.--William Wood by it was empowered to coin\n360 tons of copper into halfpence and farthings, which would have made\n£90,000, about the fifth part of all the current cash of Ireland; for\nthat is not reckoned, by those who suppose it most, to be £500,000. Now,\nthe current cash of England is reckoned above twenty millions; in\nproportion, therefore, if Ireland wants £90,000 England will want four\nmillions. It is easy to imagine what would be said to a man that would\npropose to his majesty such a coinage; and it is agreed, that the people\nof England would not be more alarmed by such a patent, than the people\nof Ireland are, by the prospect of turning the fifth part of their\ncurrent coin into brass.\n\n\"'This, so far as I can remember, is a brief of what passed in the\nmeeting before my lord lieutenant'\" (\"History of St. Patrick's\nCathedral,\" pp. lxxxvii-lxxxviii). [T.S.]]\n\nHow shall I, a poor ignorant shopkeeper, utterly unskilled in law, be\nable to answer so weighty an objection. I will try what can be done by\nplain reason, unassisted by art, cunning or eloquence.\n\nIn my humble opinion, the committee of council, hath already prejudged\nthe whole case, by calling the united sense of both Houses of\nParliament in Ireland an \"universal clamour.\" Here the addresses of the\nLords and Commons of Ireland against a ruinous destructive project of an\n\"obscure, single undertaker,\" is called a \"clamour.\" I desire to know\nhow such a style would be resented in England from a committee of\ncouncil there to a Parliament, and how many impeachments would follow\nupon it. But supposing the appellation to be proper, I never heard of a\nwise minister who despised the universal clamour of a people, and if\nthat clamour can be quieted by disappointing the fraudulent practice of\na single person, the purchase is not exorbitant.\n\nBut in answer to this objection. First it is manifest, that if this\ncoinage had been in Ireland, with such limitations as have been formerly\nspecified in other patents, and granted to persons of this kingdom, or\neven of England, able to give sufficient security, few or no\ninconveniencies could have happened, which might not have been\nimmediately remedied. As to Mr. Knox's patent mentioned in the Report,\nsecurity was given into the exchequer, that the patentee should at any\ntime receive his halfpence back, and pay gold or silver in exchange for\nthem. And Mr. Moor (to whom I suppose that patent was made over) was in\n1694 forced to leave off coining, before the end of that year, by the\ngreat crowds of people continually offering to return his coinage upon\nhim. In 1698 he coined again, and was forced to give over for the same\nreason. This entirely alters the case; for there is no such condition in\nWood's patent, which condition was worth a hundred times all other\nlimitations whatsoever.[5]\n\n[Footnote 5: It will serve to elucidate this paragraph if an account be\ngiven of the various coinage patents issued for Ireland. Monck Mason\ngives an account in a long note to his biography of Swift; but as he has\nobtained it from the very ably written tract, \"A Defence of the Conduct\nof the People of Ireland,\" etc., I have gone to that pamphlet for the\npresent _résumé_. I quote from pp. 21-24 of the Dublin edition, issued\nin 1724 and printed by George Ewing:\n\n\"K. Charles 2d. 1660 granted a patent for coining only farthings for the\nkingdom of Ireland to Coll. Armstrong: But I do not find he ever made\nany use of it.[A] For all our copper and brass money to the year 1680\nwas issued by private persons, who obtained particular licences, _on\ngiving security to change their half-pence and farthings for gold and\nsilver_; but some of their securities failing, others pretending the\nhalf-pence which were tendered to be changed were counterfeits, the\npublic always suffered. Col. Armstrong's son, finding great profit was\nmade by coining half-pence in Ireland, by virtue of particular licences\nrecallable at pleasure, solicited and obtained a patent in the name of\nGeorge Legg afterwards Lord Dartmouth, for coining half-pence for\nIreland from 1680, for 21 years, _he giving security to exchange them\nfor gold or silver on demand_.[B] In pursuance of this he coined\nconsiderable quantities of half-pence for four years; but in 1685 [John]\nKnox, with the consent of Armstrong, got the remaining part of this term\ngranted by patent in his own name, he giving security as above, and got\nhis half-pence declared the current coin of Ireland, notwithstanding two\nActs of Parliament had enacted that they should not be received in the\nrevenue. Knox was interrupted in his coinage in 1689, by King James's\ntaking it into his own hands, to coin his famous brass money, of which\nhe coined no less than £965,375, three penny worth of metal passing for\n£10 _ster_. In this money creditors were obliged to receive their debts,\nand by this cruel stratagem Ireland lost about £60,000 per month. This\nnot only made our gold and silver, but even our half-pence to disappear;\nwhich obliged King William to coin pewter half-pence for the use of his\narmy....\n\n[Footnote A: Monck Mason, quoting Simon \"On Irish Coins\" (Append., No.\nLXV), says: \"Sir Thomas [Armstrong] was never admitted to make use of\nthis grant, nor could he obtain allowance of the chief governor of\nIreland, to issue them as royal coin among the subjects of that\nkingdom.\"]\n\n[Footnote B: \"A proclamation was issued by the lord lieutenant,\ndeclaring these half-pence to be the current coin of the kingdom, but it\nprovided that none should be enforced to take more than five shillings\nin the payment of one hundred pounds, and so proportionately in all\ngreater and lesser sums.... This patent was granted, by and with, the\nadvice of James, Duke of Ormond\" (Monck Mason, \"History of St.\nPatrick's,\" p. 334, note y).]\n\n\"After the Revolution, Col. Roger Moore being possessed of Knox's\npatent, commenced his coinage in Dublin, and at first kept several\noffices for changing his half-pence for gold or silver. He soon\noverstocked the kingdom so with copper money, that persons were obliged\nto receive large sums in it; for the officers of the crown were\nindustrious dispensers of it, for which he allowed them a premium. It\nwas common at that time for one to compound for 1/4 copper, and the\ncollectors paid nothing else. The country being thus overcharged with a\nbase coin, everyone tendered it to Col. Moore to be changed. This he\nrefused, on pretence they were counterfeits.... On this he quitted\ncoining in 1698, but left us in a miserable condition, which is lively\nrepresented in a Memorial presented by Will. Trench, Esq. to the Lords\nof the Treasury, on Mr. Wood's obtaining his patent, and which our\nCommissioners referred to.... Col. Moore finding the sweet of such a\npatent, applied to King William for a renewal of it; but his petition\nbeing referred to the government of Ireland, the affair was fairly\nrepresented to the king, whereby his designs were frustrated.\n\n\"In the reign of the late Queen, application was made by Robert Baird\nand William Harnill, Trustees for the garrison which defended\nLondonderry, for a patent to coin base money for Ireland ... their\npetition was rejected.... Since this time there have been many\napplications made for such patents.\" [T.S.]]\n\nPut the case, that the two Houses of Lords and Commons of England, and\nthe Privy-council there should address His Majesty to recall a patent,\nfrom whence they apprehend the most ruinous consequences to the whole\nkingdom: And to make it stronger if possible, that the whole nation,\nalmost to a man, should thereupon discover the \"most dismal\napprehensions\" (as Mr. Wood styles them) would His Majesty debate half\nan hour what he had to do? Would any minister dare advise him against\nrecalling such a patent? Or would the matter be referred to the\nPrivy-Council or to Westminster-hall, the two Houses of Parliament\nplaintiffs, and William Wood defendant? And is there even the smallest\ndifference between the two cases?\n\nWere not the people of Ireland born as free as those of England? How\nhave they forfeited their freedom? Is not their Parliament as fair a\nrepresentative of the people as that of England? And hath not their\nPrivy-council as great or a greater share in the administration of\npublic affairs? Are they not subjects of the same King? Does not the\nsame sun shine on them? And have they not the same God for their\nprotector? Am I a freeman in England, and do I become a slave in six\nhours by crossing the Channel? No wonder then, if the boldest persons\nwere cautious to interpose in a matter already determined by the whole\nvoice of the nation, or to presume to represent the representatives of\nthe kingdom, and were justly apprehensive of meeting such a treatment as\nthey would deserve at the next session. It would seem very extraordinary\nif an inferior court in England, should take a matter out of the hands\nof the high court of Parliament, during a prorogation, and decide it\nagainst the opinion of both Houses.\n\nIt happens however, that, although no persons were so bold, as to go\nover as evidences, to prove the truth of the objections made against\nthis patent by the high court of Parliament here, yet these objections\nstand good, notwithstanding the answers made by Wood and his Council.\n\nThe Report says, that \"upon an assay made of the fineness, weight and\nvalue of this copper, it exceeded in every article.\" This is possible\nenough in the pieces upon which the assay was made; but Wood must have\nfailed very much in point of dexterity, if he had not taken care to\nprovide a sufficient quantity of such halfpence as would bear the trial;\nwhich he was well able to do, although \"they were taken out of several\nparcels.\" Since it is now plain, that the bias of favour hath been\nwholly on his side.[6]\n\n[Footnote 6: The report of the assayers as abstracted by the Lords of\nthe Committee in their report is not accurately stated. Monck Mason\nnotes that the abstract omits the following passage: \"But although the\ncopper was very good, and the money, one piece with another, was full\nweight, yet the single pieces were not so equally coined in the weight\nas they should have been.\" Nor is it shown that the coins assayed were\nof the same kind as those sent into Ireland. The Committee's report\nfails to see the question that must arise when it is noted that while in\nEngland a pound of copper was made into twenty-three pence, yet for\nIreland Wood was permitted to make it into thirty pence, in spite of the\nstatement that the copper used in England was worth fivepence a pound\nmore than that used by Wood. [T.S.]]\n\nBut what need is there of disputing, when we have positive demonstration\nof Wood's fraudulent practices in this point? I have seen a large\nquantity of these halfpence weighed by a very skilful person, which were\nof four different kinds, three of them considerably under weight. I have\nnow before me an exact computation of the difference of weight between\nthese four sorts, by which it appears that the fourth sort, or the\nlightest, differs from the first to a degree, that, in the coinage of\nthree hundred and sixty tons of copper, the patentee will be a gainer,\nonly by that difference, of twenty-four thousand four hundred and\nninety-four pounds, and in the whole, the public will be a loser of\neighty-two thousand one hundred and sixty-eight pounds, sixteen\nshillings, even supposing the metal in point of goodness to answer\nWood's contract and the assay that hath been made; which it infallibly\ndoth not. For this point hath likewise been enquired into by very\nexperienced men, who, upon several trials in many of these halfpence,\nhave found them to be at least one fourth part below the real value (not\nincluding the raps or counterfeits that he or his accomplices have\nalready made of his own coin, and scattered about). Now the coinage of\nthree hundred and sixty ton of copper coined by the weight of the fourth\nor lightest sort of his halfpence will amount to one hundred twenty-two\nthousand four hundred eighty-eight pounds, sixteen shillings, and if we\nsubtract a fourth part of the real value by the base mixture in the\nmetal, we must add to the public loss one fourth part to be subtracted\nfrom the intrinsic value of the copper, which in three hundred and sixty\ntons amounts to ten thousand and eighty pounds, and this added to the\nformer sum of eighty-two thousand one hundred sixty-eight pounds,\nsixteen shillings, will make in all, ninety-two thousand two hundred\nforty-eight pounds loss to the public; besides the raps or counterfeits\nthat he may at any time hereafter think fit to coin. Nor do I know\nwhether he reckons the dross exclusive or inclusive with his three\nhundred and sixty ton of copper; which however will make a considerable\ndifference in the account.\n\nYou will here please to observe, that the profit allowed to Wood by the\npatent is twelvepence out of every pound of copper valued at _1s. 6d_.\nwhereas _5d_. only is allowed for coinage of a pound weight for the\nEnglish halfpence, and this difference is almost 25 _per cent_. which is\ndouble to the highest exchange of money, even under all the additional\npressures, and obstructions to trade, that this unhappy kingdom lies at\npresent. This one circumstance in the coinage of three hundred and sixty\nton of copper makes a difference of twenty-seven thousand seven hundred\nand twenty pounds between English and Irish halfpence, even allowing\nthose of Wood to be all of the heaviest sort.\n\nIt is likewise to be considered, that for every halfpenny in a pound\nweight exceeding the number directed by the patent, Wood will be a\ngainer in the coinage of three hundred and sixty ton of copper, sixteen\nhundred and eighty pounds profit more than the patent allows him; Out of\nwhich he may afford to make his comptrollers easy upon that article.\n\nAs to what is alleged, that \"these halfpence far exceed the like coinage\nfor Ireland in the reigns of His Majesty's predecessors;\" there cannot\nwell be a more exceptionable way of arguing: Although the fact were\ntrue, which however is altogether mistaken; not by any fault in the\nCommittee, but by the fraud and imposition of Wood, who certainly\nproduced the worst patterns he could find, such as were coined in small\nnumbers by permissions to private men, as butchers' halfpence, black\ndogs and the like, or perhaps the small St. Patrick's coin which passes\nfor a farthing, or at best some of the smallest raps of the latest kind.\nFor I have now by me some halfpence coined in the year 1680 by virtue of\nthe patent granted to my Lord Dartmouth, which was renewed to Knox, and\nthey are heavier by a ninth part than those of Wood, and in much better\nmetal. And the great St. Patrick's halfpenny is yet larger than either.\n\nBut what is all this to the present debate? If under the various\nexigencies of former times, by wars, rebellions, and insurrections, the\nKings of England were sometimes forced to pay their armies here with\nmixed or base money, God forbid that the necessities of turbulent times\nshould be a precedent for times of peace, and order, and settlement.\n\nIn the patent above mentioned granted to Lord Dartmouth, in the reign of\nKing Charles 2d. and renewed to Knox, the securities given into the\nexchequer, obliging the patentee to receive his money back upon every\ndemand, were an effectual remedy against all inconveniencies. And the\ncopper was coined in our own kingdom, so that we were in no danger to\npurchase it with the loss of all our silver and gold carried over to\nanother, nor to be at the trouble of going to England for the redressing\nof any abuse.\n\nThat the Kings of England have exercised their prerogative of coining\ncopper for Ireland and for England is not the present question: But (to\nspeak in the style of the Report) it would \"seem a little\nextraordinary,\" supposing a King should think fit to exercise his\nprerogative by coining copper in Ireland, to be current in England,\nwithout referring it to his officers in that kingdom to be informed\nwhether the grant was reasonable, and whether the people desired it or\nno, and without regard to the addresses of his Parliament against it.\nGod forbid that so mean a man as I should meddle with the King's\nprerogative: But I have heard very wise men say, that the King's\nprerogative is bounded and limited by the good and welfare of his\npeople. I desire to know, whether it is not understood and avowed that\nthe good of Ireland was intended by this patent. But Ireland is not\nconsulted at all in the matter, and as soon as Ireland is informed of\nit, they declare against it; the two Houses of Parliament and the\nPrivy-council addresses His Majesty upon the mischiefs apprehended by\nsuch a patent. The Privy-council in England takes the matter out of the\nParliament's cognizance; the good of the kingdom is dropped, and it is\nnow determined that Mr. Wood shall have the power of ruining a whole\nnation for his private advantage.\n\nI never can suppose that such patents as these were originally granted\nwith the view of being a job for the interest of a particular person, to\nthe damage of the public: Whatever profit must arise to the patentee was\nsurely meant at best but as a secondary motive, and since somebody must\nbe a gainer, the choice of the person was made either by favour, or\n_something else_[7] or by the pretence of merit and honesty. This\nargument returns so often and strongly into my head, that I cannot\nforbear frequently repeating it. Surely His Majesty, when he consented\nto the passing of this patent, conceived he was doing an act of grace to\nhis most loyal subjects of Ireland, without any regard to Mr. Wood,\nfarther than as an instrument. But the people of Ireland think this\npatent (intended _no doubt_ for their good) to be a most intolerable\ngrievance, and therefore Mr. Wood can never succeed, without an open\navowal that his profit is preferred not only before the interests, but\nthe very safety and being of a great kingdom; and a kingdom\ndistinguished for its loyalty, perhaps above all others upon earth. Not\nturned from its duty by the \"jurisdiction of the House of Lords,\nabolished at a stroke, by the hardships of the Act of Navigation newly\nenforced; By all possible obstructions in trade,\" and by a hundred\nother instances, \"enough to fill this paper.\" Nor was there ever among\nus the least attempt towards an insurrection in favour of the Pretender.\nTherefore whatever justice a free people can claim we have at least an\nequal title to it with our brethren in England, and whatever grace a\ngood prince can bestow on the most loyal subjects, we have reason to\nexpect it: Neither hath this kingdom any way deserved to be sacrificed\nto one \"single, rapacious, obscure, ignominious projector.\"\n\n[Footnote 7: A hint at the Duchess of Kendal's influence in the\nprocuring of the patent. [T.S.]]\n\nAmong other clauses mentioned in this patent, to shew how advantageous\nit is to Ireland, there is one which seems to be of a singular nature,\nthat the patentee shall be obliged, during his term, \"to pay eight\nhundred pounds a year to the crown, and two hundred pounds a year to the\ncomptroller.\"[8] I have heard indeed that the King's council do always\nconsider, in the passing of a patent, whether it will be of advantage to\nthe crown, but I have likewise heard that it is at the same time\nconsidered whether the passing of it may be injurious to any other\npersons or bodies politic. However, although the attorney and solicitor\nbe servants to the King, and therefore bound to consult His Majesty's\ninterest, yet I am under some doubt whether eight hundred pounds a year\nto the crown would be equivalent to the ruin of a kingdom. It would be\nfar better for us to have paid eight thousand pounds a year into His\nMajesty's coffers, in the midst of all our taxes (which, in proportion,\nare greater in this kingdom than ever they were in England, even during\nthe war) than purchase such an addition to the revenue at the price of\nour _utter undoing_.\n\n[Footnote 8: By the terms of the patent, Wood covenanted to pay to the\nKing's clerk, or comptroller of the coinage, £200 yearly, and £100 per\nannum into his Majesty's exchequer, and not as Walpole's report has it,\n£800 and £200. [T.S.]]\n\nBut here it is plain that fourteen thousand pounds are to be paid by\nWood, only as a small circumstantial charge for the purchase of his\npatent, what were his other visible costs I know not, and what were his\nlatent, is variously conjectured. But he must be surely a man of some\nwonderful merit. Hath he saved any other kingdom at his own expense, to\ngive him a title of reimbursing himself by the destruction of ours? Hath\nhe discovered the longitude or the universal medicine? No. But he hath\nfound out the philosopher's stone after a new manner, by debasing of\ncopper, and resolving to force it upon us for gold.\n\nWhen the two Houses represented to His Majesty, that this patent to Wood\nwas obtained in a clandestine manner, surely the Committee could not\nthink the Parliament would insinuate that it had not passed in the\ncommon forms, and run through every office where fees and perquisites\nwere due. They knew very well that persons in places were no enemies to\ngrants, and that the officers of the crown could not be kept in the\ndark. But the late Lord Lieutenant of Ireland[9] affirmed it was a\nsecret to him (and who will doubt of his veracity, especially when he\nswore to a person of quality; from whom I had it, that Ireland should\nnever be troubled with these halfpence). It was a secret to the people\nof Ireland, who were to be the only sufferers, and those who best knew\nthe state of the kingdom and were most able to advise in such an affair,\nwere wholly strangers to it.\n\n[Footnote 9: The Duke of Grafton. Walpole called him \"a fair-weather\npilot, that knew not what he had to do, when the first storm arose.\"\nCharles, second Duke of Grafton (1683-1757), was the grandfather of the\nthird duke, so virulently attacked by Junius in his famous letters. [T.\nS.]]\n\nIt is allowed by the Report that this patent was passed without the\nknowledge of the chief governor or officers of Ireland; and it is there\nelaborately shewn, that \"former patents have passed in the same manner,\nand are good in law.\" I shall not dispute the legality of patents, but\nam ready to suppose it in His Majesty's power to grant a patent for\nstamping round bits of copper to every subject he hath. Therefore to lay\naside the point of law, I would only put the question, whether in reason\nand justice it would not have been proper, in an affair upon which the\nwelfare of a kingdom depends, that the said kingdom should have received\ntimely notice, and the matter not be carried on between the patentee and\nthe officers of the Crown, who were to be the only gainers by it.\n\nThe Parliament, who in matters of this nature are the most able and\nfaithful counsellors, did represent this grant to be \"destructive of\ntrade, and dangerous to the properties of the people,\" to which the only\nanswer is, that \"the King hath a prerogative to make such a grant.\"\n\nIt is asserted that in the patent to Knox, his \"halfpence, are made and\ndeclared the current coin of the kingdom,\" whereas in this to Wood,\nthere is only a \"power given to issue them to such as will receive\nthem.\" The authors of the Report, I think, do not affirm that the King\ncan by law declare _anything_ to be current money by his\nletters-patents. I dare say they will not affirm it, and if Knox's\npatent contained in it powers contrary to law, why is it mentioned as a\nprecedent in His Majesty's just and merciful reign:[10] But although\nthat clause be not in Wood's patent, yet possibly there are others, the\nlegality whereof may be equally doubted, and particularly that, whereby\n\"a power is given to William Wood to break into houses in search of any\ncoin made in imitation of his.\" This may perhaps be affirmed to be\nillegal and dangerous to the liberty of the subject. Yet this is a\nprecedent taken from Knox's patent, where the same power is granted, and\nis a strong instance what uses may be sometimes made of precedents.\n\n[Footnote 10: Knox's patent, as Monck Mason points out, did not contain\nthe right to have his coins pass as the current coin of the realm; that\nwas permitted by a proclamation of the lord lieutenant, and could in the\nsame manner be withdrawn. Knox's patent differed materially from that\ngranted to Wood, since he was obliged to take back his coins and give\ngold or silver for them, and no one was compelled to take more than five\nshillings in the payment of each £100. See note, p. 66. [T.S.]]\n\nBut although before the passing of this patent, it was not thought\nnecessary to consult any persons of this kingdom, or make the least\nenquiry whether copper money were wanted among us; yet now at length,\nwhen the matter is over, when the patent hath long passed, when Wood\nhath already coined seventeen thousand pounds, and hath his tools and\nimplements prepared to coin six times as much more; the Committee hath\nbeen pleased to make this affair the subject of enquiry. Wood is\npermitted to produce his evidences, which consist as I have already\nobserved, of four in number, whereof Coleby, Brown and Mr. Finley the\nbanker are three. And these were to prove that copper money was\nextremely wanted in Ireland. The first had been out of the kingdom\nalmost twenty years, from the time that he was tried for robbing the\ntreasury, and therefore his knowledge and credibility are equal. The\nsecond may be allowed a more knowing witness, because I think it is not\nabove a year since the House of Commons ordered the Attorney-general to\nprosecute him, for endeavouring \"to take away the life of John Bingham\nEsq; member of parliaments by perjury and subornation.\" He asserted that\nhe was forced to tally with his labourers for want of small money (which\nhath often been practised in England by Sir Ambrose Crawley[11] and\nothers) but those who knew him better give a different reason, (if there\nbe any truth at all in the fact) that he was forced to tally with his\nlabourers not for want of halfpence, but of more substantial money,\nwhich is highly possible, because the race of suborners, forgers,\nperjurers and ravishers, are usually people of no fortune, or of those\nwho have run it out by their vices and profuseness. Mr. Finley the third\nwitness honestly confessed, that he was ignorant whether Ireland wanted\ncopper money or no; but all his intention was to buy a certain quantity\nfrom Wood at a large discount, and sell them as well as he could, by\nwhich he hoped to get two or three thousand pounds for himself.\n\n[Footnote 11: Ambrose Crowley (not Crawley) was alderman and sheriff of\nLondon. He was knighted January 1st, 1706-1707, and sat in the House of\nCommons as member for Andover in 1713-1714. [T.S.]]\n\nBut suppose there were not one single halfpenny of copper coin in this\nwhole kingdom (which Mr. Wood seems to intend, unless we will come to\nhis terms, as appears by employing his emissaries to buy up our old ones\nat a penny in the shilling more than they pass for), it could not be any\nreal evil to us, although it might be some inconvenience. We have many\nsorts of small silver coins, to which they are strangers in England,\nsuch as the French threepences, fourpence halfpennies and eightpence\nhalf-pennies, the Scotch fivepences and tenpences, besides their\ntwenty-pences, and three-and-four-pences, by all which we are able to\nmake change to a halfpenny of almost any piece of gold or silver, and if\nwe are driven to Brown's expedient of a sealed card, with the little\ngold or silver still remaining, it will I suppose, be somewhat better\nthan to have nothing left but Wood's adulterated copper, which he is\nneither obliged by his patent, nor hitherto able by his estate to make\ngood.\n\nThe Report farther tells us, it \"must be admitted that letters-patents\nunder the Great Seal of Great Britain for coining copper money for\nIreland are legal and obligatory, a just and reasonable exercise of His\nMajesty's royal prerogative, and in no manner derogatory or invasive of\nany liberty or privilege of his subjects of Ireland.\" First we desire to\nknow, why His Majesty's prerogative might not have been as well\nasserted, by passing this patent in Ireland, and subjecting the several\nconditions of the contract to the inspection of those who are only\nconcerned, as was formerly done in the only precedents for patents\ngranted for coining for this kingdom, since the mixed money[12] in Queen\nElizabeth's time, during the difficulties of a rebellion: Whereas now\nupon the greatest imposition that can possibly be practised, we must go\nto England with our complaints, where it hath been for some time the\nfashion to think and to affirm that \"we cannot be too hardly used.\"\nAgain the Report says, that \"such patents are obligatory.\" After long\nthinking, I am not able to find out what can possibly be meant here by\nthis word _obligatory_. This patent of Wood neither obligeth him to\nutter his coin, nor us to take it, or if it did the latter, it would be\nso far void, because no patent can oblige the subject against law,\nunless an illegal patent passed in one kingdom can bind another and not\nitself.\n\n[Footnote 12: \"Civill warre having set all Ireland in a combustion, the\nQueene [Elizabeth] more easily to subdue the rebels, did take silver\ncoyne from the Irish, some few years before her death, and paid her army\nwith a mixed base coyne, which, by proclamation, was commanded to be\nspent and received, for sterling silver money. This base mixed money had\nthree parts of copper, and the fourth part of silver, which proportion\nof silver was in some part consumed by the mixture, so as the English\ngoldsmiths valued a shilling thereof at no more than two silver pence,\nthough they acknowledged the same to be worth two pence halfpenny.\"\n(Fynes Moryson's \"Itinerary,\" pt. i., p. 283). [T.S.]]\n\nLastly, it is added that \"such patents are in no manner derogatory or\ninvasive of any liberty or privilege of the King's subjects of Ireland.\"\nIf this proposition be true, as it is here laid down, without any\nlimitation either expressed or implied, it must follow that a King of\nEngland may at any time coin copper money for Ireland, and oblige his\nsubjects here to take a piece of copper under the value of half a\nfarthing for half-a-crown, as was practised by the late King James, and\neven without that arbitrary prince's excuse, from the necessity and\nexigences of his affairs. If this be in no manner \"derogatory nor\nevasive of any liberties or privileges of the subjects of Ireland,\" it\nought to have been expressed what our liberties and privileges are, and\nwhether we have any at all, for in specifying the word _Ireland_,\ninstead of saying \"His Majesty's subjects,\" it would seem to insinuate\nthat we are not upon the same foot with our fellow-subjects in\n_England_; which, however the practice may have been, I hope will never\nbe directly asserted, for I do not understand that Poining's act[13]\ndeprived us of our liberty, but only changed the manner of passing laws\nhere (which however was a power most indirectly obtained) by leaving the\nnegative to the two Houses of Parliament. But, waiving all controversies\nrelating to the legislature, no person, I believe, was ever yet so bold\nas to affirm that the people of Ireland have not the same title to the\nbenefits of the common law, with the rest of His Majesty's subjects, and\ntherefore whatever liberties or privileges the people of England enjoy\nby common law, we of Ireland have the same; so that in my humble\nopinion, the word _Ireland_ standing in that proposition, was, in the\nmildest interpretation, _a lapse of the pen_.\n\n[Footnote 13: It was not intended that Poyning's act should interfere\nwith the liberty of the people, but it is undoubted that advantage was\ntaken of this law, and an interpretation put on it far different from\nthe intention that brought it on the statute books. It was passed by a\nparliament convened by Sir Edward Poyning, at Drogheda, in the tenth\nyear of Henry VII.'s reign. Its immediate cause was the invasion of\nPerkin Warbeck. That pretender assumed royal authority in Ireland and\nhad several statutes passed during his short-lived term of power. To\nprevent any viceroy from arrogating to himself the powers of law-making\nit was enacted by Poyning's parliament:\n\n\"That no parliament be holden hereafter in Ireland, but at such season\nas the King's lieutenant and counsaile there first do certifie the King,\nunder the Great Seal of that land, the causes and considerations, and\nall such acts as them seemeth should pass in the same parliament, and\nsuch causes, considerations, and acts affirmed by the King and his\ncounsaile to be good and expedient for that land, and his licence\nthereupon, as well in affirmation of the said causes and acts, as to\nsummon the said parliament, under his Great Seal of England had and\nobtained; that done, a parliament to be had and holden as afore\nrehearsed\" (\"Irish Statutes,\" vol. i., p. 44).\n\nTwo statutes, one, the Act of 3 and 4 Phil., and Mary, cap. 4, and the\nother of II Eliz. Ses. 3, cap. 8, explain this act further, and the\nlatter points out the reason for the original enactment, namely, that\n\"before this statute, when liberty was given to the governors to call\nparliaments at their pleasure, acts passed as well to the dishonour of\nthe prince, as to the hindrance of their subjects\" (\"Irish Statutes,\"\nvol. i., p. 346).\n\n\"By Poyning's Law,\" says Lecky, \"a great part of the independence of\nthe Irish Parliament had indeed been surrendered; but even the servile\nParliament which passed it, though extending by its own authority to\nIreland laws previously enacted in England, never admitted the right of\nthe English Parliament to make laws for Ireland.\" (\"Hist. Ireland,\" vol.\nii., p. 154; 1892 ed). [T.S.]]\n\nThe Report farther asserts, that \"the precedents are many, wherein cases\nof great importance to Ireland, and that immediately affected the\ninterests of that kingdom, warrants, orders, and directions by the\nauthority of the King and his predecessors, have been issued under the\nroyal sign manual, without any previous reference or advice of His\nMajesty's officers of Ireland, which have always had their due force,\nand have been punctually complied with, and obeyed.\" It may be so, and I\nam heartily sorry for it, because it may prove an eternal source of\ndiscontent. However among all these precedents there is not one of a\npatent for coining money for Ireland.\n\nThere is nothing hath perplexed me more than this doctrine of\nprecedents. If a job is to be done, and upon searching records you find\nit hath been done before, there will not want a lawyer to justify the\nlegality of it, by producing his precedents, without ever considering\nthe motives and circumstances that first introduced them, the necessity\nor turbulence or iniquity of times, the corruptions of ministers, or the\narbitrary disposition of the prince then reigning. And I have been told\nby persons eminent in the law, that the worst actions which human nature\nis capable of, may be justified by the same doctrine. How the first\nprecedents began of determining cases of the highest importance to\nIreland, and immediately affecting its interest, without any previous\nreference or advice to the King's officers here, may soon be accounted\nfor. Before this kingdom was entirely reduced by the submission of\nTyrone in the last year of Queen Elizabeth's reign, there was a period\nof four hundred years, which was a various scene of war and peace\nbetween the English pale and the Irish natives, and the government of\nthat part of this island which lay in the English hands, was, in many\nthings under the immediate administration of the King. Silver and copper\nwere often coined here among us, and once at least upon great necessity,\na mixed or base metal was sent from England. The reign of King James\nIst. was employed in settling the kingdom after Tyrone's rebellion, and\nthis nation flourished extremely till the time of the massacre 1641. In\nthat difficult juncture of affairs, the nobility and gentry coined their\nown plate here in Dublin.\n\nBy all that I can discover, the copper coin of Ireland for three hundred\nyears past consisted of small pence and halfpence, which particular men\nhad licence to coin, and were current only within certain towns and\ndistricts, according to the personal credit of the owner who uttered\nthem, and was bound to receive them again, whereof I have seen many\nsorts; neither have I heard of any patent granted for coining copper for\nIreland till the reign of King Charles II. which was in the year 1680.\nto George Legge Lord Dartmouth, and renewed by King James II. in the\nfirst year of his reign to John Knox. Both patents were passed in\nIreland, and in both the patentees were obliged to receive their coin\nagain to any that would offer then twenty shillings of it, for which\nthey were obliged to pay gold or silver.\n\nThe patents both of Lord Dartmouth and Knox were referred to the\nAttorney-general here, and a report made accordingly, and both, as I\nhave already said, were passed in this kingdom. Knox had only a patent\nfor the remainder of the term granted to Lord Dartmouth, the patent\nexpired in 1701, and upon a petition by Roger Moor to have it renewed,\nthe matter was referred hither, and upon the report of the attorney and\nsolicitor, that it was not for His Majesty's service or the interest of\nthe nation to have it renewed, it was rejected by King William. It\nshould therefore seem very extraordinary, that a patent for coining\ncopper halfpence, intended and professed for the good of the kingdom,\nshould be passed without once consulting that kingdom, for the good of\nwhich it is declared to be intended, and this upon the application of a\n\"poor, private obscure mechanic;\" and a patent of such a nature, that as\nsoon as ever the kingdom is informed of its being passed, they cry out\nunanimously against it as ruinous and destructive. The representative\nof the nation in Parliament, and the Privy-council address the King to\nhave it recalled; yet the patentee, such a one as I have described,\nshall prevail to have this patent approved, and his private interest\nshall weigh down the application of a whole kingdom. St. Paul says, \"All\nthings are lawful, but all things are not expedient.\" We are answered\nthat this patent is lawful, but is it expedient? We read that the\nhigh-priest said \"It was expedient that one Man should die for the\npeople;\" and this was a most wicked proposition. But that a whole nation\nshould die for one man, was never heard of before.\n\nBut because much weight is laid on the precedents of other patents, for\ncoining copper for Ireland, I will set this matter in as clear a light\nas I can. Whoever hath read the Report, will be apt to think, that a\ndozen precedents at least could be produced of copper coined for\nIreland, by virtue of patents passed in England, and that the coinage\nwas there too; whereas I am confident, there cannot be one precedent\nshewn of a patent passed in England for coining copper for Ireland, for\nabove an hundred years past, and if there were any before, it must be in\ntimes of confusion. The only patents I could ever hear of, are those\nalready mentioned to Lord Dartmouth and Knox; the former in 1680. and\nthe latter in 1685. Now let us compare these patents with that granted\nto Wood. First, the patent to Knox, which was under the same conditions\nas that granted to Lord Dartmouth, was passed in Ireland, the government\nand the Attorney and Solicitor-general making report that it would be\nuseful to this kingdom: [The patentee was obliged to make every\nhalfpenny one hundred and ten grains Troy weight, whereby _2s. 2d_. only\ncould be coined out of a pound of copper.][14] The patent was passed\nwith the advice of the King's council here; The patentee was obliged to\nreceive his coin from those who thought themselves surcharged, and to\ngive gold and silver for it; Lastly, The patentee was to pay only _16l.\n13s. 4d. per ann._ to the crown. Then, as to the execution of that\npatent. First, I find the halfpence were milled, which, as it is of\ngreat use to prevent counterfeits (and therefore industriously avoided\nby Wood) so it was an addition to the charge of coinage. And for the\nweight and goodness of the metal; I have several halfpence now by me,\nmany of which weigh a ninth part more than those coined by Wood, and\nbear the fire and hammer a great deal better; and which is no trifle,\nthe impression fairer and deeper. I grant indeed, that many of the\nlatter coinage yield in weight to some of Wood's, by a fraud natural to\nsuch patentees; but not so immediately after the grant, and before the\ncoin grew current: For in this circumstance Mr. Wood must serve for a\nprecedent in future times.\n\n[Footnote 14: The portion here in square brackets was printed in the\nfourth edition of this Letter and in the work entitled, \"Fraud\nDetected.\" It is not given in Faulkner's first collected edition issued\nin 1735, nor in \"The Hibernian Patriot,\" issued in 1730. [T.S.]]\n\n\nLet us now examine this new patent granted to William Wood. It passed\nupon very false suggestions of his own, and of a few confederates: It\npassed in England, without the least reference hither. It passed unknown\nto the very Lord Lieutenant, then in England. Wood is empowered to coin\none hundred and eight thousand pounds, \"and all the officers in the\nkingdom (civil and military) are commanded\" in the Report to countenance\nand assist him. Knox had only power to utter what we would take, and was\nobliged \"to receive his coin back again at our demand,\" and to \"enter\ninto security for so doing.\" Wood's halfpence are not milled, and\ntherefore more easily counterfeited by himself as well as by others:\nWood pays a thousand pounds _per ann._ for 14 years, Knox paid only\n_16l. 13s. 4d. per ann._ for 21 years.\n\nIt was the Report that set me the example of making a comparison between\nthose two patents, wherein the committee was grossly misled by the false\nrepresentation of William Wood, as it was by another assertion, that\nseven hundred ton of copper were coined during the 21 years of Lord\nDartmouth's and Knox's patents. Such a quantity of copper at the rate of\n_2s. 8d. per_ pound would amount to about an hundred and ninety thousand\npounds, which was very near as much as the current cash of the kingdom\nin those days; yet, during that period, Ireland was never known to have\ntoo much copper coin, and for several years there was no coining at all:\nBesides I am assured, that upon enquiring into the custom-house books,\nall the copper imported into the kingdom, from 1683 to 1692, which\nincludes 8 years of the 21 (besides one year allowed for the troubles)\ndid not exceed 47 tons, and we cannot suppose even that small quantity\nto have been wholly applied to coinage: So that I believe there was\nnever any comparison more unluckily made or so destructive of the design\nfor which it was produced.\n\nThe Psalmist reckons it an effect of God's anger, when \"He selleth His\npeople for nought, and taketh no money for them.\" That we have greatly\noffended God by the wickedness of our lives is not to be disputed: But\nour King we have not offended in word or deed; and although he be God's\nvicegerent upon earth, he will not punish us for any offences, except\nthose which we shall commit against his legal authority, his sacred\nperson (which God preserve) or the laws of the land.\n\nThe Report is very profuse in arguments, that Ireland is in great want\nof copper money.[15] Who were the witnesses to prove it, hath been shewn\nalready, but in the name of God, Who are to be judges? Does not the\nnation best know its own wants? Both Houses of Parliament, the\nPrivy-council and the whole body of the people declare the contrary: Or\nlet the wants be what they will, We desire they may not be supplied by\nMr. Wood. We know our own wants but too well; they are many and grievous\nto be borne, but quite of another kind. Let England be satisfied: As\nthings go, they will in a short time have all our gold and silver, and\nmay keep their adulterate copper at home, for we are determined not to\npurchase it with our manufactures, which Wood hath graciously offered to\naccept. Our wants are not so bad by an hundredth part as the method he\nhath taken to supply them. He hath already tried his faculty in\nNew-England,[16] and I hope he will meet at least with an equal\nreception here; what _that_ was I leave to public intelligence. I am\nsupposing a wild case, that if there should be any person already\nreceiving a monstrous pension out of this kingdom, who was instrumental\nin procuring this patent, they have either not well consulted their own\ninterests, or Wood must[17] put more dross into his copper and still\ndiminish its weight.\n\n[Footnote 15: On this subject of the want of small money in Ireland,\nMonck Mason traverses the Report in the following manner:\n\n\"There appears to be a manifest prevarication in their lordships' report\nupon this part of the subject; they state, that the witnesses testified,\nthat there was a want of small money in Ireland; they attempt,\ntherefore, to impose a copper currency, which certainly was not wanted.\nTo satisfy the reader upon this point, I shall quote, from the\nunpublished correspondence of Archbishop King, the following extracts:\nthe first, from his letter to General Gorge, dated the 17th October,\n1724, is to the following purpose.\n\n\"'... As to our wanting halfpence for change, it is most false; we have\nmore halfpence than we need, already; it is true, we want change; but it\nis sixpences, shillings, half-crowns, and crowns; our silver and our\nguineas being almost gone; and the general current coin of the kingdom\nis now moydores, which are thirty shillings a-piece; at least nine pence\nabove the value in silver: now, they would have us change these for\nhalfpence, and so the whole cash of the kingdom would be these\nhalfpence.' ...\n\n\"But the true state of the case, as to coin, is more circumstantially\ndeveloped in the following letter of the same prelate to Mr. Southwell,\nwhich was written a few months before, viz., on the 9th June, 1724.\n\n\"'... And yet, after all, we want change, and I will take leave to\nacquaint you with the state of this kingdom as to coin. We used to have\nhardly any money passing here, but foreign ducatoons, plate pieces,\nperns, dollars, etc. but, when the East India Company were forbid\nsending the coin of England abroad, they continued to buy up all our\nforeign coin, and give us English money in lieu of some part of it; by\nwhich we lost twopence in every ounce, the consequence of this was, that\nin two years there was not to be seen in Ireland a piece of foreign\nsilver.\n\n\"'If any be brought, it is immediately sent away, the two, or as I am\ninformed, the three pence in the ounce, given by the East India Company,\nbeing a temptation not to be resisted; but, the truth is, very little is\nbrought in, for the merchants that carry our commodities to foreign\nmarkets, find it more to their advantage to carry directly to London\nwhatever they receive in cash; and whereas formerly they used, when they\nhad disposed of their cargo, to load their vessels with such commodities\nas there was a demand for in Ireland, and bring the rest in cash, they\nbring now only the commodities, and send the silver to London; and when\nthey have got the twopence in every ounce from the East India Company,\nthe rest serves to answer the returns we are obliged to make to England,\nfor the rents we are obliged to pay to noblemen and gentlemen who have\nestates in Ireland and live in England, and for the pensions, and other\noccasions which are many; by this means they gain likewise the exchange,\nwhich is commonly four or five per cent, better to them than if they\nsent cash.\n\n\"'It Is farther to be observed, that 21 shillings, which is the value of\na guinea in England, makes in Ireland 22 shillings and 9 pence, whereas\na guinea passes for 23 shillings with us, therefore, he who sends silver\ninto England, gains three pence more by it than if he sent guineas; this\nadvantage, though it may seem little, yet in a manner has entirely\ndrained us of our English money which was given in lieu of foreign\nsilver.\n\n\"'But farther, if any carry foreign gold to England, they cannot easily\npass it, and if they do, it is at a greater loss than there is in the\nguineas, this has taken away our guineas, so that there is hardly one to\nbe seen; we have hardly any coin left but a few moydores and pistoles,\nwhich can, by no means, serve the inland trade of the kingdom.\n\n\"'To give, therefore, a short view of our case, it is thus; We can have\nEnglish coin but by stealth, there being an act of parliament forbidding\nthe exportation of English coin; if, therefore, we should send our gold\nor silver to England to be coined, we cannot have it back again, or if\nwe could, we cannot keep it for the reason above; we cannot for the same\nreason have foreign silver; let us add to these, that by the act of\nnavigation and other acts, we cannot make our markets of buying where we\nmake our markets for selling; though we might have the commodities we\nwant much cheaper there, than we can have them in England, viz. all East\nIndia and Turkey goods, with many others: nor is it to be expected that\nany nation will trade with us with their silver only, when we will not\nexchange commodities with them.\n\n\"'Except, therefore, England designs entirely to ruin Ireland, a kingdom\nby which it is demonstrable that she gains yearly thirteen or fourteen\nhundred thousand pounds, she ought to think of giving us some relief'\"\n(\"History of St. Patrick's,\" pp. xciii-xciv). [T.S.]]\n\n[Footnote 16: See note on p. 14. [T.S.]]\n\n[Footnote 17: Another hint at the Duchess of Kendal and her connection\nwith the patent. [T.S.]]\n\nUpon Wood's complaint that the officers of the King's revenue here had\nalready given orders to all the inferior officers not to receive any\nof his coin, the Report says, That \"this cannot but be looked upon as a\nvery extraordinary proceeding,\" and being contrary to the powers given\nin the patent, the Committee say, They \"cannot advise His Majesty to\ngive directions to the officers of the revenue here, not to receive or\nutter any of the said coin as has been desired in the addresses of both\nHouses,\" but on the contrary, they \"think it both just and reasonable\nthat the King should immediately give orders to the commissioners of the\nrevenue, &c. to revoke all orders, &c. that may have been given by them\nto hinder or obstruct the receiving the said coin.\" And accordingly, we\nare told, such orders are arrived.[18]. Now this was a cast of Wood's\npolitics; for his information was wholly false and groundless, which he\nknew very well; and that the commissioners of the revenue here were\nall, except one, sent us from England, and love their employments too\nwell to have taken such a step: But Wood was wise enough to consider,\nthat such orders of revocation would be an open declaration of the crown\nin his favour, would put the government here under a difficulty, would\nmake a noise, and possibly create some terror in the poor people of\nIreland. And one great point he hath gained, that although any orders of\nrevocation will be needless, yet a new order is to be sent, and perhaps\nalready here, to the commissioners of the revenue, and all the King's\nofficers in Ireland, that Wood's \"halfpence be suffered and permitted,\nwithout any let, suit, trouble, molestation or denial of any of the\nKing's officers or ministers whatsoever, to pass and be received as\ncurrent money by such as shall be willing to receive them.\" In this\norder there is no exception, and therefore, as far as I can judge, it\nincludes all officers both civil and military, from the Lord High\nChancellor to a justice of peace, and from the general to an ensign: So\nthat Wood's project is not likely to fail for want of managers enough.\nFor my own part, as things stand, I have but little regret to find\nmyself out of the number, and therefore I shall continue in all humility\nto exhort and warn my fellow-subjects never to receive or utter this\ncoin, which will reduce the kingdom to beggary by much quicker and\nlarger steps than have hitherto been taken.[19]\n\n[Footnote 18: Archbishop King's letter, quoted by Monck Mason, explains\nwhy it was that the revenue officers refused to receive Wood's coins. It\nseems the officers had been advised by lawyers that, in the event of\ntheir taking the coins, it might be quite likely they would be compelled\nto make them good, should such a demand be made of them. Precedents\ncould easily be cited by those taking action, since all previous patents\nissued to private individuals for coining money, required of the\npatentee to take them back and pay for them with gold or silver. [T.\nS.]]\n\n[Footnote 19: The suggestion thus made by the Lords of the Committee,\nalthough coupled with the reduction in the amount of money Wood was to\nbe permitted to introduce, did not do any good. Archbishop King argued\nrightly that this was treating the people of Ireland as if they were\nfools and children. If Wood could coin £40,000, what was to prevent him\ncoining £200,000? The suggestion indeed irritated the people almost as\nmuch as did the patent itself. [T.S.]]\n\nBut it is needless to argue any longer. The matter is come to an issue.\nHis Majesty pursuant to the law, hath left the field open between Wood\nand the kingdom of Ireland. Wood hath liberty to offer his coin, and we\nhave law, reason, liberty and necessity to refuse it. A knavish jockey\nmay ride an old foundered jade about the market, but none are obliged to\nbuy it. I hope the words \"voluntary\" and \"willing to receive it\" will be\nunderstood, and applied in their true natural meaning, as commonly\nunderstood by Protestants. For if a fierce captain comes to my shop to\nbuy six yards of scarlet cloth, followed by a porter laden with a sack\nof Wood's coin upon his shoulders, if we are agreed about the price, and\nmy scarlet lies ready cut upon the counter, if he then gives me the word\nof command, to receive my money in Wood's coin, and calls me a\n\"disaffected Jacobite dog\" for refusing it (although I am as loyal a\nsubject as himself, and without hire) and thereupon seizes my cloth,\nleaving me the price in his odious copper, and bids me take my remedy:\nIn this case, I shall hardly be brought to think that I am left to my\nown will. I shall therefore on such occasions, first order the porter\naforesaid to go off with his pack, and then see the money in silver and\ngold in my possession before I cut or measure my cloth. But if a common\nsoldier drinks his pot first, and then offers payment in Wood's\nhalfpence, the landlady may be under some difficulty; For if she\ncomplains to his captain or ensign, they are likewise officers, included\nin this general order for encouraging these halfpence to pass as current\nmoney. If she goes to a justice of peace, he is also an officer, to whom\nthis general order is directed. I do therefore advise her to follow my\npractice, which I have already begun, and be paid for her goods before\nshe parts with them. However I should have been content, for some\nreasons, that the military gentlemen had been excepted by name, because\nI have heard it said, that their discipline is best confined within\ntheir own district.\n\nHis Majesty in the conclusion of his answer to the address of the House\nof Lords against Wood's coin, is pleased to say that \"he will do\neverything in his power for the satisfaction of his people.\" It should\nseem therefore, that the recalling the patent is not to be understood as\na thing in his power. But however since the law does not oblige us to\nreceive this coin, and consequently the patent leaves it to our\nvoluntary choice, there is nothing remaining to preserve us from rain\nbut that the whole kingdom should continue in a firm determinate\nresolution never to receive or utter this fatal coin:[20]\n\n[Footnote 20: So ready was the response to this suggestion of Swift's,\nthat it was found necessary for tradesmen to take precautions to have it\npublicly known that they were in no way connected with Wood and his\nmoney, The following is a copy of an advertisement which illustrates\nthis:\n\n\"Whereas several persons in this kingdom suspect that John Molyneux of\nMeath Street, ironmonger, and his brother Daniel Molyneux, of Essex\nStreet, ironmonger, are interested in the patent obtained by William\nWood for coining of halfpence and farthings for this kingdom.\n\n\"Now we the said John Molyneux and Daniel Molyneux, in order to satisfy\nthe public, do hereby declare, that we are in no way concerned with the\nsaid Wood in relation to his said patent; And that we never were\npossessed of any of the said halfpence or farthings, except one\nhalfpence and one farthing, which I the said John Molyneux received in a\npost-letter, and which I immediately afterwards delivered to one of the\nLords-Justices of Ireland.\n\n\"And we do further declare, that we will not directly or indirectly, be\nanyways concerned with the said Wood's halfpence or farthings; but on\nthe contrary, act to the great advantage and satisfaction of this\nkingdom, as good, loving and faithful subjects ought to do.

HANDY.\n\n\"Dublin, 29th. August, 1724.\" [T.S.]]\n\nAfter which, let the officers to whom these orders are directed, (I\nwould willingly except the military) come with their exhortations,\ntheir arguments and their eloquence, to persuade us to find our interest\nin our undoing. Let Wood and his accomplices travel about the country\nwith cart-loads of their ware, and see who will take it off their hands,\nthere will be no fear of his being robbed, for a highwayman would scorn\nto touch it.\n\nI am only in pain how the commissioners of the revenue will proceed in\nthis juncture; because I am told they are obliged by act of Parliament\nto take nothing but gold and silver in payment for His Majesty's\ncustoms, and I think they cannot justly offer this coinage of Mr. Wood\nto others, unless they will be content to receive it themselves.\n\nThe sum of the whole is this. The \"Committee advises the King to send\nimmediate orders to all his officers here, that Wood's coin be suffered\nand permitted without any let, suit, trouble, &c. to pass and be\nreceived as current money by such as shall be willing to receive the\nsame.\" It is probable, that the first willing receivers may be those who\nmust receive it whether they will or no, at least under the penalty of\nlosing an office. But the landed undepending men, the merchants, the\nshopkeepers and bulk of the people, I hope, and am almost confident,\nwill never receive it. What must the consequence be? The owners will\nsell it for as much as they can get. Wood's halfpence will come to be\noffered for six a penny (yet then he will be a sufficient gainer) and\nthe necessary receivers will be losers of two-thirds in their salaries\nor pay.\n\nThis puts me in mind of a passage I was told many years ago in England.\nAt a quarter-sessions in Leicester, the justices had wisely decreed, to\ntake off a halfpenny in a quart from the price of ale. One of them, who\ncame in after the thing was determined, being informed of what had\npassed, said thus: \"Gentlemen; you have made an order, that ale should\nbe sold in our country for three halfpence a quart: I desire you will\nnow make another to appoint who must drink it, for _by G-- I will\nnot_.\"[21]\n\n[Footnote 21: The following broadside, ascribed to Swift, but written\nprobably by Sheridan, further amusingly illustrates the point Swift\nmakes. The broadside was printed by John Harding:\n\n\"Another Letter to Mr. Harding the printer, upon occasion of the Report\nof the Committee of the Lords of His Majesty's Most Honourable\nPrivy-Council, in relation to Mr. Wood's halfpence and farthings, etc.,\nlately published.\n\n\"Mr. Harding,--Although this letter also is directed to you, yet you\nknow that it is intended for the benefit of the whole kingdom, and\ntherefore I pray make it public, and take care to disperse it.\n\n\"The design of it is only to desire all people to take notice, That\nwhatever apprehensions some persons seem to be under on account of the\nabove-mentioned report concerning Mr. Wood's halfpence and farthings,\nyet the utmost advice which the right honourable Committee have thought\nfit to give His Majesty, is, That a certain sum of the said halfpence\nand farthings may be received as current money by such as shall be\nwilling to receive the same. And if we are willing to ruin ourselves and\nour country, I think we are not to be pitied.\n\n\"Upon this occasion I would only tell my countrymen a short story.\n\n\"A certain King of Great Britain who spoke broad Scotch, and being\nhimself a man of wit, loved both to hear and speak things that were\nhumorous, had once a petition preferred to him, in which the petitioner,\nhaving set forth his own merits, most humbly prayed His Majesty to grant\nhim letters-patent for receiving a shilling from every one of his\nsubjects who should be willing to give so much to him. 'In gude troth,'\nsaid the King, 'a very reasonable petition. Let every man give thee twa\nshillings gin he be willing so to do, and thou shalt have full liberty\nto receive it.' 'But,' says the petitioner, 'I desire that this clause\nmay be inserted in my patent, That every man who refuses to give me a\nshilling, should appear at Westminster Hall to shew cause why he so\nrefuses.' 'This also,' says the King, 'shall be granted thee, but always\nwith this proviso, that the man be willing to come.'\n\n\"I am your, etc.\n\n\"MISOXULOS.\"]\n\n\nI must beg leave to caution your lordships and worships in one\nparticular. Wood hath graciously promised to load us at present only\nwith forty thousand pounds of his coin, till the exigences of the\nkingdom require the rest. I entreat you will never suffer Mr. Wood to be\na judge of your exigences. While there is one piece of silver or gold\nremaining in the kingdom he will call it an exigency, he will double his\npresent _quantum_ by stealth as soon as he can, and will have the\nremainder still to the good. He will pour his own raps[22]and\ncounterfeits upon us: France and Holland will do the same; nor will our\nown coiners at home be behind them: To confirm which I have now in my\npocket a rap or counterfeit halfpenny in imitation of his, but so ill\nperformed, that in my conscience I believe it is not of his coining.\n\n[Footnote 22: The word Rap is probably a contraction of \"raparee,\" and\nwas the name given to the tokens that passed current in Ireland for\ncopper coins of small value. Generally it referred to debased coins;\nhence it may be allied to \"raparee,\" who might be considered as a\ndebased citizen. The raparees were so called from the rapary or\nhalf-pike they carried. [T.S.]]\n\nI must now desire your lordships and worships that you will give great\nallowance for this long undigested paper, I find myself to have gone\ninto several repetitions, which were the effects of haste, while new\nthoughts fell in to add something to what I had said before. I think I\nmay affirm that I have fully answered every paragraph in the Report,\nwhich although it be not unartfully drawn, and is perfectly in the\nspirit of a pleader who can find the most plausible topics in behalf of\nhis client, yet there was no great skill required to detect the many\nmistakes contained in it, which however are by no means to be charged\nupon the right honourable Committee, but upon the most false impudent\nand fraudulent representations of Wood and his accomplices. I desire one\nparticular may dwell upon your minds, although I have mentioned it more\nthan once; That after all the weight laid upon precedents there is not\none produced in the whole Report, of a patent for coining copper in\nEngland to pass in Ireland, and only two patents referred to (for indeed\nthere were no more) which were both passed in Ireland, by references to\nthe King's Council here, both less advantageous to the coiner than this\nof Wood, and in both securities given to receive the coin at every call,\nand give gold and silver in lieu of it. This demonstrates the most\nflagrant falsehood and impudence of Wood, by which he would endeavour to\nmake the right honourable Committee his instruments, (for his own\nillegal and exorbitant gain,) to ruin a kingdom, which hath deserved\nquite different treatment.\n\nI am very sensible that such a work as I have undertaken might have\nworthily employed a much better pen. But when a house is attempted to be\nrobbed it often happens that the weakest in the family runs first to\nstop the door. All the assistance I had were some informations from an\neminent person,[23] whereof I am afraid I have spoiled a few by\nendeavouring to make them of a piece with my own productions, and the\nrest I was not able to manage: I was in the case of David who could not\nmove in the armour of Saul, and therefore I rather chose to attack this\n\"uncircumcised Philistine (Wood I mean) with a sling and a stone.\" And I\nmay say for Wood's honour as well as my own, that he resembles Goliath\nin many circumstances, very applicable to the present purpose; For\nGoliath had \"a helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a\ncoat of mail, and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of\nbrass, and he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass\nbetween his shoulders.\" In short he was like Mr. Wood, all over brass;\nAnd \"he defied the armies of the living God.\" Goliath's condition of\ncombat were likewise the same with those of Wood. \"If he prevail against\nus, then shall we be his servants:\" But if it happens that I prevail\nover him, I renounce the other part of the condition, he shall never be\na servant of mine, for I do not think him fit to be trusted in any\nhonest man's shop.\n\n[Footnote 23: Mr. Robert Lindsay, a Dublin lawyer, assisted Swift on the\nlegal points raised in the Drapier's letters. This is the Mr. Lindsay,\ncounsellor-at-law, to whom Swift submitted a case concerning a Mr.\nGorman (see Scott's edit., vol. xix., p. 294). Mr. Lindsay is supposed\nto be the author of two letters addressed to Chief Justice Whitshed on\nthe matter of his conduct towards the grand jury which discharged\nHarding the printer (see Scott's edit., vol. vi., p. 467). [T.S.]]\n\nI will conclude with my humble desire and request which I made in my\nsecond letter; That your lordships and worships would please to order a\ndeclaration to be drawn up expressing, in the strongest terms, your firm\nresolutions never to receive or utter any of Wood's halfpence or\nfarthings, and forbidding your tenants to receive them. That the said\ndeclaration may be signed by as many persons as possible who have\nestates in this kingdom, and be sent down to your several tenants\naforesaid.[24]\n\n[Footnote 24: A Declaration, pursuant to this request, was signed soon\nafter by the most considerable persons of the kingdom, which was\nuniversally spread and of great use. [F.]\n\n\"The humble petition of the lord-mayor, sheriffs, commons, and citizens\nof the city of Dublin, in Common Council assembled,\" was issued as a\nbroadside on 8th September, 1724. See also Appendix IX. [T.S.]]\n\nAnd if the dread of Wood's halfpence should continue till next\nquarter-sessions (which I hope it will not) the gentlemen of every\ncounty will then have a fair opportunity of declaring against them with\nunanimity and zeal.\n\nI am with the greatest respect,\n  (May it please your lordships and worships)\n                  Your most dutiful\n                        and obedient servant,\n                                            M.B.\n\nAug. 25, 1724.\n\n\n\nLETTER IV.\n\nA LETTER TO THE WHOLE PEOPLE OF IRELAND.\n\n\nNOTE\n\nThe country was now in a very fever of excitement. Everywhere meetings\nwere held for the purpose of expressing indignation against the\nimposition, and addresses from brewers, butchers, flying stationers, and\ntownspeople generally, were sent in embodying the public protest against\nWood and his coins. Swift fed the flame by publishing songs and ballads\nwell fitted for the street singers, and appealing to the understandings\nof those who he well knew would effectively carry his message to the\nvery hearths of the poorest labourers. Courtier and student, tradesman\nand freeman, thief and prostitute, beggar and loafer, all were alike\ncarried by an indignation which launched them on a maelstrom of\nenthusiasm. So general became the outcry that, in Coxe's words, \"the\nlords justices refused to issue the orders for the circulation of the\ncoin.... People of all descriptions and parties flocked in crowds to the\nbankers to demand their money, and drew their notes with an express\ncondition to be paid in gold and silver. The publishers of the most\ntreasonable pamphlets escaped with impunity, provided Wood and his\npatent were introduced into the work. The grand juries could scarcely be\ninduced to find any bill against such delinquents; no witnesses in the\nprosecution were safe in their persons; and no juries were inclined, or\nif inclined could venture, to find them guilty.\"\n\nIn such a state of public feeling Swift assumed an entirely new\nattitude. He promulgated his \"Letter to the Whole People of Ireland\"--a\nletter which openly struck at the very root of the whole evil, and laid\nbare to the public eye the most secret spring of its righteous\nindignation. It was not Wood nor his coins, it was the freedom of the\npeople of Ireland and their just rights and privileges that were being\nfought for. He wrote them the letter \"to refresh and continue that\nspirit so seasonably raised among\" them, and in order that they should\nplainly understand \"that by the laws of God, of NATURE, of NATIONS, and\nof your COUNTRY, you ARE, and OUGHT to be as FREE a people as your\nbrethren in England.\" The King's prerogative had been held threateningly\nover them. What was the King's prerogative? he asked in effect. It was\nbut the right he enjoyed within the bounds of the law as made by the\npeople in parliament assembled. The law limits him with his subjects.\nSuch prerogative he respected and would take up arms to protect against\nany who should rebel. But \"all government without the consent of the\ngoverned, is the very definition of slavery.\" The condition of the Irish\nnation was such that it was to be expected eleven armed men should\novercome a single man in his shirt; but even if those in power exercise\nthen power to cramp liberty, a man on the rack may still have \"the\nliberty of roaring as loud as he thought fit.\" And the men on the rack\nroared to a tune that Walpole had never before heard.\n\nThe letter appeared on the 13th October, 1724.[1] The Duke of Grafton\nhad been recalled and Carteret had taken up the reins of government. For\nreasons, either personal or politic, he took Walpole's side. Coxe goes\ninto considerations on this attitude of Carteret's, but they hardly\nconcern us here. Suffice it that the Lord Lieutenant joined forces with\nthe party in the Irish Privy Council, among whom were Midleton and St.\nJohn Brodrick, and on October 27th issued a proclamation offering a\nreward of £300[2] for the discovery of the author of this \"wicked and\nmalicious pamphlet\" which highly reflected on his Majesty and his\nministers, and which tended \"to alienate the affections of his good\nsubjects of England and Ireland from each other.\"\n\n[Footnote 1: Not on October 23rd as the earlier editors print it, and as\nMonck Mason, Scott and Mr. Churton Collins repeat.]\n\n[Footnote 2: See Appendix, No. VI.]\n\nThe author's name was not made public, nor was it likely to be. There is\nno doubt that it was generally known who the author was. In that general\nknowledge lies the whole pith of the Biblical quotation circulated\nabroad on the heels of the proclamation: \"And the people said unto Saul,\nshall _Jonathan_ die, who had wrought this great salvation in Israel?\nGod forbid: as the Lord liveth there shall not one hair of his head fall\nto the ground, for he hath wrought with God this day: So the people\nrescued _Jonathan_ that he died not.\"\n\nSwift remained very much alive. Harding, for printing the obnoxious\nletter, had been arrested and imprisoned, and the Crown proceeded with\nhis prosecution. In such circumstances Swift was not likely to remain\nidle. On the 26th October he addressed a letter to Lord Chancellor\nMidleton in defence of the Drapier's writings, and practically\nacknowledged himself to be the author.[3] It was not actually printed\nuntil 1735, but there is no doubt that Midleton received it at the time\nit was written. What effect it had on the ultimate issue is not known;\nbut Midleton's conduct justifies the confidence Swift placed in him. The\nGrand Jury of the Michaelmas term of 1724 sat to consider the bill\nagainst Harding. On the 11th of November Swift addressed to them his\n\"Seasonable Advice.\" The bill was thrown out. Whitshed, the Chief\nJustice, consistently with his action on a previous occasion (see vol.\nvii.), angrily remonstrated with the jury, demanded of them their\nreasons for such a decision, and finally dissolved them. This\nunconstitutional, and even disgraceful conduct, however, served but to\naccentuate the resentment of the people against Wood and the patent, and\nthe Crown fared no better by a second Grand Jury. The second jury\naccompanied its rejection of the bill by a presentment against the\npatent,[4] and the defeat of the \"prerogative\" became assured. Every\nwhere the Drapier was acclaimed the saviour of his country. Any person\nwho could scribble a doggerel or indite a tract rushed into print, and\nnow Whitshed was harnessed to Wood in a pillory of contemptuous\nridicule. Indeed, so bitter was the outcry against the Lord Chief\nJustice, that it is said to have hastened his death. The cities of\nDublin, Cork and Waterford passed resolutions declaring the uttering of\nWood's halfpence to be highly prejudicial to his Majesty's revenue and\nto the trades of the kingdom. The Drapier was now the patriot, and the\nwhole nation responded to his appeal to assist him in its own defence.\n\n[Footnote 3: The highly wrought up story about Swift's butler, narrated\nby Sheridan, Deane Swift and Scott, is nothing but a sample of\neighteenth century \"sensationalism.\" Swift never bothered himself about\nwhat his servants would say with regard to the authorship of the\nLetters. Certainly this letter to Midleton proves that he was not at all\nafraid of the consequences of discovery.]\n\n[Footnote 4: See Appendix V.]\n\nThe text of the present reprint is based on that given by Sir Walter\nScott, collated with the original edition and with that reprinted in\n\"Fraud Detected\" (1725).

HARDING, When I sent you my former papers, I cannot say I intended\nyou either good or hurt, and yet you have happened through my means to\nreceive both. I pray God deliver you from any more of the latter, and\nincrease the former. Your trade, particularly in this kingdom, is of all\nothers the most unfortunately circumstantiated; For as you deal in the\nmost worthless kind of trash, the penny productions of pennyless\nscribblers, so you often venture your liberty and sometimes your lives,\nfor the purchase of half-a-crown, and by your own ignorance are punished\nfor other men's actions.\n\nI am afraid, you in particular think you have reason to complain of me\nfor your own and your wife's confinement in prison, to your great\nexpense, as well as hardship, and for a prosecution still impending. But\nI will tell you, Mr. Harding, how that matter stands. Since the press\nhath lain under so strict an inspection, those who have a mind to inform\nthe world are become so cautious, as to keep themselves if possible out\nof the way of danger. My custom is to dictate to a 'prentice who can\nwrite in a feigned hand, and what is written we send to your house by a\nblackguard boy. But at the same time I do assure you upon my reputation,\nthat I never did send you anything, for which I thought you could\npossibly be called to an account. And you will be my witness that I\nalways desired you by a letter to take some good advice before you\nventured to print, because I knew the dexterity of dealers in the law at\nfinding out something to fasten on where no evil is meant; I am told\nindeed, that you did accordingly consult several very able persons, and\neven some who afterwards appeared against you: To which I can only\nanswer, that you must either change your advisers, or determine to print\nnothing that comes from a Drapier.\n\nI desire you will send the enclosed letter, directed \"To my Lord\nViscount Molesworth at his house at Brackdenstown near Swords;\" but I\nwould have it sent printed for the convenience of his Lordship's\nreading, because this counterfeit hand of my 'prentice is not very\nlegible. And if you think fit to publish it, I would have you first get\nit read over carefully by some notable lawyer: I am assured you will\nfind enough of them who are friends to the Drapier, and will do it\nwithout a fee, which I am afraid you can ill afford after all your\nexpenses. For although I have taken so much care, that I think it\nimpossible to find a topic out of the following papers for sending you\nagain to prison; Yet I will not venture to be your guarantee.\n\nThis ensuing letter contains only a short account of myself, and an\nhumble apology for my former pamphlets, especially the last, with little\nmention of Mr. Wood or his halfpence, because I have already said enough\nupon that subject, until occasion shall be given for new fears; and in\nthat case you may perhaps hear from me again.\n\nI am,\n  Your Friend\n    and Servant,\n               M.B.\n\nFrom my shop in\nSt. Francis-street\nDec. 14. 1724.\n\n_P.S._ For want of intercourse between you and me, which I never will\nsuffer, your people are apt to make very gross errors in the press,\nwhich I desire you will provide against.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER VI\n\nA LETTER TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LORD VISCOUNT MOLESWORTH, AT HIS\nHOUSE AT BRACKDENSTOWN NEAR SWORDS.[6]\n\n\nMy Lord, I reflect too late on the maxim of common observers, that\n\"those who meddle in matters out of their calling, will have reason to\nrepent;\" which is now verified in me: For by engaging in the trade of a\nwriter, I have drawn upon myself the displeasure of the government,\nsignified by a proclamation promising a reward of three hundred pounds\nto the first faithful subject who shall be able and inclined to inform\nagainst me. To which I may add the laudable zeal and industry of my Lord\nChief Justice [Whitshed] in his endeavours to discover so dangerous a\nperson. Therefore whether I repent or no, I have certainly cause to do\nso, and the common observation still stands good.\n\n[Footnote 6: Robert, Viscount Molesworth (1656-1725), born in Dublin and\neducated at the University there, was a prominent adherent of the Prince\nof Orange during the Revolution of 1688. In 1692 William sent him to\nDenmark as envoy-extraordinary to the Court at Copenhagen; but he left\nabruptly because of the offence he gave there. Retiring to Flanders,\nMolesworth revenged himself by writing, \"An Account of Denmark as it was\nin 1692,\" in which he described that country as no fit place for those\nwho held their liberties dearly. Molesworth had been strongly imbued\nwith the republican teachings of Algernon Sidney, and his book affords\nample proof of the influence. Its publication aroused much indignation,\nand a controversy ensued in which Swift's friend, Dr. William King, took\npart. In 1695 Molesworth returned to Ireland, became a Privy Councillor\nin 1697, sat in the Irish parliament in 1703-1705, and in the English\nHouse of Commons from 1705 to 1708. In 1713 he was removed from the\nIrish Privy Council on a charge of a treasonable utterance, which Steele\nvindicated in \"The Englishman\" and \"The Crisis.\" The accession of George\nI., however, brought Molesworth into his honours again, and he was\ncreated Baron Molesworth of Philipstown, and Viscount Molesworth of\nSwords, in 1719. His work entitled \"Considerations for Promoting\nAgriculture,\" issued in 1723, was considered by Swift as \"an excellent\ndiscourse, full of most useful hints.\" At the time Swift addressed him\nthis sixth letter, Molesworth was living in retirement at Brackdenstown.\n[T.S.]]\n\nIt will sometimes happen, I know not how in the course of human affairs,\nthat a man shall be made liable to legal animadversions, where he has\nnothing to answer for, either to God or his country; and condemned at\nWestminster-hall for what he will never be charged with at the Day of\nJudgment.\n\nAfter strictly examining my own heart, and consulting some divines of\ngreat reputation, I cannot accuse myself of any \"malice or wickedness\nagainst the public;\" of any \"designs to sow sedition,\" of \"reflecting on\nthe King and his ministers,\" or of endeavouring \"to alienate the\naffections of the people of this kingdom from those of England.\"[7] All\nI can charge myself with, is a weak attempt to serve a nation in danger\nof destruction by a most wicked and malicious projector, without waiting\nuntil I were called to its assistance; which attempt, however it may\nperhaps give me the title of _pragmatical_ and _overweening_ will never\nlie a burthen upon my conscience. God knows whether I may not with all\nmy caution have already run myself into danger, by offering thus much in\nmy own vindication. For I have heard of a judge, who, upon the\ncriminal's appeal to the dreadful Day of Judgment, told him he had\nincurred a _premunire_ for appealing to a foreign jurisdiction: And of\nanother in Wales, who severely checked the prisoner for offering the\nsame plea, taxing him with reflecting on the Court by such a comparison,\nbecause \"comparisons were odious.\"\n\n[Footnote 7: The quotations are from the charges stated in the\nindictment and proclamation against the writer and printer of the\nprevious letters. [T.S.] ]\n\nBut in order to make some excuse for being more speculative than others\nof my condition, I desire your lordship's pardon, while I am doing a\nvery foolish thing, which is, to give you some little account of myself.\n\nI was bred at a free school where I acquired some little knowledge in\nthe Latin tongue, I served my apprenticeship in London, and there set up\nfor myself with good success, till by the death of some friends, and\nthe misfortunes of others, I returned into this kingdom, and began to\nemploy my thoughts in cultivating the woollen manufacture through all\nits branches Wherein I met with great discouragement and powerful\nopposers, whose objections appeared to me very strange and singular They\nargued that the people of England would be offended if our manufactures\nwere brought to equal theirs; and even some of the weaving trade were my\nenemies, which I could not but look upon as absurd and unnatural I\nremember your lordship at that time did me the honour to come into my\nshop, where I shewed you a piece of black and white stuff just sent from\nthe dyer, which you were pleased to approve of, and be my customer for\nit.[8]\n\n[Footnote 8: The \"piece of black and white stuff just sent from the\ndyer,\" refers to his pamphlet, issued in 1720, \"The Proposal for the\nUniversal Use of Irish Manufactures.\" See vol. vii. [T.S.]]\n\nHowever I was so mortified, that I resolved for the future to sit\nquietly in my shop, and deal in common goods like the rest of my\nbrethren; till it happened some months ago considering with myself that\nthe lower and poorer sort of people wanted a _plain strong coarse stuff\nto defend them against cold easterly winds, which then blew very fierce\nand blasting for a long time together_, I contrived one on purpose,\nwhich sold very well all over the kingdom, and preserved many thousands\nfrom agues I then made a second and a third kind of stuffs for the\ngentry with the same success, insomuch that an ague hath hardly been\nheard of for some time.[9]\n\n[Footnote 9: The \"cold easterly winds\" refer to the demands made on the\nIrish people to accept Wood's halfpence. The three different kinds of\n\"stuffs\" are the three letters written under the _nom de guerre,_ \"M.B.\nDrapier.\" [T.S.]]\n\nThis incited me so far, that I ventured upon a fourth piece made of the\nbest Irish wool I could get, and I thought it grave and rich enough to\nbe worn by the best lord or judge of the land. But of late some great\nfolks complain as I hear, \"that when they had it on, they felt a\nshuddering in their limbs,\" and have thrown it off in a rage, cursing to\nhell the poor Drapier who invented it, so that I am determined never to\nwork for persons of quality again, except for your lordship and a very\nfew more.[10]\n\n[Footnote 10: This refers to the fourth letter of the Drapier, which\nbrought forth the proclamation, and for the author of which the reward\nof £300 was offered. [T.S.]]\n\nI assure your lordship upon the word of an honest citizen, that I am not\nricher by the value of one of Mr. Wood's halfpence with the sale of all\nthe several stuffs I have contrived; for I give the whole profit to the\ndyers and pressers.[11] And therefore I hope you will please to believe,\nthat no other motive beside the love of my country could engage me to\nbusy my head and hands to the loss of my time and the gain of nothing\nbut vexation and ill-will.\n\n[Footnote 11: The printers [F.]]\n\nI have now in hand one piece of stuff to be woven on purpose for your\nlordship, although I might be ashamed to offer it you, after I have\nconfessed that it will be made only from the shreds and remnants of the\nwool employed in the former. However I shall work it up as well as I\ncan, and at worst, you need only give it among your tenants.\n\nI am very sensible how ill your lordship is like to be entertained with\nthe pedantry of a drapier in the terms of his own trade. How will the\nmatter be mended, when you find me entering again, though very\nsparingly, into an affair of state; for such is now grown the\ncontroversy with Mr. Wood, if some great lawyers are to be credited. And\nas it often happens at play, that men begin with farthings, and go on to\ngold, till some of them lose their estates, and die in jail; so it may\npossibly fall out in my case, that by playing too long with Mr. Wood's\nhalfpence, I may be drawn in to pay a fine, double to the reward for\nbetraying me, be sent to prison, and \"not be delivered thence till I\nshall have paid the uttermost farthing.\"\n\nThere are my lord, three sorts of persons with whom I am resolved never\nto dispute: A highwayman with a pistol at my breast, a troop of dragoons\nwho come to plunder my house, and a man of the law who can make a merit\nof accusing me. In each of these cases, which are almost the same, the\nbest method is to keep out of the way, and the next best is to deliver\nyour money, surrender your house, and confess nothing.\n\nI am told that the two points in my last letter, from which an occasion\nof offence hath been taken, are where I mention His Majesty's answer to\nthe address of the House of Lords upon Mr. Wood's patent, and where I\ndiscourse upon Ireland's being a dependent kingdom. As to the former, I\ncan only say, that I have treated it with the utmost respect and\ncaution, and I thought it necessary to shew where Wood's patent differed\nin many essential parts from all others that ever had been granted,\nbecause the contrary had for want of due information been so strongly\nand so largely asserted. As to the other, of Ireland's dependency, I\nconfess to have often heard it mentioned, but was never able to\nunderstand what it meant. This gave me the curiosity to enquire among\nseveral eminent lawyers, who professed they knew nothing of the matter.\nI then turned over all the statutes of both kingdoms without the least\ninformation, further than an Irish act, that I quoted, of the 33d of\nHenry 8th, uniting Ireland to England under one king. I cannot say I was\nsorry to be disappointed in my search, because it is certain, I could be\ncontented to depend only upon God and my prince and the laws of my own\ncountry, after the manner of other nations. But since my betters are of\na different opinion, and desire further dependencies, I shall readily\nsubmit, not insisting on the exception I made of M.B. Drapier. For\nindeed that hint was borrowed from an idle story I had heard in England,\nwhich perhaps may be common and beaten, but because it insinuates\nneither treason nor sedition, I will just barely relate it.\n\nSome hundred years ago when the peers were so great that the commons\nwere looked upon as little better than their dependents, a bill was\nbrought in for making some new additions to the power and privileges of\nthe peerage. After it was read, one Mr. Drewe a member of the house,\nstood up, and said, he very much approved the bill, and would give his\nvote to have it pass; but however, for some reasons best known to\nhimself, he desired that a clause might be inserted for excepting the\nfamily of the Drewes. The oddness of the proposition taught others to\nreflect a little, and the bill was thrown out.\n\nWhether I were mistaken, or went too far in examining the dependency\nmust be left to the impartial judgment of the world, as well as to the\ncourts of judicature, although indeed not in so effectual and decisive\na manner. But to affirm, as I hear some do, in order to countenance a\nfearful and servile spirit, that this point did not belong to my\nsubject, is a false and foolish objection. There were several scandalous\nreports industriously spread by Wood and his accomplices to discourage\nall opposition against his infamous project. They gave it out that we\nwere prepared for a rebellion, that we disputed the King's prerogative,\nand were shaking off our dependency. The first went so far, and obtained\nso much belief against the most visible demonstrations to the contrary,\nthat a great person of this kingdom, now in England, sent over such an\naccount of it to his friends, as would make any good subject both grieve\nand tremble. I thought it therefore necessary to treat that calumny as\nit deserved. Then I proved by an invincible argument that we could have\nno intention to dispute His Majesty's prerogative, because the\nprerogative was not concerned in the question, the civilians and lawyers\nof all nations agreeing that copper is not money. And lastly to clear us\nfrom the imputation of shaking off our dependency, I shewed wherein as I\nthought this dependency consisted, and cited the statute above mentioned\nmade in Ireland, by which it is enacted, that \"whoever is King of\nEngland shall be King of Ireland,\" and that the two kingdoms shall be\n\"for ever knit together under one King.\" This, as I conceived, did\nwholly acquit us of intending to break our dependency, because it was\naltogether out of our power, for surely no King of England will ever\nconsent to the repeal of that statute.\n\nBut upon this article I am charged with a heavier accusation. It is said\nI went too far, when I declared, that \"if ever the Pretender should come\nto be fixed upon the throne of England (which God forbid) I would so far\nventure to transgress this statute, that I would lose the last drop of\nmy blood before I would submit to him as King of Ireland.\"\n\nThis I hear on all sides, is the strongest and weightiest objection\nagainst me, and which hath given the most offence; that I should be so\nbold to declare against a direct statute, and that any motive how strong\nsoever, could make me reject a King whom England should receive. Now if\nin defending myself from this accusation I should freely confess, that I\n\"went too far,\" that \"the expression was very indiscreet, although\noccasioned by my zeal for His present Majesty and his Protestant line in\nthe House of Hanover,\" that \"I shall be careful never to offend again in\nthe like kind.\" And that \"I hope this free acknowledgment and sorrow for\nmy error, will be some atonement and a little soften the hearts of my\npowerful adversaries.\" I say if I should offer such a defence as this, I\ndo not doubt but some people would wrest it to an ill meaning by some\nspiteful interpretation, and therefore since I cannot think of any other\nanswer, which that paragraph can admit, I will leave it to the mercy of\nevery candid reader.\n\nI will now venture to tell your lordship a secret, wherein I fear you\nare too deeply concerned You will therefore please to know that this\nhabit of writing and discoursing, wherein I unfortunately differ from\nalmost the whole kingdom, and am apt to grate the ears of more than I\ncould wish, was acquired during my apprenticeship in London, and a long\nresidence there after I had set up for myself. Upon my return and\nsettlement here, I thought I had only changed one country of freedom for\nanother. I had been long conversing with the writings of your\nlordship,[12] Mr. Locke, Mr. Molineaux,[13] Colonel Sidney[14] and other\ndangerous authors, who talk of \"liberty as a blessing, to which the\nwhole race of mankind hath an original title, whereof nothing but\nunlawful force can divest them.\" I knew a good deal of the several\nGothic institutions in Europe, and by what incidents and events they\ncame to be destroyed; and I ever thought it the most uncontrolled and\nuniversally agreed maxim, that _freedom_ consists in a people being\ngoverned by laws made with their own consent; and _slavery_ in the\ncontrary. I have been likewise told, and believe it to be true, that\n_liberty_ and _property_ are words of known use and signification in\nthis kingdom, and that the very lawyers pretend to understand, and have\nthem often in their mouths. These were the errors which have misled me,\nand to which alone I must impute the severe treatment I have received.\nBut I shall in time grow wiser, and learn to consider my driver, the\nroad I am in, and with whom I am yoked. This I will venture to say, that\nthe boldest and most obnoxious words I ever delivered, would in England\nhave only exposed me as a stupid fool, who went to prove that the sun\nshone in a clear summer's day; and I have witnesses ready to depose that\nyour lordship hath said and writ fifty times worse, and what is still an\naggravation, with infinitely more wit and learning, and stronger\narguments, so that as politics run, I do not know a person of more\nexceptionable principles than yourself; and if ever I shall be\ndiscovered, I think you will be bound in honour to pay my fine and\nsupport me in prison; or else I may chance to inform against you by way\nof reprisal.[15]\n\n[Footnote 12: See note _ante_, p. 161.

His \"Dioptrica Nova\" contains a warm appreciation\nof Locke's \"Essay on the Human Understanding.\" He died in October, 1698,\nbut in the early part of this year, he published his famous inquiry into\nthe effect of English legislation on Irish manufactures. The work was\nentitled, \"The Case of Ireland's being bound by Acts of Parliament in\nEngland stated,\" and its publication made a great stir both in England\nand in Ireland. Molyneux attempted to show that the Irish Parliament was\nindependent of the English Parliament. His book was reported by a\nCommittee of the House of Commons, on June 22nd, 1698, to be \"of\ndangerous consequence to the Crown and Parliament of England,\" but the\nmatter went no further than embodying this resolution of the committee\nin an address to the King.

He was tried\nfor treason before Jeffreys, and in spite of a most excellent defence,\nsentenced to death. His execution took place on December 7th, 1682. [T.\nS.]]\n\n[Footnote 15: A writer, signing himself M.M., replying to this letter of\nSwift's in a broadside entitled, \"Seasonable Advice to M.B. Drapier,\nOccasioned by his Letter to the R--t. Hon. the Lord Visct. Molesworth,\"\nactually takes this paragraph to mean that Swift intended seriously to\nturn informer: \"Now sir, some people are of opinion that you carried\nthis too far, inasmuch as you become a precedent to informers: others\nthink that you intimate to his lordship, the miserable circumstance you\nare in by the menaces of the prentice to whom you dictate; they conceive\nyour declaring to inform, if not fee'd, to the contrary, signifies your\nsaid prentice on the last occasion to swear, if you don't forthwith\ndeliver him his indentures, and half of your stock to set up trade with,\nhe will inform against you, bring you to justice, be dismissed by law,\nand get the promised £300 to begin trade with; how near these\nconceptions be to truth I can't tell; but I know people think that word\n_inform_ unseasonable. . . .\" [T.S.]]\n\nIn the meantime, I beg your lordship to receive my confession, that if\nthere be any such thing as a dependency of Ireland upon England,\notherwise than as I have explained it, either by the law of God, of\nnature, of reason, of nations, or of the land (which I shall never\nhereafter contest,) then was the proclamation against me, the most\nmerciful that ever was put out, and instead of accusing me as malicious,\nwicked and seditious, it might have been directly as guilty of high\ntreason.\n\nAll I desire is, that the cause of my country against Mr. Wood may not\nsuffer by any inadvertency of mine; Whether Ireland depends upon\nEngland, or only upon God, the King and the law, I hope no man will\nassert that it depends upon Mr. Wood. I should be heartily sorry that\nthis commendable resentment against me should accidentally (and I hope,\nwhat was never intended) strike a damp upon that spirit in all ranks and\ncorporations of men against the desperate and ruinous design of Mr.\nWood. Let my countrymen blot out those parts in my last letter which\nthey dislike, and let no rust remain on my sword to cure the wounds I\nhave given to our most mortal enemy. When Sir Charles Sidley[16] was\ntaking the oaths, where several things were to be renounced, he said \"he\nloved renouncing,\" asked \"if any more were to be renounced, for he was\nready to renounce as much as they pleased.\" Although I am not so\nthorough a renouncer; yet let me have but good city security against\nthis pestilent coinage, and I shall be ready not only to renounce every\nsyllable in all my four letters, but to deliver them cheerfully with my\nown hands into those of the common hangman, to be burnt with no better\ncompany than the coiner's _effigies,_ if any part of it hath escaped out\nof the secular hands of the rabble.\n\n[Footnote 16: This must be Sir Charles Sedley (properly Sidley), the\nfamous wit and dramatist of Charles II.'s reign. In his reprint of 1735,\nFaulkner prints the name \"Sidley,\" though the original twopenny tract\nand the \"Hibernian Patriot\" print it as \"Sidney.\" Sir W. Scott corrects\nit to \"Sedley.\" [T.S.]]\n\nBut whatever the sentiments of some people may be, I think it is agreed\nthat many of those who subscribed against me, are on the side of a vast\nmajority in the kingdom who opposed Mr. Wood; and it was with great\nsatisfaction that I observed some right honourable names very amicably\njoined with my own at the bottom of a strong declaration against him and\nhis coin. But if the admission of it among us be already determined the\nworthy person who is to betray me ought in prudence to do it with all\nconvenient speed, or else it may be difficult to find three hundred\npounds in sterling for the discharge of his hire; when the public shall\nhave lost five hundred thousand, if there be so much in the nation;\nbesides four-fifths of its annual income for ever.\n\nI am told by lawyers, that in all quarrels between man and man, it is of\nmuch weight, which of them gave the first provocation or struck the\nfirst blow. It is manifest that Mr. Wood hath done both, and therefore I\nshould humbly propose to have him first hanged and his dross thrown into\nthe sea; after which the Drapier will be ready to stand his trial. \"It\nmust needs be that offences come, but woe unto him by whom the offence\ncometh.\" If Mr. Wood had held his hand every body else would have held\ntheir tongues, and then there would have been little need of pamphlets,\njuries, or proclamations upon this occasion. The provocation must needs\nhave been great, which could stir up an obscure indolent Drapier to\nbecome an author. One would almost think the very stones in the street\nwould rise up in such a cause: And I am not sure they will not do so\nagainst Mr. Wood if ever he comes within their reach. It is a known\nstory of the dumb boy, whose tongue forced a passage for speech by the\nhorror of seeing a dagger at his father's throat. This may lessen the\nwonder that a tradesman hid in privacy and silence should cry out when\nthe life and being of his political mother are attempted before his\nface, and by so infamous a hand.\n\nBut in the meantime, Mr. Wood the destroyer of a kingdom walks about in\ntriumph (unless it be true that he is in jail for debt) while he who\nendeavoured to assert the liberty of his country is forced to hide his\nhead for occasionally dealing in a matter of controversy. However I am\nnot the first who hath been condemned to death for gaining a great\nvictory over a powerful enemy, by disobeying for once the strict orders\nof military discipline.\n\nI am now resolved to follow (after the usual proceeding of mankind,\nbecause it is too late) the advice given me by a certain Dean. He shewed\nthe mistake I was in of trusting to the general good-will of the people,\n\"that I had succeeded hitherto better than could be expected, but that\nsome unfortunate circumstantial lapse would probably bring me within the\nreach of power. That my good intentions would be no security against\nthose who watched every motion of my pen, in the bitterness of my soul.\"\nHe produced an instance of \"a writer as innocent, as disinterested, and\nas well meaning as myself, where the printer, who had the author in his\npower, was prosecuted with the utmost zeal, the jury sent back nine\ntimes, and the man given up to the mercy of the court.\"[17] The Dean\nfurther observed \"that I was in a manner left alone to stand the battle,\nwhile others who had ten thousand times better talents than a Drapier,\nwere so prudent to lie still, and perhaps thought it no unpleasant\namusement to look on with safety, while another was giving them\ndiversion at the hazard of his liberty and fortune, and thought they\nmade a sufficient recompense by a little applause.\" Whereupon he\nconcluded with a short story of a Jew at Madrid, who being condemned to\nthe fire on account of his religion, a crowd of school-boys following\nhim to the stake, and apprehending they might lose their sport, if he\nshould happen to recant, would often clap him on the back, and cry,\n\"_Sta firme Moyse_ (Moses, continue steadfast).\"\n\n[Footnote 17: This was for the publication of \"A Proposal for the\nUniversal Use of Irish Manufactures.\" [T.S.]]\n\nI allow this gentleman's advice to have been good, and his observations\njust, and in one respect my condition is worse than that of the Jew, for\nno recantation will save me. However it should seem by some late\nproceedings, that my state is not altogether deplorable. This I can\nimpute to nothing but the steadiness of two impartial grand juries,\nwhich hath confirmed in me an opinion I have long entertained, that, as\nphilosophers say, \"virtue is seated in the middle,\" so in another\nsense, the little virtue left in the world is chiefly to be found among\nthe middle rank of mankind, who are neither allured out of her paths by\nambition, nor driven by poverty.\n\nSince the proclamation occasioned by my last letter, and a due\npreparation for proceeding against me in a court of justice, there have\nbeen two printed papers clandestinely spread about, whereof no man is\nable to trace the original further than by conjecture, which with its\nusual charity lays them to my account. The former is entitled,\n\"Seasonable Advice,\"[18] and appears to have been intended for\ninformation of the grand jury, upon the supposition of a bill to be\nprepared against that letter. The other[19] is an extract from a printed\nbook of Parliamentary Proceedings in the year 1680 containing an angry\nresolution of the House of Commons in England against dissolving grand\njuries. As to the former, your lordship will find it to be the work of a\nmore artful hand than that of a common Drapier. It hath been censured\nfor endeavouring to influence the minds of a jury, which ought to be\nwholly free and unbiassed, and for that reason it is manifest that no\njudge was ever known either upon or off the bench, either by himself or\nhis dependents, to use the least insinuation that might possibly affect\nthe passions or interests of any one single juryman, much less of a\nwhole jury; whereof every man must be convinced who will just give\nhimself the trouble to dip into the common printed trials; so as, it is\namazing to think, what a number of upright judges there have been in\nboth kingdoms for above sixty years past, which, considering how long\nthey held their offices during pleasure, as they still do among us, I\naccount next to a miracle.\n\n[Footnote 18: See p. 123. [T.S.]]\n\n[Footnote 19: See note on p. 127. [T.S.]]\n\nAs to the other paper I must confess it is a sharp censure of an English\nHouse of Commons against dissolving grand juries by any judge before the\nend of the term, assizes, or sessions, while matters are under their\nconsideration, and not presented; is arbitrary, illegal, destructive to\npublic justice, a manifest violation of his oath, and is a means to\nsubvert the fundamental laws of the kingdom.\n\nHowever, the publisher seems to have been mistaken in what he aimed at.\nFor, whatever dependence there may be of Ireland upon England, I hope he\nwould not insinuate, that the proceedings of a lord chief justice in\nIreland must depend upon a resolution of an English House of Commons.\nBesides, that resolution although it were levelled against a particular\nlord chief justice, Sir William Scroggs,[20] yet the occasion was\ndirectly contrary: For Scroggs dissolved the grand jury of London for\nfear they should present, but ours in Dublin was dissolved because they\nwould not present, which wonderfully alters the case. And therefore a\nsecond grand jury supplied that defect by making a presentment[21] that\nhath pleased the whole kingdom. However I think it is agreed by all\nparties, that both the one and the other jury behaved themselves in such\na manner, as ought to be remembered to their honour, while there shall\nbe any regard left among us for virtue or public spirit.\n\n[Footnote 20: Sir William Scroggs (1623?-1683) was appointed Lord Chief\nJustice of England on the removal of Sir Thomas Ramsford in 1678. One of\nthe eight articles of impeachment against Scroggs, in 1680, was for\nillegally discharging the grand jury of Middlesex before the end of the\nterm. Although the articles of impeachment were carried to the House of\nLords in 1681, the proceedings went no farther than ordering him to find\nbail and file his answer by a certain time. Scroggs was removed, on\naccount of his unpopularity, on April 11th, 1681. As a lawyer, Scroggs\nhas no great reputation; as a judge he must be classed with the\nnotorious Jeffreys. [T.S.]]\n\n[Footnote 21: See Appendix No. V. [T.S.]]\n\nI am confident your lordship will be of my sentiments in one thing, that\nsome short plain authentic tract might be published for the information\nboth of petty and grand juries, how far their power reacheth, and where\nit is limited, and that a printed copy of such a treatise might be\ndeposited in every court, to be consulted by the jurymen before they\nconsider of their verdict; by which abundance of inconveniences would be\navoided, whereof innumerable instances might be produced from former\ntimes, because I will say nothing of the present.\n\nI have read somewhere of an eastern king who put a judge to death for an\niniquitous sentence, and ordered his hide to be stuffed into a cushion,\nand placed upon the tribunal for the son to sit on, who was preferred to\nhis father's office. I fancy such a memorial might not have been\nunuseful to a son of Sir William Scroggs, and that both he and his\nsuccessors would often wriggle in their seats as long as the cushion\nlasted. I wish the relater had told us what number of such cushions\nthere might be in that country.\n\nI cannot but observe to your lordship how nice and dangerous a point it\nis grown for a private person to inform the people even in an affair\nwhere the public interest and safety are so highly concerned as that of\nMr. Wood, and this in a country where loyalty is woven into the very\nhearts of the people, seems a little extraordinary. Sir William Scroggs\nwas the first who introduced that commendable acuteness into the courts\nof judicature; but how far this practice hath been imitated by his\nsuccessors or strained upon occasion, is out of my knowledge. When\npamphlets unpleasing to the ministry were presented as libels, he would\norder the offensive paragraphs to be read before him, and said it was\nstrange that the judges and lawyers of the King's Bench should be duller\nthan all the people of England; and he was often so very happy in\napplying the initial letters of names, and expounding dubious hints (the\ntwo common expedients among writers of that class for escaping the law)\nthat he discovered much more than ever the authors intended, as many of\nthem or their printers found to their cost. If such methods are to be\nfollowed in examining what I have already written or may write hereafter\nupon the subject of Mr. Wood, I defy any man of fifty times my\nunderstanding and caution to avoid being entrapped, unless he will be\ncontent to write what none will read, by repeating over the old\narguments and computations, whereof the world is already grown weary. So\nthat my good friend Harding lies under this dilemma, either to let my\nlearned works hang for ever a drying upon his lines, or venture to\npublish them at the hazard of being laid by the heels.\n\nI need not tell your lordship where the difficulty lies. It is true, the\nKing and the laws permit us to refuse this coin of Mr. Wood, but at the\nsame time it is equally true, that the King and the laws permit us to\nreceive it. Now it is most certain the ministers in England do not\nsuppose the consequences of uttering that brass among us to be so\nruinous as we apprehend; because doubtless if they understood it in that\nlight, they are persons of too much honour and justice not to use their\ncredit with His Majesty for saving a most loyal kingdom from\ndestruction. But as long as it shall please those great persons to think\nthat coin will not be so very pernicious to us, we lie under the\ndisadvantage of being censured as obstinate in not complying with a\nroyal patent. Therefore nothing remains, but to make use of that liberty\nwhich the King and the laws have left us, by continuing to refuse this\ncoin, and by frequent remembrances to keep up that spirit raised against\nit, which otherwise may be apt to flag, and perhaps in time to sink\naltogether. For, any public order against receiving or uttering Mr.\nWood's halfpence is not reasonably to be expected in this kingdom,\nwithout directions from England, which I think nobody presumes, or is so\nsanguine to hope.\n\nBut to confess the truth, my lord, I begin to grow weary of my office as\na writer, and could heartily wish it were devolved upon my brethren, the\nmakers of songs and ballads, who perhaps are the best qualified at\npresent to gather up the gleanings of this controversy. As to myself, it\nhath been my misfortune to begin and pursue it upon a wrong foundation.\nFor having detected the frauds and falsehoods of this vile impostor Wood\nin every part, I foolishly disdained to have recourse to whining,\nlamenting, and crying for mercy, but rather chose to appeal to law and\nliberty and the common rights of mankind, without considering the\nclimate I was in.\n\nSince your last residence in Ireland, I frequently have taken my nag to\nride about your grounds, where I fancied myself to feel an air of\nfreedom breathing round me, and I am glad the low condition of a\ntradesman did not qualify me to wait on you at your house, for then I am\nafraid my writings would not have escaped severer censures. But I have\nlately sold my nag, and honestly told his greatest fault, which was that\nof snuffing up the air about Brackdenstown, whereby he became such a\nlover of liberty, that I could scarce hold him in. I have likewise\nburied at the bottom of a strong chest your lordship's writings under a\nheap of others that treat of liberty, and spread over a layer or two of\nHobbes, Filmer, Bodin[22] and many more authors of that stamp, to be\nreadiest at hand whenever I shall be disposed to take up a new set of\nprinciples in government. In the mean time I design quietly to look to\nmy shop, and keep as far out of your lordship's influence as possible;\nand if you ever see any more of my writings upon this subject, I promise\nyou shall find them as innocent, as insipid and without a sting as what\nI have now offered you. But if your lordship will please to give me an\neasy lease of some part of your estate in Yorkshire,[23] thither will I\ncarry my chest and turning it upside down, resume my political reading\nwhere I left it off; feed on plain homely fare, and live and die a free\nhonest English farmer: But not without regret for leaving my countrymen\nunder the dread of the brazen talons of Mr. Wood: My most loyal and\ninnocent countrymen, to whom I owe so much for their good opinion of me,\nand of my poor endeavours to serve them,\n\nI am\n  with the greatest respect,\n           My Lord\n    Your Lordship's most obedient\n              and most humble servant,\n                                     M.B.\n\n\nFrom my shop\nin St. Francis-Street,\nDec. 14.\n1724.\n\n[Footnote 22: Sir Robert Filmer, the political writer who suffered for\nhis adhesion to the cause of Charles I.

DRAPIER.\n\n\"Multa gemens ignominiam Plagasque superbi Victoris.--\"\n\n[VIRGIL, _Georg. III._, 226-7.]\n\n\nNOTE.\n\n\nThis letter was published in the fourth volume of the collected edition\nof Swift's Works, issued by Faulkner, in Dublin, in 1735. It is there\nstated that it was written \"before the Lord Carteret came over, and soon\nafter the fourth Drapier's letter.\" If Faulkner be correct, and he\nprobably is, the subject matter of the letter shows that it was not to\nbe printed until after the agitation had subsided. The letter is in an\nentirely different spirit from the other letters, and deals with\nsuggestions and methods of action for a general righting of the wrongs\nunder which Ireland was suffering. In matter as well as in manner it is\nnot a continuation of the contest against Wood, but an effort to send\nthe people along paths which would lead to their general welfare and\nprosperity. As such it properly concludes the Drapier series.\n\nThe text of the letter here printed is that of Faulkner collated with\nthat given in the fifth volume of \"Miscellanies,\" issued in London in.\n1735.\n\n[T.S.]\n\n\n\n\nLETTER VII.\n\nAN HUMBLE ADDRESS TO BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT.\n\n\nI have been told, that petitions and addresses, either to King or\nParliament, are the right of every subject; providing they consist with\nthat respect, which is due to princes and great assemblies. Neither do I\nremember, that the modest proposals, or opinions of private men, have\nbeen ill-received, when they have not been delivered in the style of\nadvice; which is a presumption far from my thoughts. However, if\nproposals should be looked upon as too assuming; yet I hope, every man\nmay be suffered to declare his own and the nation's wishes. For\ninstance; I may be allowed to wish, that some further laws were enacted\nfor the advancement of trade, for the improvement of agriculture, now\nstrangely neglected, against the maxim of all wise nations: For\nsupplying the manifest defects in the acts concerning plantation of\ntrees: For setting the poor to work, and many others.\n\nUpon this principle, I may venture to affirm; it is the hearty wish of\nthe whole nation, very few excepted; that the Parliament in this session\nwould begin by strictly examining into the detestable fraud of one\nWilliam Wood, now or late of London, hardwareman; who illegally and\nclandestinely, as appears by your own votes and addresses, procured a\npatent in England, for coining halfpence in that kingdom, to be current\nhere. This, I say, is the wish of the whole nation, very few excepted;\nand upon account of those few, is more strongly and justly the wish of\nthe rest: Those few consisting either of Wood's confederates, some\nobscure tradesmen, or certain bold UNDERTAKERS[1] of weak judgment, and\nstrong ambition; who think to find their accounts in the ruin of the\nnation, by securing or advancing themselves. And, because such men\nproceed upon a system of politics, to which I would fain hope you will\nbe always utter strangers, I shall humbly lay it before you.\n\n[Footnote 1: This was a phrase used in the time of Charles II. to\nexpress those dashing ministers who obtained power by undertaking to\ncarry through particular favourite measures of the crown. But the Dean\napplies it with his usual studied ambiguity, so that it may be explained\nas meaning schemers or projectors in general. [S.]]\n\nBe pleased to suppose me in a station of fifteen hundred pounds a year,\nsalary and perquisites; and likewise possessed of 800_l_. a year, real\nestate. Then, suppose a destructive project to be set on foot; such, for\ninstance, as this of Wood; which if it succeed, in all the consequences\nnaturally to be expected from it, must sink the rents and wealth of the\nkingdom one half, (although I am confident, it would have done so\nfive-sixths.) Suppose, I conceive that the countenancing, or privately\nsupporting this project, will please those by whom I expect to be\npreserved, or higher exalted. Nothing then remains, but to compute and\nbalance my gain and my loss, and sum up the whole. I suppose that I\nshall keep my employment ten years, (not to mention the fair chance of a\nbetter.) This at 1500_l_. a year, amounts, in ten years, to 15,000_l_.\nMy estate, by the success of the said project, sinks 400_l_. a year;\nwhich at twenty years' purchase, is but 8000_l_. so that I am a clean\ngainer of 7000_l_. upon the balance. And during all that period, I am\npossessed of power and credit, can gratify my favourites, and take\nvengeance of mine enemies. And if the project miscarry, my private merit\nis still entire. This arithmetic, as horrible as it appears, I knowingly\naffirm to have been practised, and applied in conjunctures, whereon\ndepended the ruin or safety of a nation: Although, probably the charity\nand virtue of a senate, will hardly be induced to believe, that there\ncan be such monsters among mankind. And yet, the wise Lord Bacon\nmentions a sort of people, (I doubt the race is not yet extinct) who\nwould \"set a house on fire, for the convenience of roasting their own\neggs at the flame.\"\n\nBut whoever is old enough to remember, and hath turned his thoughts to\nobserve the course of public affairs in this kingdom, from the time of\nthe Revolution; must acknowledge, that the highest points of interest\nand liberty, have been often sacrificed to the avarice and ambition of\nparticular persons, upon the very principles and arithmetic that I have\nsupposed: The only wonder is, how these artists were able to prevail\nupon numbers; and influence even public assemblies to become instruments\nfor effecting their execrable designs.\n\nIt is, I think, in all conscience, latitude enough for vice, if a man in\nstation be allowed to act injustice, upon the usual principles of\ngetting a bribe, wreaking his malice, serving his party, or consulting\nhis preferment; while his wickedness terminates in the ruin only of\nparticular persons: But, to deliver up our whole country, and every\nliving soul who inhabits it, to certain destruction; hath not, as I\nremember, been permitted by the most favourable casuists on the side of\ncorruption. It were far better, that all who have had the misfortune to\nbe born in this kingdom, should be rendered incapable of holding any\nemployment whatsoever, above the degree of a constable, (according to\nthe scheme and intention of a great minister[2] _gone to his own\nplace_)than to live under the daily apprehension of a few false brethren\namong ourselves. Because, in the former case we should be wholly free\nfrom the danger of being betrayed; since none could then have impudence\nenough to pretend any public good.\n\n[Footnote 2: The Earl of Sunderland. See note on p. 377 of vol. _v._ of\npresent edition. [T.S.]]\n\nIt is true, that in this desperate affair of the new halfpence, I have\nnot heard of any man above my own degree of a shopkeeper, to have been\nhitherto so bold, as, in direct terms, to vindicate the fatal project;\nalthough I have been told of some very mollifying expressions which were\nused, and very gentle expedients proposed and handed about, when it\nfirst came under debate: But, since the eyes of the people have been so\nfar opened, that the most ignorant can plainly see their own ruin, in\nthe success of Wood's attempt; these grand compounders have been more\ncautious.[3]\n\n[Footnote 3: Alluding to Walpole's overture for reducing the amount to\nbe coined to £40,000. [T.S.]]\n\nBut that the same spirit still subsists, hath manifestly appeared (among\nother instances of great compliance) from certain circumstances, that\nhave attended some late proceedings in a court of judicature. There is\nnot any commonplace more frequently insisted on, by those who treat of\nour constitution, than the great happiness and excellency of trials by\njuries; yet if this blessed part of our law be eludible at pleasure, by\nthe force of power, frowns, and artifice; we shall have little reason to\nboast of our advantage, in this particular, over other states or\nkingdoms in Europe. And surely, these high proceedings, exercised in a\npoint that so nearly concerned the life-blood of the people, their\nnecessary subsistence, their very food and raiment, and even the public\npeace; will not allow any favourable appearance; because it was obvious,\nthat so much superabundant zeal could have no other design, or produce\nany other effect, than to damp that spirit raised in the nation against\nthis accursed scheme of William Wood, and his abettors; to which spirit\nalone, we owe, and for ever must owe, our being hitherto preserved, and\nour hopes of being preserved for the future; if it can be kept up, and\nstrongly countenanced by your wise assemblies. I wish I could account\nfor such a demeanour upon a more charitable foundation, than that of\nputting our interest in over balance with the ruin of our country.\n\nI remember some months ago, when this affair was fresh in discourse; a\nperson near allied to SOMEBODY, or (as the hawkers called him) NOBODY,\nwho was thought deeply concerned, went about very diligently among his\nacquaintance, to shew the bad consequences that might follow from any\npublic resentment to the disadvantage of his ally Mr. Wood; principally\nalleging the danger of all employments being disposed of from England.\nOne of these emissaries came to me, and urged the same topic: I\nanswered, naturally, that I knew there was no office of any kind, which\na man from England might not have, if he thought it worth his asking;\nand that I looked upon all who had the disadvantage of being born here,\nas only in the condition of leasers and gleaners. Neither could I\nforbear mentioning the known fable of the countryman, who entreated his\nass to fly for fear of being taken by the enemy; but the ass refused to\ngive himself that trouble; and upon a very wise reason, because he could\nnot possibly change his present master for a worse: The enemy could not\nmake him fare harder; beat him more cruelly; nor load him with heavier\nburthens.\n\nUpon these, and many other considerations, I may affirm it to be the\nwish of the whole nation, that the power and privileges of juries were\ndeclared, ascertained, and confirmed by the legislature; and that\nwhoever hath been manifestly known to violate them, might be stigmatized\nby public censure; not from any hope that such a censure will amend\ntheir practices, or hurt their interest, (for it may probably operate\nquite contrary in both:) but that the nation may know their enemies from\ntheir friends.\n\nI say not this with any regard or view to myself; for I write in great\nsecurity; and am resolved that none shall merit at my expense further\nthan by shewing their zeal to discover, prosecute, and condemn me, for\nendeavouring to do my duty in serving my country: And yet I am conscious\nto myself that I never had the least intention to reflect on His\nMajesty's ministers, nor on any other person, except William Wood, whom\nI neither did, nor do yet conceive to be of that number. However, some\nwould have it, that I went too far; but I suppose they will now allow\nthemselves mistaken. I am sure I might easily have gone further; and I\nthink I could not easily have fared worse. And therefore I was no\nfurther affected with their proclamation, and subsequent proceedings,\nthan a good clergyman is with the sins of the people. And as to the poor\nprinter, he is now gone to appear before a higher, and before a\nrighteous tribunal.\n\nAs my intention is only to lay before your great assemblies, the general\nwishes of the nation; and as I have already declared it our principal\nwish that your first proceeding would be to examine into the pernicious\nfraud of William Wood; so I must add, as the universal opinion, that all\nschemes of commutation, composition, and the like expedients, either\navowed or implied, will be of the most pernicious consequences to the\npublic; against the dignity of a free kingdom; and prove an\nencouragement to future adventurers in the same destructive projects.\nFor, it is a maxim, which no man at present disputes, that even a\nconnivance to admit one thousand pounds in these halfpence, will\nproduce, in time, the same ruinous effects, as if we openly consented to\nadmit a million. It were, therefore, infinitely more safe and eligible,\nto leave things in the doubtful, melancholy state they are at present,\n(which, however, God forbid) and trust entirely to the general aversion\nof our people against this coin; using all honest endeavours to\npreserve, continue, and increase that aversion, than submit to apply\nthose palliatives which weak, perfidious, or abject politicians, are,\nupon all occasions, and in all diseases, so ready to administer.\n\nIn the small compass of my reading, (which, however, hath been more\nextensive than is usual to men of my inferior calling) I have observed\nthat grievances have always preceded supplies; and if ever grievances\nhad a title to such a pre-eminence, it must be this of Wood; because it\nis not only the greatest grievance that any country could suffer, but a\ngrievance of such a kind that, if it should take effect, would make it\nimpossible for us to give any supplies at all; except in adulterate\ncopper; unless a tax were laid for paying the civil and military lists,\nand the large pensions, with real commodities instead of money; which,\nhowever, might be liable to some few objections as well as difficulties:\nFor although the common soldiers might be content with beef and mutton,\nand wool, and malt, and leather; yet I am in some doubt as to the\ngenerals, the colonels, the numerous pensioners, the civil officers, and\nothers, who all live in England upon Irish pay; as well as those few who\nreside among us only because they cannot help it.\n\nThere is one particular, which although I have mentioned more than once\nin some of my former papers, yet I cannot forbear to repeat, and a\nlittle enlarge upon it; because I do not remember to have read or heard\nof the like in the history of any age or country; neither do I ever\nreflect upon it without the utmost astonishment.\n\nAfter the unanimous addresses to his Sacred Majesty, against this patent\nof Wood, from both Houses of Parliament, which are the three estates of\nthe kingdom; and likewise an address from the Privy-council, to whom,\nunder the chief governors, the whole administration is entrusted; the\nmatter is referred to a committee of council in London. Wood, and his\nadherents, are heard on one side; and a few volunteers, without any\ntrust or direction from hence, on the other. The question (as I\nremember) chiefly turned upon the want of halfpence in Ireland:\nWitnesses are called on the behalf of Wood (of what credit I have\nformerly shewn :) Upon the issue the patent is found good and legal; all\nHis Majesty's officers here, (not excepting the military) commanded to\nbe aiding and assisting to make it effectual. The addresses of both\nHouses of Parliament, of the Privy-council; and of the city of Dublin:\nThe declarations of most counties and corporations through the kingdom,\nare altogether laid aside, as of no weight, consequence, or\nconsideration whatsoever: And the whole kingdom of Ireland nonsuited, in\ndefault of appearance; as if it were a private cause between John Doe,\nplaintiff, and William Roe, defendant.\n\nWith great respect to those-honourable persons, the committee of council\nin London, I have not understood them to be our governors, councillors,\nor judges. Neither did our case turn at all upon the question, whether\nIreland wanted halfpence or no. For there is no doubt, but we do want\nboth halfpence, gold, and silver; and we have numberless other wants,\nand some that we are not so much as allowed to name; although they are\npeculiar to this nation; to which no other is subject, whom God hath\nblessed with religion and laws, or any degree of soil and sunshine: But,\nfor what demerits on our side, I am altogether in the dark.\n\nBut, I do not remember, that our want of halfpence was either affirmed,\nor denied in any of our addresses or declarations, against those of\nWood: We alleged, the fraudulent obtaining and executing his patent, the\nbaseness of his metal, the prodigious sum to be coined, which might be\nincreased by stealth, from foreign importation and his own counterfeits,\nas well as those at home; whereby we must infallibly lose all our little\ngold and silver, and all our poor remainder of a very limited and\ndiscouraged trade: We urged, that the patent was passed without the\nleast reference hither; and without mention of any security given by\nWood, to receive his own halfpence upon demand; both which are contrary\nto all former proceedings in the like cases. These, and many other\narguments we offered; but still the patent went on, and at this day our\nruin would have been half completed; if God, in His mercy, had not\nraised an universal detestation of these halfpence, in the whole\nkingdom; with a firm resolution never to receive them; since we are not\nunder obligations to do so by any law, either human or divine.\n\nBut, in the Name of God, and of all justice and piety; when the King's\nMajesty was pleased that this patent should pass; is it not to be\nunderstood, that he conceived, believed, and intended it as a gracious\nact, for the good and benefit of his subjects, for the advantage of a\ngreat and fruitful kingdom; of the most loyal kingdom upon earth, where\nno hand or voice was ever lifted up against him; a kingdom where the\npassage is not of three hours from Britain; and a kingdom where Papists\nhave less power, and less land, than in England? Can it be denied, or\ndoubted, that His Majesty's ministers understood and proposed the same\nend, the good of this nation, when they advised the passing this patent?\nCan the person of Wood be otherwise regarded, than as the instrument,\nthe mechanic, the head-workman, to prepare his furnace, his fuel, his\nmetal, and his stamps? If I employ a shoe-boy, is it in view to his\nadvantage, or to my own convenience? I mention the person of William\nWood alone, because no other appears, and we are not to reason upon\nsurmises; neither would it avail, if they had a real foundation.\n\nAllowing therefore, (for we cannot do less) that this patent, for the\ncoining of halfpence, was wholly intended, by a gracious king, and a\nwise public-spirited ministry, for the advantage of Ireland; yet when\nthe whole kingdom to a man, for whose good the patent was designed, do,\nupon maturest consideration, universally join, in openly declaring,\nprotesting, addressing, petitioning, against these halfpence, as the\nmost ruinous project that ever was set on foot, to complete the slavery\nand destruction of a poor innocent country: Is it, was it, can it, or\nwill it ever be a question, not whether such a kingdom, or William Wood,\nshould be a gainer; but whether such a kingdom should be wholly undone,\ndestroyed, sunk, depopulated, made a scene of misery and desolation, for\nthe sake of William Wood? God, of His infinite mercy, avert this\ndreadful judgment; and it is our universal wish, that God would put it\ninto your hearts to be His instruments for so good a work.\n\nFor my own part, who am but one man, of obscure condition, I do solemnly\ndeclare, in the presence of Almighty God, that I will suffer the most\nignominious and torturing death, rather than submit to receive this\naccursed coin, or any other that shall be liable to the same objections,\nuntil they shall be forced upon me, by a law of my own country; and if\nthat shall ever happen, I will transport myself into some foreign land,\nand eat the bread of poverty among a free people.\n\nAm I legally punishable for these expressions? Shall another\nproclamation issue against me, because I presume to take my country's\npart against William Wood; where her final destruction is intended? But,\nwhenever you shall please to impose silence upon me, I will submit;\nbecause, I look upon your unanimous voice to be the voice of the nation;\nand this I have been taught, and do believe to be, in some manner, the\nvoice of God.\n\nThe great ignominy of a whole kingdom, lying so long at mercy, under so\nvile an adversary, is such a deplorable aggravation, that the utmost\nexpressions of shame and rage, are too low to set it forth; and\ntherefore, I shall leave it to receive such a resentment, as is worthy\nof a parliament.\n\nIt is likewise our universal wish, that His Majesty would grant liberty\nto coin halfpence in this kingdom, for our own use; under such\nrestrictions as a parliament here shall advise: Since the power of\ncoining even gold and silver, is possessed by every petty prince abroad;\nand was always practised by Scotland, to the very time of the Union; yet\nsurely Scotland, as to soil, climate, and extent, is not, in itself, a\nfourth part the value of Ireland; (for Bishop Burnet says, it is not\nabove a fortieth part in value, to the rest of Britain) and with respect\nto the profit that England gains from hence, not the forty thousandth\npart. Although I must confess, that a mote in the eye, or a thorn in the\nside, is more dangerous and painful than a beam, or a spike at a\ndistance.\n\nThe histories of England, and of most other countries, abound in\nrelating the miserable, and sometimes the most tragical effects, from\nthe abuses of coin; by debasing the metal, by lessening, or enhancing\nthe value upon occasions, to the public loss; of which we have an\nexample, within our own memory in England, and another very lately in\nFrance. It is the tenderest point of government, affecting every\nindividual, in the highest degree. When the value of money is arbitrary,\nor unsettled; no man can well be said to have any property at all; nor\nis any wound so suddenly felt, so hardly cured, or that leaves such deep\nand lasting scars behind it.\n\nI conceive this poor unhappy island, to have a title to some indulgence\nfrom England; not only upon the score of Christianity, natural equity,\nand the general rights of mankind; but chiefly on account of that\nimmense profit they receive from us; without which, that kingdom would\nmake a very different figure in Europe, from what it doth at present.\n\nThe rents of land in Ireland, since they have been of late so enormously\nraised, and screwed up, may be computed to about two millions; whereof\none-third part, at least, is directly transmitted to those, who are\nperpetual absentees in England; as I find by a computation made with the\nassistance of several skilful gentlemen.\n\nThe other articles by which we are altogether losers, and England a\ngainer; we found to amount to almost as much more. I will only set down\nas many heads of them as I can remember; and leave them to the\nconsideration of those, who understand accounts better than I pretend to\ndo.\n\nThe occasional absentees, for business, health, or diversion.\n\nThree-fourths of the revenue of the chief governor, during his absence;\nwhich is usually four-fifths of his government.\n\nThe whole revenue of the post-office.\n\nThe numerous pensions paid to persons in England.\n\nThe pay of the chief officers of the army absent in England, which is a\ngreat sum.\n\nFour commissioners of the revenue, always absent.\n\nCivil employments very numerous, and of great income.\n\nThe vast charge of appeals to the House of Lords, and to the Court of\nDelegates.\n\nStudents at the Inns of Court, and the two Universities.\n\nEighty thousand pounds sent yearly to England, for coals; whereof the\nprime cost is nothing; and therefore, the profit wholly theirs.\n\nOne hundred thousand pounds paid several years past, for corn sent over\nhither from England; the effect of our own great wisdom in discouraging\nagriculture.\n\nThe kind liberty granted us of wearing Indian stuffs, and calicoes, to\ngratify the vanity and folly of our women; which, beside the profit to\nEngland, is an unconceivable loss to us; forcing the weavers to beg in\nour streets, or transport themselves to foreign countries.\n\nThe prodigious loss to us, and gain to England, by selling them all our\nwool at their own rates; whereof the manufacture exceeds above ten times\nthe prime cost: A proceeding without example in the Christian or heathen\nworld.\n\nOur own wool returned upon us, in English manufactures, to our infinite\nshame and damage; and the great advantage of England.\n\nThe full profit of all our mines accruing to England; an effect of great\nnegligence and stupidity.\n\nAn affectation among us, of liking all kinds of goods made in England.\n\nNOTE, Many of the above articles have been since particularly computed\nby another writer, to whose treatise the reader is referred.[4]\n\n[Footnote 4: The work referred to is \"A List of the Absentees of\nIreland, and the yearly value of their estates and Incomes spent\nabroad,\" by Thomas Prior, Esq. Prior was a native of Ireland and the\nschoolfellow and life-long friend of Berkeley, the philosopher. In\nconcert with Samuel Madden and other friends, he founded, in 1731, the\nDublin Society for the Promotion of Agriculture, Manufactures, Arts and\nSciences. This society was the parent of the present Royal Dublin\nSociety. His \"List of the Absentees of Ireland\" was published in 1729.\nHe also issued \"Observations on Coin\" (1730), and \"An Authentic\nNarrative of the Success of Tar Water in Curing a great number and\nvariety of Distempers\" (1746), to which Berkeley contributed. [T.S.]]\n\nThese and many other articles, which I cannot recollect at present, are\nagreed by judicious men to amount to near seven hundred thousand pounds\n_per ann_. clear profit to England. And, upon the whole, let any man\nlook into those authors who write upon the subject of commerce, he shall\nfind, that there is not one single article in the essentials, or\ncircumstances of trade, whereby a country can be a loser, which we do\nnot possess in the highest perfection; somewhat, in every particular,\nthat bears a kind of analogy to William Wood; and now the branches are\nall cut off, he stands ready with his axe at the root.\n\nUpon this subject of perpetual absentees, I have spent some time in very\ninsignificant reflections; and considering the usual motives of human\nactions, which are pleasure, profit, and ambition, I cannot yet\ncomprehend how those persons find their account in any of the three. I\nspeak not of those English peers or gentlemen, who, beside their estates\nat home, have possessions here; for, in that case, the matter is\ndesperate; but I mean those lords, and wealthy knights, or squires,\nwhose birth, and partly their education, and all their fortune (except\nsome trifle, and that in very few instances) are in this kingdom. I knew\nmany of them well enough, during several years, when I resided in\nEngland; and truly I could not discover that the figure they made was,\nby any means, a subject for envy; at least it gave me two very different\npassions: For, excepting the advantage of going now and then to an\nopera, or sometimes appearing behind a crowd at Court; or adding to the\nring of coaches in Hyde Park, or losing their money at the Chocolate\nHouse; or getting news, votes, and minutes, about five days before us in\nDublin, I say, besides these, and a few other privileges of less\nimportance, their temptations to live in London, were beyond my\nknowledge or conception. And I used to wonder, how a man of birth and\nspirit, could endure to be wholly insignificant and obscure in a foreign\ncountry, when he might live with lustre in his own; and even at less\nthan half that expense, which he strains himself to make, without\nobtaining any one end; except that which happened to the frog when he\nwould needs contend for size with the ox. I have been told by scholars,\nthat Caesar said, he would rather be the first man, in I know not what\nvillage, than the second in Rome. This, perhaps, was a thought only fit\nfor Caesar: But to be preceded by thousands, and neglected by millions;\nto be wholly without power, figure, influence, honour, credit, or\ndistinction, is not, in my poor opinion, a very amiable situation of\nlife, to a person of title, or wealth, who can so cheaply and easily\nshine in his native country.\n\nBut, besides the depopulating of the kingdom, the leaving so many parts\nof it wild and uncultivated, the ruin of so many country-seats and\nplantations, the cutting down all the woods to supply expenses in\nEngland; the absence of so many noble and wealthy persons, hath been the\ncause of another fatal consequence, which few perhaps have been aware\nof. For if that very considerable number of lords, who possess the\namplest fortunes here, had been content to live at home, and attend the\naffairs of their own country in Parliament; the weight, reputation, and\ndignity thereby added to that noble House, would, in all human\nprobability, have prevented certain proceedings, which are now ever to\nbe lamented; because they never can be remedied: And we might have then\ndecided our own properties among ourselves, without being forced to\ntravel five hundred miles by sea and land, to another kingdom, for\njustice; to our infinite expense, vexation, and trouble: Which is a mark\nof servitude without example, from the practice of any age or nation in\nthe world.\n\nI have sometimes wondered, upon what motive the peerage of England were\nso desirous to determine our controversies; because I have been assured,\nand partly know, that the frequent appeals from hence, have been very\nirksome to that illustrious body; and whoever hath frequented the\nPainted Chamber, and Court of Requests, must have observed, that they\nare never so nobly filled, as when an Irish appeal is under debate.\n\nThe peers of Scotland, who are very numerous, were content to reside in\ntheir castles and houses, in that bleak and barren climate; and although\nsome of them made frequent journeys to London, yet I do not remember any\nof their greatest families, till very lately, to have made England their\nconstant habitation, before the Union: Or, if they did, I am sure it was\ngenerally to their own advantage; and whatever they got, was employed to\ncultivate and increase their own estates; and by that means enrich\nthemselves and their country.\n\nAs to the great number of rich absentees, under the degree of peers;\nwhat particular ill effects their absence may have upon this kingdom,\nbesides those already mentioned, may perhaps be too tender a point for\nme to touch. But whether those who live in another kingdom, upon great\nestates here; and have lost all regards to their own country, further\nthan upon account of the revenues they receive from it: I say, whether\nsuch persons may not be prevailed on to recommend others to vacant\nseats, who have no interest here, except a precarious employment; and\nconsequently can have no views, but to preserve what they have got, or\nto be higher advanced: This, I am sure, is a very melancholy question,\nif it be a question at all.\n\nBut, besides the prodigious profit which England receives by the\ntransmittal thither of two-thirds of the revenues of this whole kingdom;\nit hath another mighty advantage by making our country a receptacle,\nwherein to disburthen themselves of their supernumerary pretenders to\noffices; persons of second-rate merit in their own country; who, like\nbirds of passage, most of them thrive and fatten here, and fly off when\ntheir credit and employments are at an end. So that Ireland may justly\nsay what Luther said of himself; POOR Ireland maketh many rich.\n\nIf amidst all our difficulties, I should venture to assert, that we have\none great advantage, provided we could improve it as we ought; I believe\nmost of my readers would be long in conjecturing what possible advantage\ncould ever fall to our share. However, it is certain, that all the\nregular seeds of party and faction among us are entirely rooted out, and\nif any new ones shall spring up, they must be of equivocal generation,\nwithout any seed at all; and will justly be imputed to a degree of\nstupidity beyond even what we have been ever charged with upon the score\nof our birth-place and climate.\n\nThe parties in this kingdom (including those of modern date) are, First,\nof those who have been charged or suspected to favour the Pretender; and\nthose who were zealous opposers of him. Secondly, of those who were for\nand against a toleration of Dissenters by law. Thirdly, of High and Low\nChurch; or, (to speak in the cant of the times) of Whig and Tory: And,\nFourthly, of court and country. If there be any more, they are beyond my\nobservation or politics: For as to subaltern or occasional parties, they\nhave all been derivations from the same originals.\n\nNow, it is manifest, that all these incitements to faction, party, and\ndivision are wholly removed from among us. For, as to the Pretender, his\ncause is both desperate and obsolete: There are very few now alive who\nwere _men_ in his father's time, and in that prince's interest; and in\nall others, the obligation of conscience hath no place;[5] even the\nPapists in general, of any substance, or estates, and their priests\nalmost universally, are what we call Whigs in the sense which by that\nword is generally understood. They feel the smart, and see the scars of\ntheir former wounds; and very well know, that they must be made a\nsacrifice to the least attempts towards a change; although it cannot be\ndoubted, that they would be glad to have their superstition restored,\nunder any prince whatsoever.\n\n[Footnote 5: That is to say, they had not sworn any allegiance to him.\n[T.S.]]\n\nSecondly, The Dissenters are now tolerated by law; neither do we observe\nany murmurs at present from that quarter, except those reasonable\ncomplaints they make of persecution, because they are excluded from\ncivil employments; but their number being very small in either House of\nParliament, they are not yet in a situation to erect a party: Because,\nhowever indifferent men may be with regard to religion, they are now\ngrown wise enough to know, that if such a latitude were allowed to\nDissenters; the few small employments left us in cities and\ncorporations, would find other hands to lay hold on them.\n\nThirdly, The dispute between High and Low Church is now at an end;\ntwo-thirds of the bishops having been promoted in this reign, and most\nof them from England, who have bestowed all preferments in their gift to\nthose they could well confide in: The deaneries all except three, and\nmany principal church-livings, are in the donation of the crown: So that\nwe already possess such a body of clergy as will never engage in\ncontroversy upon that antiquated and exploded subject.\n\nLastly, As to court and country parties, so famous and avowed under most\nreigns in English Parliaments: This kingdom hath not, for several years\npast been a proper scene whereon to exercise such contentions; and is\nnow less proper than ever; many great employments for life being in\ndistant hands, and the reversions diligently watched and secured; the\ntemporary ones of any inviting value are all bestowed elsewhere as fast\nas they drop; and the few remaining, are of too low consideration to\ncreate contests about them, except among younger brothers, or tradesmen\nlike myself. And, therefore, to institute a court and country party\nwithout materials, would be a very new system in politics, and what I\nbelieve was never thought on before; nor, unless in a nation of idiots,\ncan ever succeed. For the most ignorant Irish cottager will not sell his\ncow for a groat.\n\nTherefore, I conclude, that all party and faction, with regard to public\nproceedings, are now extinguished in this kingdom; neither doth it\nappear in view how they can possibly revive; unless some new causes be\nadministered; which cannot be done without crossing the interests of\nthose who are greatest gainers by continuing the same measures. And,\ngeneral calamities without hope of redress, are allowed to be the great\nuniters of mankind.\n\nHowever we may dislike the causes; yet this effect of begetting an\nuniversal concord among us in all national debates, as well as in\ncities, corporations, and country neighbourhoods, may keep us at least\nalive, and in a condition to eat the little bread allowed us in peace\nand amity. I have heard of a quarrel in a tavern, where all were at\ndaggers-drawing, till one of the company cried out, desiring to know the\nsubject of the quarrel; which, when none of them could tell, they put up\ntheir swords, sat down, and passed the rest of the evening in quiet. The\nformer part hath been our case; I hope the latter will be so too; that\nwe shall sit down amicably together, at least until we have something\nthat may give us a title to fall out; since nature hath instructed even\na brood of goslings to stick together while the kite is hovering over\ntheir heads.\n\nIt is certain, that a firm union in any country, where every man wishes\nthe same thing with relation to the public, may, in several points of\nthe greatest importance, in some measure, supply the defect of power;\nand even of those rights which are the natural and undoubted inheritance\nof mankind. If the universal wish of the nation upon any point, were\ndeclared by the unanimous vote of the House of Commons, and a reasonable\nnumber of Lords; I should think myself obliged in conscience to act in\nmy sphere according to that vote; because, in all free nations, I take\nthe proper definition of law to be the will of the majority of those who\nhave the property in land; which, if there be a monarchy, is to be\nconfirmed by the royal assent. And, although such votes or declarations\nhave not received such a confirmation, for certain accidental reasons;\nyet I think they ought to be of much weight with the subject; provided\nthey neither oppose the King's prerogative, endanger the peace of the\nnation, nor infringe any law already in force; none of which, however,\ncan reasonably be supposed. Thus, for instance, if nine in ten of the\nHouse of Commons, and a reasonable number of native temporal peers,\nshould declare, that whoever received or uttered brass coin, except\nunder certain limitations and securities, should be deemed as enemies to\nthe King and the nation; I should think it a heinous sin in myself to\nact contrary to such a vote: And, if the same power should declare the\nsame censure against those who wore Indian stuffs and calicoes, or\nwoollen manufactures imported from abroad, whereby this nation is\nreduced to the lowest ebb of misery; I should readily, heartily, and\ncheerfully pay obedience; and to my utmost power persuade others to do\nthe like: Because, there is no law of this land obliging us either to\nreceive such coin, or to wear such foreign manufactures.\n\nUpon this last article, I could humbly wish that the reverend the clergy\nwould set us an example, by contenting themselves with wearing gowns,\nand other habiliments of Irish drapery; which, as it would be some\nincitement to the laity, and set many hands to work; so they would find\ntheir advantage in the cheapness; which is a circumstance not to be\nneglected by too many among that venerable body.[6] And, in order to\nthis, I could heartily desire, that the most ingenious artists of the\nweaving trade, would contrive some decent stuffs and silks for\nclergymen, at reasonable rates.[7]\n\n[Footnote 6: This hath since been put in practice, by the persuasions,\nand influence of the supposed author; but much defeated by the most\ninfamous fraud of shop-keepers. [F.]]\n\n[Footnote 7: This scheme was likewise often urged to the weavers by the\nsupposed author; but he could never prevail upon them to put it in\npractice. [F.]]\n\nI have pressed several of our most substantial brethren, that the whole\ncorporation of weavers in silk and woollen, would publish some\nproposals, (I wish they would do it to both Houses of Parliament)\ninviting persons of all degrees, and of both sexes, to wear the woollen\nand silk manufactures of our own country; entering into solemn, mutual\nengagements, that the buyer shall have good, substantial, merchantable\nware for his money; and at a certain rate, without the trouble of\ncheapening: So that, if I sent a child for a piece of stuff of a\nparticular colour and fineness, I should be sure not to be deceived; or\nif I had reason to complain, the corporation should give me immediate\nsatisfaction; and the name of the tradesman who did me the wrong, should\nbe published; and warning given not to deal with him for the future;\nunless the matter plainly appeared to be a mistake: For, besides the\ntrouble of going from shop to shop; an ignorant customer runs the hazard\nof being cheated in the price and goodness of what he buys; being forced\nto an unequal combat with a dexterous, and dishonest man, in his own\ncalling. Thus our goods fall under a general disreputation; and the\ngentry call for English cloth, or silk, from an opinion they have (and\noften too justly by our own faults) that the goodness more than makes up\nfor the difference of price.\n\nBesides, it hath been the sottish and ruinous practice of us tradesmen,\nupon any great demand of goods, either at home or from abroad, to raise\nthe prices immediately, and manufacture the said goods more slightly and\nfraudulently than before.\n\nOf this foul and foolish proceeding, too many instances might be\nproduced; and I cannot forbear mentioning one, whereby this poor kingdom\nhath received such a fatal blow in the only article of trade allowed us\nof any importance that nothing but the success of Wood's project, could\noutdo it. During the late plague in France, the Spaniards, who buy their\nlinen cloths in that kingdom, not daring to venture thither for fear of\ninfection; a very great demand was made here for that commodity, and\nexported to Spain: But, whether by the ignorance of the merchants, or\ndishonesty of the Northern weavers, or the collusion of both; the ware\nwas so bad, and the price so excessive, that except some small\nquantity, which was sold below the prime cost, the greatest part was\nreturned back: And I have been told by very intelligent persons, that if\nwe had been fair dealers, the whole current of the linen trade to Spain\nwould have taken its course from hence.\n\nIf any punishment were to be inflicted on numbers of men; surely there\ncould none be thought too great for such a race of traitors, and enemies\nto God and their country; who for the prospect of a little present gain,\ndo not only ruin themselves, (for that alone would be an example to the\nrest, and a blessing to the nation) but sell their souls to hell, and\ntheir country to destruction; And, if the plague could have been\nconfined only to these who were partakers in the guilt, had it travelled\nhither from Marseilles, those wretches would have died with less title\nto pity, than a highwayman going to the gallows.\n\nBut, it happens very unluckily, that, for some time past, all endeavours\nor proposals from private persons, to advance the public service;\nhowever honestly and innocently designed, have been called _flying in\nthe King's face:_ And this, to my knowledge, hath been the style of some\npersons, whose ancestors, (I mean those among them who had any) and\nthemselves, have been flying in princes' faces these fourscore years;\nand from their own inclinations would do so still, if their interest did\nnot lead them rather to fly in the face of a kingdom; which hath given\nthem wings to enable them for such a flight.\n\nThus, about four years ago, when a discourse was published, endeavouring\nto persuade our people to wear their own woollen manufactures,[8] full\nof the most dutiful expressions to the King, and without the least party\nhint; it was termed \"flying in the King's face;\" the printer was\nprosecuted in the manner we all remember; (and, I hope, it will\nsomewhere be remembered further) the jury kept eleven hours, and sent\nback nine times, till they were under the necessity of leaving the\nprisoner to the mercy of the court, by a special verdict. The judge on\nthe bench invoking God for his witness, when he asserted, that the\nauthor's design was to bring in the Pretender.[9]\n\n[Footnote 8: This was Swift's pamphlet entitled, \"A Proposal for the\nUniversal Use of Irish Manufactures.\" [T.S.]]\n\n[Footnote 9: The action and language of Justice Whitshed. [T.S.]]\n\nAnd thus also, my own poor endeavours to prevent the ruin of my country,\nby the admission of Wood's coin, was called by the same persons, \"flying\nin the King's face;\" which I directly deny: For I cannot allow that\nvile representation of the royal countenance in William Wood's\nadulterate copper, to be his Sacred Majesty's face; or if it were, my\nflying was not against the impression, but the baseness of the metal;\nbecause I well remembered; that the image which Nebuchadnezzar\n\"commanded to be set up, for all men to fall down and worship it,\" was\nnot of _copper_, but pure _gold_. And I am heartily sorry, we have so\nfew royal images of that metal among us; the sight whereof, although it\ncould hardly increase our veneration for His Majesty, which is already\nso great; yet would very much enliven it with a mixture of comfort and\nsatisfaction.\n\nAlexander the Great, would suffer no statuary, except Phidias, to carve\nhis image in stone or metal. How must he have treated such an operator\nas Wood, who goes about with sackfuls of dross; odiously misrepresenting\nhis Prince's countenance; and would force them, by thousands, upon every\none of us, at above six times the value.\n\nBut, notwithstanding all that hath been objected by William Wood\nhimself; together with his favourers, abettors, supporters, either\npublic or private; by those who connive at his project, or discourage\nand discountenance his opposers, for fear of lessening their favour, or\nhazarding their employments; by those who endeavour to damp the spirit\nof the people raised against this coin; or check the honest zeal of such\nas by their writings, or discourses, do all they can to keep it up:\nThose softeners, sweeteners, compounders; and expedient-mongers, who\nshake their heads so strongly, that we can hear their pockets jingle; I\ndid never imagine, that, in detecting the practices of such enemies to\nthe kingdom, I was \"flying in the King's face\"; or thought they were\nbetter representers of His Majesty, than that very coin, for which they\nare secret or open advocates.\n\nIf I were allowed to recite only those wishes of the nation, which may\nbe in our power to attain; I think they might be summed up in these few\nfollowing.\n\nFirst, That an end might be put to our apprehensions of Wood's\nhalfpence, and to any danger of the like destructive scheme for the\nfuture.\n\nSecondly; That halfpence might be coined in this kingdom, by a public\nmint, with due limitations.\n\nThirdly, That the sense of both Houses of Parliament, at least of the\nHouse of Commons, were declared by some unanimous and hearty votes,\nagainst wearing any silk or woollen manufactures, imported from abroad,\nas likewise against wearing Indian silks or calicoes, which are\nforbidden under the highest penalties in England: And it behoves us, to\ntake example from so wise a nation; because we are under a greater\nnecessity to do so, since we are not allowed to export any woollen\nmanufactures of our own; which is the principal branch of foreign trade\nin England.\n\nFourthly, That some effectual methods may be taken to civilize the\npoorer sort of our natives, in all those parts of this kingdom where the\nIrish abound; by introducing among them our language and customs; for\nwant of which they live in the utmost ignorance, barbarity and poverty;\ngiving themselves wholly up to idleness, nastiness, and thievery, to the\nvery great and just reproach of too many landlords. And, if I had in me\nthe least spirit of a projector, I would engage that this might be\neffected in a few years, at a very inconsiderable charge.[10]\n\n[Footnote 10: Since this hint was suggested, several useful seminaries\nhave been instituted, under the name of \"Charter Working Schools,\" in\nIreland, supported by the royal benefaction of a thousand pounds a year,\nby a tax on hawkers and pedlars, and by voluntary subscriptions. The\nschools are for the education of boys and girls born of Popish parents;\nin most of them, the children manufacture their own clothing, and the\nboys are employed in matters relative to husbandry. [F.]\n\nThese Charter Schools, founded by Marsh, Bishop of Clogher, and adopted\nby Primate Boulter in 1733, were intended \"to rescue the souls of\nthousands of poor children from the dangers of Popish superstition and\nidolatry, and their bodies from the miseries of idleness and beggary.\"\nIn reality the scheme was one by which it was hoped to prevent the\ngrowth of Catholicism. The conditions and methods of instruction were\npositively cruel, since the children were actually withheld from any\ncommunication with their parents. Mr. Lecky deals with the subject fully\nin the first volume of his \"Ireland in the Eighteenth Century,\" Froude\ngives the scheme his praise and admiration, but at the time of its\ninstitution it was the cause of \"an intensity of bitterness hardly\nequalled by any portion of the penal code. Parents would rather do\nanything than send their children into such prisons where, at last, they\nwould receive an education which, to their minds, must lead them to\nforfeit their soul's salvation.\" [T.S.]]\n\nFifthly, That due encouragement should be given to agriculture; and a\nstop put to that pernicious practice of graziers; engrossing vast\nquantities of land, sometimes at great distance; whereby the country is\nextremely depopulated.\n\nSixthly, That the defects in those acts for planting forest trees, might\nbe fully supplied, since they have hitherto been wholly ineffectual;\nexcept about the demesnes of a few gentlemen; and even there, in\ngeneral, very unskilfully made, and thriving accordingly. Neither hath\nthere yet been due care taken to preserve what is planted, or to enclose\ngrounds; not one hedge, in a hundred, coming to maturity, for want of\nskill and industry. The neglect of copsing woods cut down, hath likewise\nbeen of very ill consequences. And if men were restrained from that\nunlimited liberty of cutting down their own woods before the proper\ntime, as they are in some other countries; it would be a mighty benefit\nto the kingdom. For, I believe, there is not another example in Europe,\nof such a prodigious quantity of excellent timber cut down, in so short\na time, with so little advantage to the country, either in shipping or\nbuilding.\n\nI may add, that absurd practice of cutting turf, without any regularity;\nwhereby great quantities of restorable land are made utterly desperate,\nmany thousands of cattle destroyed, the turf more difficult to come at,\nand carry home, and less fit for burning; the air made unwholesome by\nstagnating pools and marshes; and the very sight of such places\noffensive to those who ride by. Neither should that odious custom be\nallowed, of cutting scraws, (as they call them) which is flaying off the\ngreen surface of the ground, to cover their cabins; or make up their\nditches; sometimes in shallow soils, where all is gravel within a few\ninches; and sometimes in low ground, with a thin greensward, and sloughy\nunderneath; which last turns all into bog, by this mismanagement. And,\nI have heard from very skilful country-men, that by these two practices\nin turf and scraws, the kingdom loseth some hundreds of acres of\nprofitable land every year; besides the irreparable loss of many skirts\nof bogs, which have a green coat of grass, and yet are mangled for turf;\nand, besides the want of canals, by regular cutting, which would not\nonly be a great convenience for bringing their turf home at an easy\nrate; but likewise render even the larger bogs more dry and safe, for\nsummer pasture.\n\nThese, and some other speculations of the like kind, I had intended to\npublish in a particular discourse against this session of Parliament;\nbecause, in some periods of my life, I had opportunity and curiosity to\nobserve, from what causes those great errors, in every branch of country\nmanagement, have arisen; of which I have now ventured to relate but few,\nout of very many; whereof some, perhaps, would not be mentioned without\ngiving offence; which I have endeavoured, by all possible means, to\navoid. And, for the same reason, I chose to add here, the little I\nthought proper to say on this subject.\n\nBut, as to the lands of those who are perpetual absentees, I do not see\nany probability of their being ever improved. In former times, their\ntenants sat at easy rents; but for some years past, they have been,\ngenerally speaking, more terribly racked by the dexterity of merciless\nagents from England, than even those held under the severest landlords\nhere. I was assured upon the place, by great numbers of credible people,\nthat a prodigious estate in the county of Cork, being let upon leases\nfor lives, and great fines paid; the rent was so high, that the tenants\nbegged leave to surrender their leases, and were content to lose their\nfines.\n\nThe cultivating and improvement of land, is certainly a subject worthy\nof the highest enquiry in any country, but especially in ours; where we\nare so strangely limited in every branch of trade, that can be of\nadvantage to us; and utterly deprived of those, which are of the\ngreatest importance; whereof I defy the most learned man in Europe, to\nproduce me an example from any other kingdom in the world: For, we are\ndenied the benefits which God and nature intended to us; as manifestly\nappears by our happy situation for commerce, and the great number of\nour excellent ports. So that, I think, little is left us, beside the\ncultivating our own soil, encouraging agriculture, and making great\nplantations of trees, that we might not be under the necessity of\nsending for corn and bark from England, and timber from other countries.\nThis would increase the number of our inhabitants, and help to consume\nour natural products, as well as manufactures at home. And I shall never\nforget what I once ventured to say to a great man in England; \"That few\npoliticians, with all their schemes, are half so useful members of a\ncommonwealth, as an honest farmer; who, by skilfully draining, fencing,\nmanuring, and planting, hath increased the intrinsic value of a piece of\nland; and thereby done a perpetual service to his country;\" which it is\na great controversy, whether any of the former ever did, since the\ncreation of the world; but no controversy at all, that ninety-nine in a\nhundred, have done abundance of mischief.\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX I\n\nADDRESSES TO THE KING[1]\n\n\n\"To the King's most Excellent MAJESTY: _The humble_ ADDRESS _of the_\nKnights, Citizens _and_ Burgesses, _in Parliament assembled._\n\n\"MOST GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN,\n\nIt is with the utmost Concern, that We, Your Majesty's most dutiful\nsubjects, the Commons of IRELAND in Parliament assembled, find ourselves\nindispensably obliged, to represent to Your Majesty, our unanimous\nOpinion: That the importing and uttering of _Copper Farthings_ and\n_Halfpence_ by virtue of the Patent lately granted to _William Wood,_\nEsq.; under the Great Seal of _Great Britain,_ will be highly\nprejudicial to Your Majesty's Revenue, destructive of the trade and\ncommerce of this nation, and of the most dangerous consequence to the\nproperties of the subject.\n\n[Footnote 1: Addresses by the House of Commons and the House of Lords\npresented to the King in conformity with the resolutions passed by these\nHouses.

But although the copper\nwas very good, and the money, one piece with another, was full weight,\nyet the single pieces were not so equally coined in the weight as they\nshould have been.\n\n[Footnote 1: The copy of this Report as here printed is taken from the\ntract already quoted in previous notes, entitled, \"A Defence of the\nConduct of the People of Ireland in their unanimous Refusal of Mr.\nWood's Copper-money ... Dublin: Printed for George Ewing, at the Angel\nand Bible in Dames-Street, MDCCXXIV.\" As already noted, the assayists\nhad for trial only those coins which were coined between March, 1723,\nand March, 1724, and these coins were neither imported into Ireland nor\nattempted to be uttered there. As Wood asked for the assay, he no doubt\nknew what he was about. But even as it stands, the Report was not very\nfavourable to him. The author of the tract named above enters minutely\ninto this point, and for a further inquiry the reader is referred to\npages 15 to 19 of his publication. [T.S.]]\n\n\"We found also that thirty and two old half-pence coined for Ireland in\nthe reigns of King Charles 2d., King James 2d., and King William 3d. and\nQueen Mary, and produced by Mr. Wood, weighed six ounces and eight\npennyweight _Troy_, that is, one hundred and three grains and a half\napiece one with another. They were much worn, and if about six or seven\ngrains be allowed to each of them one with another for loss of their\nweight by wearing, the copper-money coined for England, in the reign of\nKing William being already as much lightened by wearing, they might at\nfirst weigh about half a pound _avoirdupois_; whereas only thirty of\nthose coined by Mr. Wood are to be of that. They were also made of bad\ncopper, two of those coined in the reign of King Charles II. wasted much\nin the fire, and then spread thin under the hammer, but not so well\nwithout cracking as those of Mr. Wood.

Thus much I thought fit to observe, lest the world should be\ntoo apt to make an obvious pun upon me; when beginning to dream upon\nthis occasion, I presented it with the wild nocturnal rovings of an\nunguided imagination, on a subject of so great importance, as the final\nwelfare or ruin of a whole nation.\n\n[Footnote 1: The following tract, written probably by Thomas Sheridan,\nSwift's humorous friend, is interesting as affording an example of the\nlighter kind of literature brought into existence by this agitation. It\nmay be that Swift had a hand in its composition. The text is taken from\na copy of the original broadside in the South Kensington Collection. It\nwas published during the height of the controversy. [T.S.]]\n\nBut so it was, that upon reading one of the Drapier's letters, I fell\nasleep, and had the following dream:\n\nThe first object that struck me was a woman of exquisite beauty, and a\nmost majestic air, seated on a throne, whom by the figure of a lion\nbeneath her feet, and of Neptune who stood by her, and paid her the most\nrespectful homage, I easily knew to be the Genius of England; at some\ndistance from her, (though not at so great an one as seemed to be\ndesired,) I observed a matron clothed in robes so tattered and torn,\nthat they had not only very nigh lost their original air of royalty and\nmagnificence, but even exposed her to the inclemency of the weather in\nseveral places, which with many other afflictions had so affected her,\nthat her natural beauty was almost effaced, and her strength and spirits\nvery nigh lost. She hung over a harp with which, if she sometimes\nendeavoured to sooth her melancholy, she had still the misfortune to\nfind it more or less out of tune, particularly, when as I perceived at\nlast, it was strung with a sort of wire of so base composition, that\nneither she nor I could make anything of it. I took particular notice,\nthat, when moved by a just sense of her wrongs, she could at any time\nraise her head, she fixed her eyes so stedfastly on her neighbour,\nsometimes with an humble and entreating, at others, with a more bold and\nresentful regard, that I could not help (however improbable it should\nseem from her generous august appearance) in a great measure to\nattribute her misfortunes to her; but this I shall submit to the\njudgment of the world.\n\nI should now at last mention the name, were not these circumstances too\nunhappily singular to make that any way necessary.\n\nAs I was taken up with many melancholy reflections on this moving\nobject, I was on a sudden interrupted by a little sort of an uproar,\nwhich, upon turning my eyes towards it, I found arose from a crowd of\npeople behind her throne; the cause it seems was this:\n\nThere was, I perceived, among them the god of merchandise, with his\nsandals, mostly of brass, but not without a small proportion of gold and\nsilver, and his wings chiefly of the two latter metals, but allayed with\na little of the former; with those he used to trudge up and down to\nfurnish them with necessaries; with these he'd take a flight to other\ncountries, but not so dexterously or to so good purpose as in other\nplaces of his office, not so much for want of encouragement among 'em\nhere, as on account of the haughty jealousy of their neighbours, who, it\nseems dreading in them a rival, took care to clip his wings and\ncircumscribe his flights; the former, more especially, being, by these\nand other means so much worn, he performed his office but lamely, which\ngave occasion to some who had their own private interest more at heart,\nthan that of the public, to patch up some of the places that were worn,\nwith a metal of the same nature indeed, but so slight and base, that\nthough at first it might serve to carry him on their errands, it soon\nfailed, and by degrees grew entirely useless; insomuch, that he would\nrather be retarded than promoted in his business, and this occasioned\nthe above disturbances among his dependents, who thereupon turned their\neyes towards their mistress (for by this time she will I presume be\nbetter known by that, than the more homely and sociable name of\nneighbour) and not daring of late to say or do anything without her\napprobation, made several humble applications to her, beseeching that\nshe would continue them that liberty of refitting these implements\nthemselves, which she had been formerly pleased graciously to allow 'em;\nbut these, however reasonable, were all rejected, whereupon I observed a\ncertain person (a mean ill-looking fellow) from among a great number of\npeople that stood behind the genius of England, who, during the whole\naffair had kept his eyes intently fixed on his neighbours, watching all\ntheir motions, like a hawk hovering over his quarry, and with just the\nsame design: Him, I say, I observed to turn off hastily, and make\ntowards the throne, where being arrived, after some preparations\nrequisite, he preferred a petition, setting forth the wants and\nnecessities, (but taking care to make 'em appear at least four times\ngreater than they really were) of his neighbours, or as he might have\nmore truly and honestly said his own, both which, for the latter, though\nnot expressed, he chiefly intended, but modestly or rather knavishly\nleft to be understood, he begged the royal licence to redress, by\nsupplying those defects which were the occasion of 'em. This humble\nsuppliant I observed both before and after this petition, seemed to\nemploy his utmost industry and art, to insinuate himself into the good\ngraces of two persons that stood on each side the throne;[2]the one on\nthe right was a lady of large make and swarthy complexion; the other, a\nman, that seemed to be between fifty and sixty, who had an air of deep\ndesigning thought: These two he managed with a great deal of art; for\nthe lady he employed all the little arts that win her sex, particularly,\nI observed, that he frequently took hold of her hand, as in raptures, to\nkiss it, in such a manner as made me suspect she did not always draw it\nback empty; but this he did so slily, that it was not easy for anybody\nto be certain of it: The man on the other hand, he plied his own way\nwith politics, remonstrating to him the several things he had before the\nthrone; which however, as might be presumed from his manner of attending\nto them, seemed to make little impression; but when he came to lay\nbefore him the great advantages that might accrue from thence to their\nmistress, and consequently to him, he heard him with the utmost\neagerness and satisfaction; at last, having plainly told him, that he\nhimself should be a considerable gainer by it, and thereupon, that every\nthing that came to his hands of that nature should be at his service: As\na sort of token or earnest he kissed his hand in the same manner he had\nthe lady's, and so retired; by these and the like means he soon brought\nover both parties to him, who, with a whisper or two, procured him the\nroyal licence; whereupon he immediately fell to making up a metal, if it\ndeserved the name, of a very strange composition, wherewith he purposed\nto refit the implements of that useful deity, but in such manner, that\nfor the base metal he put into them, he would take care to draw away\nfrom them an infinitely more than proportionable quantity of gold and\nsilver, and thereby render him almost incapable of taking flight to\nforeign countries; nay, at last perhaps utterly so, when under pretence\nof their not being completed, he should filch in more of his metal, and\nfilch away more of theirs.\n\n[Footnote 2: The Duchess of Kendal and Sir Robert Walpole. [S.]]\n\nThese things being therefore prepared, he sends 'em over to his\nneighbours, and there endeavoured to get them admitted by fair words and\npromises, being too sensible that they were not of themselves the most\nwilling to accept of his favour, and indeed he was not deceived; for\nthey being advertised of his designs, had taken the alarm, and had\nalmost to a man united in one common faction against him. This generous\nardour had first taken hold of the most active and important part, and\nif I may be allowed to call it, the heart of this body, from thence was\non one side by a quick passage, and in its more refined parts,\ncommunicated through the blood to the contemplative, and reasoning, the\nhead, which it inspired with noble thoughts and resolutions; and on the\nother, to the inferior extremities, which were thereby rendered more\nexpedite and readier to obey the dictates of the head in a rougher\nmethod of opposition, from each of which extremities being carried back\nto its fountain, it was returned to them from thence, and so backwards\nand forwards, till the circulation and union were confirmed and\ncompleted, the sordid unnatural, offensive parts being in the meantime\nthrown off as dregs of nature, and nuisances of human society; but of\nthese in so well-tempered a constitution, there were but few; however,\nwhen there were any to be found, though they had been of the most\nexalted nature, and bore most noble offices in this body, by any\ncorruption became so, they shared the common fate, with this only\ndifference, that they were rejected with greater scorn and contempt on\naccount of their former dignity, as was found in one notorious instance;\nbut on the other hand, among all the parts that were serviceable to the\nconstitution on this occasion, there was not one more so, than a certain\none whose name indeed is not openly known, but whose good offices and\nusefulness are too great ever to be forgotten; for it by its nice\ndiligence and skill selected out things of the most noble and exquisite\nnature, by infusing and dispersing them to enliven and invigorate the\nwhole body, which how effectually they did, our bold projector sadly\nexperienced. For finding all his endeavours to pass his ware upon them,\ndisappointed, he withdrew; but his patron on the other side being\ninformed of what had passed, fell into a most terrible passion, and\nthreatened, they say, I know not what, of making to swallow and ramming\ndown throats; but while they were in deep conference together, methought\nall on a sudden a trap-door dropped, and down fell our projector; this\nunexpected accident did on many accounts not a little alarm the throne,\nand gave it but too great occasion to reflect a little on what had been\ndoing, as what a mean ordinary fellow it had intrusted with the care of\nan affair of so great consequence that though their neighbours' refusal\nmight possibly have put him to such straits as might be the great\noccasion of this disgrace, yet that very refusal could not be so\nuniversal and resolute without some reason, which could arise from\nnothing else but the unseasonableness or unworthiness of his offers, or\nboth, and he, consequently, must deserve as much to suffer as they did;\nnot for the better information, therefore in these surmises some of the\nneighbours were consulted, who confirming them, things seemed to bear a\ngood face, and be in a very fair way of clearing up. When I awoke, I\ncannot say whether more pleased at the present posture of affairs, when\nI recollected how indifferent an one they had lately been in, or anxious\nwhen upon considering that they were not yet firm and settled, I was led\nto reflect in general on the uncertainty of events, and in particular,\non the small reason the persons in hand can have to promise themselves\nprosperous ones, especially when they are depending in that part of the\nworld.\n\nDublin, printed in the year 1724-5.\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX IV\n\nA LETTER FROM A FRIEND TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE ------[1]\n\nCeteri, quanto quis servitio promptior, opibus et honoribus extollerentur:\nInvalido legum auxilio, quae vi, ambitu, postremo pecunia\nturbabantur.--_Tacit. An._\n\nTo THE RIGHT HONOURABLE ------\n\n\nI fear your lordship in your wonted zeal for the interest of your\ncountry will think this paper very unseasonable; but I am very confident\nnot more than one man in this kingdom will be of your lordship's\njudgment.\n\n[Footnote 1: The two following severe letters are directly addressed to\nLord Chief Justice Whitshed, and were generally circulated. They\nprobably underwent Swift's correction, though they have too much of a\nlegal cast to have been written by the Dean himself.... They were,\nperhaps, composed by Mr. Robert Lindsay, distinguished by Swift in his\nletter to Lord Midleton, as an eminent lawyer, as well as a man of\nvirtue and learning, whose legal advice he used during the whole\ncontroversy. [S.]\n\nThe present letters are taken from copies of the original broadsides in\nthe South Kensington collection. [T.S.]]\n\nIn matters of law your opinion has from our first acquaintance entirely\nguided me, and the things you have assured me I might depend upon as\nlaw, have few of them escaped my memory, though I have had but little\nconversation with you since you first appeared in Parliament and moved\nthe House to resolve, That it is the indispensable duty of the judges of\nthis kingdom to go through their circuits; nor have I had any since you\nfell sick and was made solicitor-general.\n\nI have often heard your lordship affirm, and therefore I do affirm it,\nThat the great ends for which grand juries were instituted, were the\nsupport of the government, the safety of every man's life and fortune,\nit being necessary some should be trusted to inquire after all\ndisturbers of the peace, that they might be prosecuted and brought to\ncondign punishment; and it is no less needful for every man's quiet and\nsafety, that the trust of such inquisitions should be put into the hands\nof persons of understanding and integrity, that will suffer no man to be\nfalsely accused or defamed; nor the lives of any to be put in jeopardy,\nby the malicious conspiracies of great or small, or the perjuries of any\nprofligate wretches.\n\nSo material a part of our constitution are grand juries, so much does\nthe security of every subject depend upon them, that though anciently\nthe sheriff was by express law, chosen annually by the people of the\ncounty, and trusted with the power of the county, yet the law left not\nthe election of grand juries to the will of the sheriff, but has\ndescribed their qualifications, which if they have, and the sheriff\nreturn them, no man, nay no judge, can object to their being sworn, much\nless may they to their serving when sworn: And to prevent the\ndiscretionary power (a new-fashioned term) of these judges over juries,\nyou used to say was made the statute of the 11th of Hen. 4.\n\nPardon me my lord if I venture to affirm, That a dissolving power is a\nbreach of that law, or at least an evasion, as every citizen in Dublin\nin Sir Constantine Phipps's time perfectly understood, that disapproving\nthe aldermen lawfully returned to the Privy-council was in effect\nassuming the power of choosing and returning----But your lordship and\nI know dissolving and disapproving are different terms.\n\nI always understood from your Lordship the trust and power of grand\njuries is or ought to be accounted amongst the greatest and of most\nconcern, next to the legislative: The honour, reputations, fortunes and\nlives of every man being subject to their censure; the kings of England\nhave an undoubted power of dissolving parliaments, but dissolving 'till\none was returned to their or their ministers' liking, has never been\nthought very righteous, and Heaven be praised never very successful.\n\nI am entirely of your lordship's opinion, the oath of a grand juryman is\nnot always sufficiently considered by the jurors, which is as follows.\n\n\"You shall diligently enquire, and true presentment make of all such\narticles, matters and things as shall be given you in charge; And of all\nother matters and things as shall come to your own knowledge, touching\nthis present service. The King's counsel your fellows' and your own you\nshall keep secret,\" &c.--And from some other men's behaviour, I fear\noaths are not always as sacredly observed as they ought to be: \"The\nKing's counsel, your fellows' and your _own_ you shall keep\nsecret\"--Though our grandmothers my lord might have thought there was a\ndispensing power in the Pope, you and I profess no power upon earth can\ndispense with this oath, so that to force a man to discover the counsel\nhe is sworn to keep, is to force him into direct perjury.\n\nSuppose upon information taken before your Lordship of a rape committed,\na bill of indictment were sent to a grand jury, and the grand jury\nreturn _ignoramus_ on it, application is made to the Court to\nrecommend it to them to reconsider it, and they return as before\n_ignoramus_--Suppose a judge with more than decent passion should ask\nthem their reasons (which is their counsel) for so doing, nay should be\nso particular as to demand of them whether they thought the woman a\nwhore. Must not all the world conclude somebody had forgot the oath of a\ngrand juryman? Yes sure, or his own, or worse.--But suppose they should\nask a juror a question might criminate himself? My Lord, you know I put\nnot bare possibilities, it is generally believed these things have been\ndone within an oak of this town--And if I am rightly informed, the\nrestraint a juror is under by his oath, is so well understood, that a\ncertain person desired the clerk of the Crown to change the form of it\nby adding this exception: \"unless by leave or order of the Court.\"\n\nThese things, my Lord, would seem strange in Westminster-hall, and would\nbe severely noted in St. Stephen's Chapel. The honour of the Crown would\nbe thought a very false as well as weak plea for such proceedings there,\nas indeed it is an infamous one everywhere, for 'tis a scandal upon a\nking, if he is represented in a court of justice, as if he were\npartially concerned or rather inclined to desire, that a party should be\nfound guilty, than that he should be declared innocent.\n\nThe King's interest and honour is more concerned in the protection of\nthe innocent, than in the punishment of the guilty, as in all the\nimmediate actions of his Majesty we find that maxim pursued, a maxim can\nnever run a prince into excesses. We do not only find those princes\nrepresented in history under odious characters, who have basely betrayed\nthe innocent, but such as by their spies and informers were too\ninquisitive after the guilty, whereas none was ever blamed for clemency,\nor for being too gentle interpreters of the law. Though Trajan was an\nexcellent prince, endowed with all heroical virtues; yet the most\neloquent writers, and his best friends, found nothing more to be praised\nin his government, than that in his time, all men might think what they\npleased, and every man speak what he thought, this I say, that if any\namongst us by violent measures, and a dictatorial behaviour have raised\njealousies in the minds of His Majesty's faithful subjects, the blame\nmay lie at their door.\n\nI know it has been said for His Majesty's service, grand juries may be\nforced to discover their counsels: But you will confess a king can do\nnothing against law, nor will any honest man judge that for his service,\nwhich is not warranted by law. If a constant uninterrupted usage, can\ngive the force of a law, then the grand jurymen are bound by law, as\nwell as by their oaths, to keep the King's, their fellows' and their own\ncounsel secret. Bracton and Britton in their several generations bear\nwitness, that it was then practised; and greater proof of it needs not\nbe sought, than the disputes that appear by the law-books to have been\namongst the ancient lawyers, Whether it was treason or felony for a\ngrand juryman to discover their counsels--The trust of grand juries was\nin those days thought so sacred, and their secrecy of so great concern\nto the kingdom, that whosoever should break their oaths, was by all\nthought worthy to die, only some would have them suffer as traitors,\nothers as felons.\n\nIf a king's commands should come to the judges of a court of justice or\nto a jury, desiring them to vary from the direction of the law, (which\nit is criminal to say, and no man ought to be believed therein) they are\nbound by their oaths not to regard them. The statute of 2 of E. 3. 8.\nand 20 E. 3. I. are express; and the substance of these and other\nstatutes is inserted into the oaths taken by every judge; and if they be\nunder the most solemn and sacred tie in the execution of justice to hold\nfor nothing the commands of the King under the great seal, then surely\npolitical views and schemes, the pleasure or displeasure of a minister,\nin the like case ought to be less than nothing.\n\nIt is a strange doctrine that men must sacrifice the law to secure their\nproperties, if the law is to be fashioned for every occasion, if grand\njurymen contrary to their oaths must discover their fellows' and their\nown counsels, and betray the trust the law has reposed in them, if they\nmust subject the reasons of their verdicts to the censure of the judges,\nwhom the law did never design to trust with the liberty, property, or\ngood name of their fellow-subjects. No man can say he has any security\nfor his life or fortune, and they who do not themselves, may however see\ntheir best friends and nearest relations suffer the utmost violences and\noppressions.\n\nWhich leads me to say a few words of the petit jury, not forgetting Mr.\nWalters. I am assured by an eminent lawyer, that the power and office of\na petit jury is judicial, that they only are the judges from whose\nsentence the indicted are to expect life or death. Upon their integrity\nand understanding the lives of all that are brought in judgment do\nultimately depend; from their verdict there lies no appeal, by finding\nguilty or not guilty. They do complicately resolve both law and fact. As\nit hath been the law, so it hath always been the custom and practice of\nthese juries (except as before) upon all general issues, pleaded in\ncases civil as well as criminal, to judge both of the law and fact. So\nit is said in the report of the Lord Chief Justice Vaughan in Bushell's\ncase, That these juries determine the law in all matters where issue is\njoined and tried, in the principal case whether the issue be about\ntrespass or debt, or disseizin in assizes, or a tort or any such like,\nunless they should please to give a special verdict with an implicate\nfaith in the judgment of the Court, to which none can oblige them\nagainst their wills.\n\nIt is certain we may hope to see the trust of a grand juryman best\ndischarged when gentlemen of the best fortunes and understandings attend\nthat service, but it is as certain we must never expect to see such men\non juries, if for differing with a judge in opinion, when they only are\nthe lawful judges, they are liable to be treated like villains, like\nperjurers, and enemies to their king and country; I say my lord such\nbehaviour to juries will make all gentlemen avoid that duty, and instead\nof men of interest, of reputation and abilities, our lives, our\nfortunes, and our reputations must depend upon the basest and meanest of\nthe people.\n\nI know it is commonly said, _boni judicis est ampliare juridictionem_.\nBut I take that to be better advice which was given by the Lord\nChancellor Bacon upon swearing a judge; That he would take care to\ncontain the jurisdiction of the court within the ancient mere-stones\nwithout removing the mark.\n\nI intend to pay my respects to your lordship once every month 'till the\nmeeting of the Parliament, when our betters may consider of these\nmatters, and therefore will not trouble you with any more on this\nsubject at present. But conclude, most heartily praying----\n\nThat from depending upon the will of a judge, who may be corrupted or\nswayed by his own passions, interests, or the impulse of such as support\nhim and may advance him to greater honours, the God of mercy and of\njustice deliver this nation.\n\n          I am, my lord,\n  Your lordship's most obedient humble servant,\n                                             N.N.\nDec. the First 1724.\n     Dublin: Printed in the Year 1724.\n\n\n\n\nA SECOND LETTER FROM A FRIEND TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE ------\n\n\nMy Lord,\n\nI think the best service men employed by His Majesty can do for him and\nthis country, is to shew such prudence and temper in their behaviours as\nmay convince every man they are not intrusted with any power but what is\nnecessary and will always be exercised for the advantage and security of\nHis Majesty's subjects.\n\nFor my own part I hold it the duty of every man though he has not the\nhonour of serving His Majesty in public employment, not only, not to\nmisrepresent the actions of his servants, but in matters of small\nconcern, to wink at their follies and mistakes; I know the Jacobites and\nPapists our irreconcilable enemies are too watchful to lay hold of every\noccasion to misrepresent His Majesty and turn the faults of ambitious\nand self-interested servants upon the best of kings.\n\nI hear some men say, that in my last to your lordship, there appears\nmore of the satirist, than becomes a man engaged merely in the defence\nof liberty and justice; But I am satisfied I can with charity affirm,\nthey are either such as have no knowledge of the several steps [that]\nhave been taken to bring this poor country into ruin and disgrace, or\nthey are of the number of those who have had a share in the actings and\ncontrivances against it; for my lord, he must rather be an insensible\nstoic than an angry cynic, who can survey the measures of some men\nwithout horror and indignation--To see men act as if they had never\ntaken an oath of fidelity to their king, whose interest is inseparable\nfrom that of his people, but had sworn to support the ruinous projects\nof abandoned men (of whatever faction) must rouse the most lethargic, if\nhonest, soul.\n\nI who have always professed myself a Whig do confess it has mine.\n\nI beg leave in this place to explain what I intended in my last by the\nwords, \"unless by leave or order of the court,\" lest whilst I plead for\njustice I should do an injury to your lordship.\n\nI do declare I never heard that story of your lordship, and I hope no\nman did believe it of you. My intention was by that hint to remember you\nof Judge U--p--n and a certain assizes held at Wicklow, as I believe\nyour lordship understood it, and as I now desire all the world may.\n\nHaving learned from your lordship and other lawyers of undoubted\nabilities, that no judge ought by threats or circumvention to make a\ngrand-juryman discover the king's counsel his fellows' or his own I\nshould not at present say anything in support of that position. But that\nI find a most ridiculous and false explanation seem to mislead some men\nin that point: Say they, by the word counsel is understood, such bills\nas are before the grand jury and the evidence the prosecutors for the\ncrown have to support the charge against the subject--Lest that being\nknown the party indictable may fly from justice, or he may procure false\nwitnesses to discredit the evidence for the king, or he may by bribes\nand other indirect measures take off the witnesses for the crown.\n\nI confess _I_ take that to be the meaning of the word counsel, but I am\ncertain that is not _all_ that is meant by it, that is what must be\nunderstood when it is called the king's counsel, _id est_, the counsel\nor reasons for which the king by his servants, his attorney-general or\ncoroner, has drawn and sent to the grand jury a charge against a\nsubject.\n\nBut the counsel of a juror is a different thing, it is the evidence, the\nmotives and reasons that induce him or his fellow-jurors to say _billa\nvera_ or _ignoramus_, and the opinion he or they happen to be of when the\nquestion is put by the foreman for finding or not finding: This counsel\nevery man is sworn to keep secret, that so their opinion and advice may\nnot be of prejudice to them hereafter, That as they are sworn to act\nwithout favour or affection, so may they also act without FEAR. Whereas,\nwere it otherwise the spirit of revenge is so universal, there are but\nfew cases wherein a juror could act with safety to himself; either the\nprosecuted, as where the bill is found, or the prosecutor, where it is\nreturned _ignoramus_, may contrive to defame the jurors who differ from\nthem in opinion: As I am told has happened to some very honest citizens\nwho are represented to be Jacobites since their opinions were know to be\nagainst ----. And sometimes revenge or ambition may prompt men to carry\nit further, as in the case of Mr. Wilmer, who in King Charles 2d's time\nwas very severely handled for being one of an _ignoramus_ jury.----\n'Tis not necessary to say whom he disobliged by being so.----But if I\nremember right his case was this.\n\nHe was a merchant, (and as I said, an _ignoramus_ juryman) had\ncovenanted with a servant boy to serve him in the West Indies, and\naccordingly sent him beyond sea: Upon suggestion and affidavit by which\nany person might have it, a writ _de homine replegiando_ was granted\nagainst Mr. Wilmer; the sheriffs would have returned on the writ the\nagreement and the boy's consent, but the court (in the case of this\nWilmer) Easter 34, Cha. 2. [_i.e.,_ Charles the Second] in B.R. ruled\nthey must return _replegiari fecimus_ or _elongavit_, that is, they had\nreplevy'd the boy, or that Wilmer had carried him away where they could\nnot find him, in which last case Mr. Wilmer, though an innocent person\nmust have gone to gaol until he brought the boy into court or he must\nhave been outlawed--Shower's Rep. 2 Part.\n\nI do not say this that I think the same thing will be practised again,\nor anything like it, though I know that very homely proverb, \"More ways\nof killing a dog than hanging him.\"--But I instance it to shew, the\ncounsels of every grand juryman should be kept secret, that he may act\nfreely and without apprehensions of resentment from the prosecuted or\nprosecutor.\n\nMy resolution when I writ to you last, was, not to have said anything in\nthis concerning the power of dissolving or dispensing, but as I have\nbeen forced to say something of the dispensing, for the same reason I\nmust of the dissolving power.--A power undoubtedly in effect including\nthat of returning, which makes me wish two men of great interest in this\nkingdom, differing in every other thing, had not undertaken to defend\nit, or they had better reasons for it than I have yet heard.\n\n'Tis said, \"This power is in the court as a right of resistance is in\nthe people, as the people have a power superior to the prerogative of\nthe prince, though no written or express law for it; so of necessity\nthough no statute directs it, and it may seem to overturn the greatest\nsecurity men have for their liberties, yet the court has a power of\ndissolving grand juries, if they refuse to find or present as the court\nshall direct.\"\n\nPray let us consider how well this concludes.\n\nThe people may do anything in defence of their lives, their religion and\nliberties, and consequently resistance is lawful, therefore an inferior\ncourt a _bene placito_ judge may----Monstrous absurdity.\n\nAnother, I am sorry I can't say more modest argument to support it is\nthis.--\n\n\"Considering,\" say they, \"grand juries, it is but reasonable a\ndiscretionary power of dissolving them should be lodged in the judges.\"\n\nBy the words \"considering grand juries,\" I must understand considering\ntheir understandings, their fortunes or their integrity, for from a want\nof one or more of those qualifications must arise the reason of such a\ndiscretionary power in the judges.\n\nThough I shall not urge it as far as I could, I will venture to say the\nargument is at least as strong the other way--considering the judges.--\n\nFirst as to their understandings, it must be confessed the benches are\ninfinitely superior to the lower professors of the law: Yet surely it\ncan't give offence to say the gentlemen of the several counties have\nunderstandings sufficient to discharge the duty of grand jurymen--If\nwant of fortune be an objection to grand jurymen, _a pari ratione_, it\nis an objection to some other men.--Besides, that the fact is not true,\nfor in their circuits, no judge goes into any county where he does not\nmeet at least a dozen gentlemen returned upon every grand jury, every\none of whom have better estates than he himself has--And these not\nduring pleasure, which last consideration, saves me the trouble of\nshewing the weakness of the objection in the third qualification.\n\n\"Ay. But it was a necessary expedient to keep out Wood's brass.\"\n\nAre the properties of the commons of this kingdom better secured by the\nknight-errantry of that day? In the name of common sense, what are we to\nbelieve? Has the undaunted spirit, the tremendous voice of ------\nfrightened Wood and his accomplices from any further attempts? Or rather\nhas not the ready compliance of ------ encouraged them to further\ntrials? The officers and attendants of his court may tremble when he\nfrowns, but who else regards it more than they do one of Wood's\nfarthings.\n\n\"There is no comparison,\" says another, \"between the affair of Sir W.\nScroggs and this of ------. Sir W. discharged a grand jury because they\nwere about to present the Duke of York for being a Papist, but ------\ndischarged the grand jury for not presenting a paper he recommended to\nthem to present as scandalous, (and in which, I say, he was a party\nreflected on.)\"\n\nI agree there is a mighty difference, but whom does it make for?\n\nA grand jury of a hundred (part of a county) take upon them to present\na no less considerable person than the king's brother and heir\npresumptive of the crown, the chief-justice thinks this a matter of too\nmuch moment for men of such sort to meddle in, but a matter more proper\nfor the consideration of Parliament: I would not be understood to\ncondemn the jury; I think they acted as became honest Englishmen and\nlovers of their country; But I say if judges could in any case be\nallowed to proceed by rules of policy, surely here was a sufficient\nexcuse. However the commons impeached him.\n\nThe determinations of ignorant or wicked judges as they are precedents\nof little weight, so they are but of little danger, and therefore it\nwill become the commons at all times to animadvert most carefully upon\nthe actions of the most knowing men in that profession.\n\nI say, my lord, _at all times_, because I hear former merit is pleaded\nto screen this action from any inquiry.\n\nI am sensible much is due to the man who has always preferred the public\ninterest to his private advantages as -------- has done. When a man has\nsignalized himself, when he has suffered for that principle, he deserves\nuniversal respect. Yet men should act agreeably to the motive of that\nrespect, and not ruin the liberty of their country to shew their\ngratitude, and so, my lord, where a man has the least pretence to that\ncharacter, I think 'tis best to pass over small offences, but never such\nas will entail danger and dishonour upon us and our posterity.\n\nThe Romans, my lord, when a question was in the senate, whether they\nshould ransom fifteen thousand citizens who had merited much by their\nformer victories, but losing one battle were taken prisoners; were\ndetermined by the advice of that noble Roman Attilius Regulus not to\nredeem them as men unworthy their further care, though probably it was\ntheir misfortunes not their faults lost that day.\n\n    Flagitio additis\nDamnum: neque amissos colores\nLuna refert medicata fuco\n\nHe thought they were not worthy to be trusted again:----\n\nTo shew them pity, in his mind, would betray the Romans to perpetual\ndanger: _Et exemplo trahenti_\n\nPerniciem veniens in aevum,\nSi non periret immiserabilis\nCaptiva pubes\n\nI hear some precedents have been lately found out to justify that\nmemorable action; but if precedents must control reason and justice, if\na man may swear he will keep his counsels secret, and yet by precedents\nmay be forced to divulge them, I would advise gentlemen very seriously\nto consider, the danger we are in; and examine what precedents there are\non each side of the question, for my part I think the commons of England\nare not a worse precedent than the judges of England.\n\nBesides it must be remembered that precedents in some cases will not\nexcuse a judge, even where they are according to the undoubted law of\nthe land, as for instance,\n\nSuppose a man says what is true, not knowing it to be true, though it be\nlogically a truth as it is distinguished, yet it is morally false; and\nso, suppose a judge give judgment according to law, not knowing it to be\nso, as if he did not know the reason of it at that time, but bethought\nhimself of a reason or precedent for it afterwards, though the judgment\nbe legal and according to precedent, yet the pronouncing of it is\nunjust; and the judge shall be condemned in the opinions of all men: As\nhappened to the Lord Chief Justice Popham a person of great learning and\nparts, who upon the trial of Sir Walter Raleigh; when Sir Walter\nobjected to reading or giving in evidence, Lord Cobham's affidavit,\ntaken in his absence, without producing the lord face to face, the lord\nbeing then forthcoming: The chief justice overruled the objection, and\nwas of opinion it should be given in evidence against Sir Walter, and\nsumming up the evidence to the jury the chief justice said, \"Just then\nit came into his mind why the accuser should not come face to face to\nthe prisoner, because, &c.\" Now if any judge has since found precedents,\nor has since picked up the opinion of lawyers, I fear he will come\nwithin the case I have put.\n\nI foresee, if ever this question happens to be debated, _you know\nwhere_, gentlemen will be divided; Some will be desirous to do their\ncountry justice and free us from all future danger of this kind; Others\nupon motives not quite so laudable, will strive to screen, and with\nothers private friendship will prevail: But I would recommend to your\nfriends, who really love their country, to consider the several\ncircumstances concurring in your lordship which probably may not in your\nsuccessor: Let them suppose a person were to fill your place, from whose\nmanifest ignorance in the law, we may reasonably conclude, his only\nmerit is an inveteracy and hatred to this country. I say how could your\nbest friends excuse themselves, if in regard to your lordship they\nshould suffer such a precedent to be handed down to such a man\nunobserved or uncensured?\n\n_Invenit etiam aemulos infaelix nequitia_--Ambitious men have not always\nbeen deterred by the unhappy fate of their predecessors, _Quid si\nfloreat vigeatque?_ But what lengths will they run if injustice and\ncorruption shall ride triumphant?\n\nHad somebody received a reprimand upon his knees in a proper place, for\ntreating a printer's jury like men convict of perjury, forcing them to\nfind a special verdict, I dare to say he had not been quite so hardy as\nto have discharged the grand jury or treated them in the manner he did,\nbecause they had not an implicit faith in the court; nor had he dared\nnot to receive a presentment made by the second grand jury against\nWood's farthings upon pretence it was informal, which I mention because\nthe worthy Drapier has mistaken the fact.\n\nSome of your lordship's screens I hear advise you to shew great humility\nand contrition for what's past, as the only means to appease the just\nindignation all sorts of men have conceived against you.----Were I well\nsecured you will not recommend this letter to the next grand jury to be\npresented, I could give you more _seasonable advice_, but happen as it\nmay I will venture to give you a little.\n\nFawning and cajoling will have but little effect on those who have had\nthe honour of your acquaintance these ten years past, for Caligula who\nused to hide his head if he heard the thunder, would piss upon the\nstatues of the gods when he thought the danger over--A better expedient\nis this,----\n\nTell men the Drapier is a Tory and a Jacobite.--That he writ \"The\nConduct of the Allies.\"--That he writ not his letters with a design to\nkeep out Wood's halfpence, but to bring in the Pretender; persuade them\nif you can, the dispute is no longer about the power of judges over\njuries, nor how much the liberty of the subject is endangered by\ndissolving them at pleasure, but that it is now become mere Whig and\nTory, a dispute between His Majesty's friends and the Jacobites, and\n'twere better to see a thousand grand juries discharged than the Tories\ncarry a question though in the right.--_Haec vulnera pro libertate\npublica excepi, hunc oculum pro vobis impendi._ Try this cant, pin a\ncloth over your eyes, look very dismal, and cry, \"I was turned out of\nemployment, when the Drapier was rewarded with a Deanery,\" I say, my\nlord, if you can once bring matters thus to bear, I have not the least\ndoubt you may escape without censure.\n\nTo your lordship's zeal and industry without doubt is owing, that the\nPapists and the Tories have not delivered this kingdom over to the\nPretender, so Caesar conquered Pompey that _Legum auctor et eversor,_\nand 'twas but just the liberty and laws of Rome should afterwards depend\nupon his will and pleasure.----The Drapier in his letter to Lord\nMolesworth has made a fair offer, \"Secure his country from Wood's\ncoinage,\" then condemn all he has writ and said as false and scandalous,\nwhen your lordship does as much I must confess it will be somewhat\ndifficult to discover the impostor.\n\nThus to keep my word with your lordship, I have much against my\ninclinations writ this, which shall be my last upon the ungrateful\nsubject.--If I have leisure, and find a safe opportunity of giving it to\nthe printer, my next shall explain what has long duped the true Whigs of\nthis kingdom.

[T.S.]]\n\nWe the Grand Jury of the county of the city of Dublin, this Michaelmas\nterm, 1724, having entirely at heart His Majesty's interest and the\nwelfare of our country, and being thoroughly sensible of the great\ndiscouragement which trade hath suffered by the apprehensions of the\nsaid coin, whereof we have already felt the dismal effects, and that the\ncurrency thereof will inevitably tend to the great diminution of His\nMajesty's revenue, and the ruin of us and our posterity: do present all\nsuch persons as have attempted, or shall endeavour by fraud or\notherwise, to impose the said halfpence upon us, contrary to His\nMajesty's most gracious intentions, as enemies to His Majesty's\ngovernment, and to the safety, peace and welfare of all His Majesty's\nsubjects of this kingdom, whose affections have been so eminently\ndistinguished by their zeal to his illustrious family, before his happy\naccession to the throne, and by their continued loyalty ever since.\n\nAs we do with all just gratitude acknowledge the services of all such\npatriots, as have been eminently zealous for the interest of His\nMajesty, and this country, in detecting the fraudulent impositions of\nthe said Wood, and preventing the passing his base coin: So we do at the\nsame time declare our abhorrence and detestation of all reflections on\nHis Majesty, and his government, and that we are ready with our lives\nand fortunes to defend his most Sacred Majesty against the Pretender and\nall His Majesty's open and secret enemies both at home and abroad: Given\nunder our hands at the Grand Jury Chamber this 28th, November, 1724.[2]\n\nGeorge Forbes,             David Tew,\nWilliam Empson,            Thomas How,\nNathaniel Pearson,         John Jones,\nJoseph Nuttall,            James Brown,\nWilliam Aston,             Charles Lyndon,\nStearn Tighe,              Jerom Bredin,\nRichard Walker,            John Sican,\nEdmond French,             Anthony Brunton,\nJohn Vereilles,            Thomas Gaven,\nPhilip Pearson,            Daniel Elwood,\nThomas Robins,             John Brunet.\nRichard Dawson,\n\n[Footnote 2: On August 20th, 1724, the Grand Jury, and the other\ninhabitants of the Liberty of the Dean and Chapter of St. Patrick's\nwaited on the Dean, and read him the following Declaration, desiring him\nto give orders for its publication:\n\n\"The Declaration of the Grand-Jury, and the rest of the inhabitants of\nthe Liberty of the Dean and Chapter of St. Patrick's, Dublin.\n\n\"We, the Grand-Jury, and other inhabitants of the Liberty of the Dean\nand Chapter of St. Patrick's, Dublin, whose names are underwritten, do\nunanimously declare and determine, that we never will receive or pay any\nof the half-pence or farthings already coined, or that shall hereafter\nbe coined, by one William Wood, being not obliged by law to receive the\nsame; because we are thoroughly convinced by the Addresses of both\nHouses of Parliament, as well as by that of his Majesty's most\nhonourable Privy-Council, and by the universal opinion of the whole\nkingdom, that the currency of the said half-pence and farthings would\nsoon deprive us of all our gold and silver, and therefore be of the most\ndestructive consequence to the trade and welfare of the nation.\" [T.\nS.]]\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX VI\n\nPROCLAMATION AGAINST THE DRAPIER.\n\n\n\"_Oct. 27th,_ 1724.\n\n\"A proclamation for discovering ye Author of ye Pamphlet intituled A\nletter to ye whole people of Ireland, by M.B.

So far as I can learn, Monck\nMason seems to have been the first historian to discover it; nor do I\nfind the fact mentioned by any of Swift's later biographers.\n\n\"It was rumoured in Swift's time,\" says Monck Mason, \"but not actually\nknown to him\" (see Drapier's Sixth Letter), \"that the Irish Privy\nCouncil had addressed his Majesty against Mr. Wood's coin. Having\ninspected the papers of the Council office, I shall lay before the\nreader the particulars of this event, which were never promulgated,\nprobably, because they had not the desired effect, the premier [Walpole]\nhaving determined, notwithstanding all opposition or advice, to\npersevere in his ill-judged project.\n\n\"On the 17th April, 1724, at a meeting of the Council, in which the Duke\nof Grafton himself presided, it was ordered, that it should be referred\nto a committee of the whole board, or of any seven or more, 'to consider\nwhat was proper to be done to allay and quiet the great fears of the\npeople, occasioned by their apprehensions of William Wood's copper money\nbecoming current among them,' On the 6th of May, the committee reported,\nthat they had considered the matter referred to them, and were of\nopinion, that an address should be sent to his Majesty, of which they\nthen presented a draught. It was again on the 19th, referred to a\ncommittee of the whole board to prepare a letter, which was accordingly\ndone on the next day.--The report was as follows:\n\n\"'To the King's Most Excellent Majesty, the humble address of the Lords\nJustices, and Privy-Council.\n\n\"'May it please your Majesty,\n\n\"'We, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Lords Justices\nand Privy Council, most humbly beg leave, at this time, to give an\ninstance of that duty, which, as upon all other occasions, so more\nespecially upon such as are of the greatest moment and importance, we\nhold ourselves always bound to pay to your Majesty.\n\n\"'Your Majesty's great council, the High Court of Parliament, being now\nprorogued, we conceive ourselves bound, by the trust which your Majesty\nhas been pleased to repose in us, and the oaths we have taken, with all\nhumility to lay before your Majesty the present state of this your\nkingdom, with reference to a great evil that appears to threaten it, to\nwhich, if a speedy remedy be not applied, the unavoidable consequence,\nas we apprehend, will be, the ruin of multitudes of your Majesty's\nsubjects, together with a great diminution of your revenue.\n\n\"'Though the fears of your Majesty's subjects of this kingdom, in\nrelation to the coinage of copper half-pence and farthings, were, in a\ngreat measure, allayed by your Majesty's most gracious resolution to do\nevery thing in your power for the satisfaction of your people, expressed\nin your Majesty's answer to the addresses of both Houses of Parliament;\nyet, the repeated intelligence from Great Britain, that William Wood has\nthe assurance to persist in his endeavours to introduce his copper\nhalf-pence and farthings amongst us, has again alarmed your faithful\nsubjects, to such a degree, as already to give a great check to our\ninland trade. If the letters patent granted to William Wood should, in\nall points, be exactly complied with, the loss to be sustained by taking\nhis half-pence and farthings would be much greater than this poor\nkingdom is able to bear. But if he, or any other persons, should, for\nthe value of gain, be tempted to coin and import even more than double\nthe quantity he by his patent is allowed to do, your people here do not\nsee how it is possible for your Majesty's chief governors of this your\nkingdom, to detect or hinder the cheat.\n\n\"'It is found by experience, that we have already a sufficient quantity\nof half-pence, to serve by way of exchange in the retailing trade, which\nis the only use of such sort of money, of which, therefore, we find\nourselves to be in no want.\n\n\"'And since, by the letters patent granted to the same William Wood, no\nman is required or commanded to take the said half-pence or farthings,\nbut the taking them is left at liberty to those who are willing so to\ndo; we most humbly submit it to your royal wisdom and goodness, whether\nit may not be for your Majesty's service, and the great satisfaction and\ngood of your subjects, and very much tend to the allaying and quieting\nof their fears, that your Majesty should cause your royal pleasure to be\nsignified to the Commissioners, and other officers of your Majesty's\nrevenue in this kingdom, that they neither receive those half-pence and\nfarthings, nor give countenance or encouragement to the uttering or\nvending of them; or that some other speedy method may be taken to\nprevent their becoming current amongst us.'\"\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX VIII\n\n\nSearching among the pamphlets of the Halliday Collection at the Royal\nIrish Academy, Dublin, I came across a tract of twelve pages, printed by\nJohn Whaley of Dublin in 1723, with the following title:\n\n\"The Patentee's Computation of Ireland, in a Letter from the Author of\nthe Whitehall Evening-Post concerning the making of Copper-Coin. As also\nthe Case and Address of both Houses of Parliament together with His\nMajesty's Most Gracious Answer to the House of Lords Address.\"\n\nThe writer of this tract in defence of the patent maintained the\nfollowing propositions:\n\n\n(1) That the Kingdom of Ireland wants a Copper Coin.\n\n(2) That the quantity of this coin will be no inconvenience to it.\n\n(3) That it is better than ever the Kingdom had, and as good as (in all\nprobability) they ever will or can have, and that the Patentee's profit\nis not extravagant, as commonly reported.\n\n(4) That the Kingdom will lose nothing by this coin.\n\n(5) That the public in Ireland will gain considerably by it, if they\nplease.\n\n(6) That the Kingdom will have £100,000 additional cash.\n\n\nAs he states his arguments, they are quite reasonable. On proposition\nthree, if his figures are correct, he is especially convincing. He\ndetails the cost of manufacture thus:\n\n                                                     _s.  d._\nCopper prepared for the coinage at his Majesty's\n  Mint at the Tower of London, costs per pound\n  weight                                              1   6\n\nCoinage of one pound weight                               3-1/2\n\nWaste and charge of re-melting                            1\n\nYearly payment to the Exchequer and Comptroller           1\n\nAllowed to the purchaser for exchange, &c.                5\n\n                                  Total charge        2   4-1/2\n\n\"So that the patentee,\" he concludes, \"makes a profit of only 1-1/2_d._\nin the half crown or about 5%.\"\n\nThe tract, however, is more interesting for the reprint it gives of the\ntwenty-eight articles stated by the people in objection to the patent\nand the coin. I give these articles in full:\n\n\n\n\nIRELAND'S CASE HUMBLY PRESENTED TO THE HONOURABLE THE KNIGHTS, CITIZENS,\nAND BURGESSES IN PARLIAMENT ASSEMBLED\n\n\nMOST HUMBLY SHEWETH,\n\nWhereas your Honours finding the late Grant or Letters Patents obtained\nby Mr. William Wood, for making Three Hundred and Sixty Tun weight of\ncopper half-pence for the Kingdom of Ireland, were to be manufactured in\nLondon &c. which money is now coining in Bristol, and that the said\nmoney was to weigh two shillings and sixpence in each pound weight, and\nthat change was to be uttered or passed for all such as were pleased to\ntake the same in this Kingdom.\n\nThat it's humbly conceived Your Honours on considering the following\nRemarks, will find the permitting such change to pass, exceeding\nInjurious and Destructive to the Nation.\n\nFirst. That the same will be a means to drain this Kingdom of all its\nGold and Silver, and ten, fifteen, or twenty per cent abated, will most\neffectually do the same.\n\n2d. That the making such money in England will give great room for\ncounterfeiting that coin, as well in this Kingdom, as where it is made.\n\n3d. That the Copper Mines of this Island which might be manufactured in\nthe nation, is by management shipped off to England by some persons at,\nor about forty shillings per tun, by others at four pounds and six\npounds per ton, which copper when smelted and refined is sold and sent\nback to this kingdom at two shillings and six pence per pound weight as\naforesaid, which is two hundred and eighty pound sterl. per ton.\n\n4th. That two shillings and sixpence per pound weight is making the said\ncoin of very small value, the said coin ought not to weigh or exceed two\nshillings in each pound weight as the English Halfpence are.\n\n5th. That all such money brought to this Nation manufactured, is to be\nentered at value, which value is in the Book of Rates, ten per cent duty\nand excise.\n\n6th. That no security is given to this Nation to make such money in any\none point, the same may be found defective in either, as to baseness of\nmetal, workmanship or weight, or to give gold and silver for the same,\nwhen the subject was, or may be burthened therewith.\n\n7th. That if such monies as aforesaid be permitted to pass in this\nnation, all persons that have gold or silver by them would not part\ntherewith, but Brass money must be carried from House to House on\nTruckles, and in the county by carts and horses, with troops to guard\nthem.\n\n8th. That such money will raise the price of all commodities from\nabroad, probably to three or four hundred per cent.\n\n9th. That linen, yarn, beef, butter, tallow, hides and all other\ncommodities, will raise to that degree by being bought with half-pence,\nand workmen paid with brass money, that commissions from abroad will not\nreach them, therefore such goods must lie on hands and remain a drugg.\n\n10th. That the excise of beer, ale, brandy, &c., and hearth-money will\nbe paid in such coin, the same falling first into the hands of the poor\nand middling people.\n\n11th. That if any trouble should happen in this nation, no army could be\nraised with such specie, but an enemy in all appearance would be\nadmitted with their gold and silver, and which would drive the nation\nbefore them.\n\n12th. The Courts of Law could not subsist, for all the suits there must\nbe supported and maintained with ready money. Viz. Gold and Silver.\n\n13th. That all the bankers must shut up their shops, no lodgment would\nbe made except Halfpence, such as would lodge their money with them,\nwould rather draw off and cause a run on them, fearing that their specie\nshould be turned into the said brass and copper money.\n\n14th. That such bills as are drawn to the country, viz. Cork, Limerick,\nWaterford, Kingsale, Deny, &c. The Exchange would be instead of a\nquarter per cent, twenty per cent and then paid in the said Brass\nspecie, by means of its being brought on cars, carts, or waggons, and\nguards to attend the same.\n\n15th. That all the rent in the Kingdom would be paid in half-pence; no\nman would give gold or silver, when he had brass money to pay the same.\n\n16th. That no one can coin or manufacture such a quantity of halfpence\nor farthings for this Kingdom, out of the same, but either he must be\nruined in the undertaking or the nation undone by his project, in taking\nsuch light money, by reason of ten per cent, duty, and probably this\nsession be made twenty or thirty per cent duty, and the exchange nine or\nten per cent. Ten per cent abated to circulate them. Ten per cent\nfactorage, freight, gabberage, key-porters, &c. all which is forty per\ncent, charged on the same.\n\n17th. That if the said Wood was obliged to make his light money not to\nexceed two shillings in the pound weight according to the English coin,\nhe would give up such grant, for six pence in each pound weight is 25\nper cent.\n\n18th. That the said twenty-five per cent is 19,360_l._ sterl. on the\nsaid 360 ton of copper, loss to this nation, by being coined out of this\nKingdom, besides 80,690_l._ of gold and silver sent out of the Kingdom\nfor brass or copper money.\n\n19th. That the copper mines of this Kingdom is believed to be the metal\nsuch copper is made of, which verifies the English saying, That Irish\npeople are wild, that would part with 200,000_l._ sterl. of their gold\nand silver, for their own copper mines, which cost them not one pound\nsterl.\n\n20th. That the said Wood's factors probably may send in fourteen years\ndouble the quantity of copper which is 720 ton, then this Kingdom loses\n38,720_l._ sterl. and parts with 161,280_l._ sterl. of their gold and\nsilver for almost nothing.\n\n21st. If any great sum was to be raised by this nation, on any emergency\nextraordinary, to serve his Majesty and his Kingdom how would it be\npossible to do the same; copper half-pence would not stem the tide, no\nsilver now to be had of value, then no gold to be seen.\n\n22d. That England also must be a great loser by such money, by reason\nthe said half-pence being from 20 to 40 grains lighter and less in value\nthan their own, so that the same will not pass in that Kingdom scarce\nfor farthings a piece, how then shall the vast quantities of goods be\npaid for, that are brought from that Kingdom here, a considerable part\nof this island must be broke and run away for want of silver and gold to\npay them their debts.\n\n23d. That if the said Wood should get all that money, what power would\nhe regard, and what temptation would he be subject unto on that head, he\nis but a man, and one almost as little known or heard of, as any one\nsubject the king has on this side the water.\n\n24th. That the vast quantity of sea-coal brought from England here,\nwould not be had for such money; the colliers will keep both their ships\nand coal at home, before they trade with such a nation, as had their\ntreasure turned into brass money.\n\n25th. That the Army must be paid with such money, none else to be had,\nthey would lay down their arms and do no duty, what blood and confusion\nthen would attend the same.\n\n26th. That no people out of any other Kingdom would come into this\ncountry to dwell, either to plant or sow, where all their money must be\nbrass.\n\n27th. That the beautiful Quay and river of Dublin which is now lined and\nfilled with ships in a most delightful order, would then be scattered to\nother harbours, as also the new Range, there and now a building, would\nbe left, nothing but empty places all as doleful as the weeping river,\ndeserted by her fleets and armies of merchants and traders.\n\n28th. That the aforesaid scheme is to be viewed and considered by a\nKing and Parliament, that will do themselves and their nation justice,\nwho will with hearts and hands, stem that tide and current, as never to\nsuffer so dutiful and loyal a people to be ruined and undone without\nrelief.\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX IX\n\nDESCRIPTIONS OF THE VARIOUS SPECIMENS OF WOOD'S COINS\n\n\nThe following descriptions of the various varieties of Wood's coins,\ntaken from a note in Monck Mason's \"History of St. Patrick's Cathedral\"\n(ed. 1819, pp. xcvi-xcvii), may be interesting to the student. The two\nvarieties of the coins given as illustrations in this volume are\nreproduced from specimens in the British Museum.\n\nMonck Mason obtains his information from Simon's \"Essay on Irish Coins,\"\nDublin, 1749, 4to; Snelling's Supplement to Simon issued in 1767; and\nthe edition of Simon's work reprinted in 1810.\n\nWith the exception of No. II. of this list all of Wood's coins had, on\none side, \"the king's head laureat, looking to the left, with this\ninscription, GEORGIUS, DEI GRATIA, REX. On the reverse is the figure of\nIreland, represented by a woman sitting, beside her, a harp: the\ndifferences consist chiefly, in variations in the attitude of the\nfigure, and in the date of the coin.\"\n\nNo. I. 1722.--Hibernia, with both her hands on the harp, which is placed\non her right side; her figure is full front, but she looks towards the\nright; round her this inscription, HIBERNIA, 1722. (Simon, plate 7,\nNumb. 160)\n\nNo. II. 1722.--Hibernia is seated as in the last, but has her head\nturned to the left, on which side there is a rock; round her is\ninscribed, HIBERNIA; in the exergue, 1722; on the obverse the usual\nhead, the inscription, GEORGIUS D.G. REX. (Snelling, plate 2, Numb. 24.)\n\nNo. III. 1722.--Hibernia, in profile, looking to the left, holding, in\nher right hand, a palm branch, resting her left on a harp; round it,\nHIBERNIA, 1722. (Simon, plate 7, Numb. 161.)\n\nNo. IV. 1723.--Hibernia, as in the last; round her, HIBERNIA, 1723.\n(Simon, plate 8, Numb. 169.)\n\nIt was some of this coin that was submitted to Sir Isaac Newton for\nassay.\n\nNo. V. 1724.--Hibernia, as in the last two, differing only in the date.\n(Mentioned by Simon, but no engraving given.)\n\nNo, VI. 1724.--Hibernia, seated as in the three preceding; round her,\nHIBERNIA: in the exergue, 1724. (Snelling, plate 2, Numb. 26.)\n\nMason notes of this specimen: \"Mr. Snelling does not specify,\nparticularly, in what respect this coin differs from those which\nprecede; his words are, 'different from any other, and very good work,\nespecially the halfpenny, which is the finest and broadest piece of his\nmoney I ever saw, and belongs to Mr. Bartlet.' They do not, however,\nappear to have attained to circulation in Ireland. A few might, perhaps,\nhave been struck off by the patentee, to distribute among his own, and\nthe minister's friends.\"\n\nNo. VII.--Mr. Snelling mentions, \"another halfpenny, which has Hibernia\npointing up with one hand to a sun in the top of the piece\"; but of this\nhe has not given any engraving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINDEX.\n\n\nAddison, made keeper of the records of Bermingham's Tower\nArmstrong, Sir Thomas, granted a patent to  coin farthings in Ireland\nArmstrong, Sir William, granted a patent to coin halfpence in Ireland\n\nBacon, Lord, on the Royal prerogative, quoted\nBerkeley, Lord, of Stratton, Master of the Rolls\nBingham, John\nBodin, Jean\nBoulter, Archbishop\nBrodrick, St. John, made a Privy Councillor\nBrown, John\nBurlington, Earl of, Lord High Treasurer of Ireland\n\nCarteret, Lord,\n  attempts to injure Walpole's reputation by means of the Wood agitation\n  made Lord Lieutenant of Ireland\n  takes Walpole's side\n  character of\n  Swift's letters to\n  his relations with Walpole\nCharles I., paid his troops with debased coin\nCoinage, the law with reference to\n  _See_ Wood's Coinage\nCoke,  Sir Edward, on the laws regarding coinage\nColeby\nConolly, William, Speaker of the Irish House of Commons\nCoxe, Archdeacon, his account of the agitation in Ireland\n\"Creed of an Irish Commoner, A\"\nCrowley, Sir Ambrose\n\nDartmouth, Lord, granted a patent to coin halfpence in Ireland\nDavies, Sir John, his \"Abridgement of Coke's Reports\"\n\"Defence of the Conduct of the People of Ireland, A,\" quoted\nDoddington, Bubb\nDrapier, the, his account of himself\n  proclamation against\nDublin, petition of the Lord Mayor, sheriffs and citizens of\nDutch, the, counterfeited debased coinage of Ireland\n\nElizabeth, Queen, her army paid with base coin\n  base money sent to Ireland by\nEwing, George, \"Defence of the Conduct of the People of\n  Ireland\" published by\n\nFilmer, Sir Robert\nFinley\nFrance, system of re coinage in\n\nGeorge I., equestrian statue of, in Dublin\nGrafton, Duke of, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland\n  recalled\n  not concerned with Wood's patent\n\nHarding, John, arrest and prosecution of\nHarley, Robert, Earl of Oxford, Swift's tribute to\nHolt, Sir John\n\nHopkins, Right Hon.

By this time light had begun to\ndawn upon the bronzed, athletic young engineer, but he preferred\nto pretend ignorance a little while longer.\n\n\"Say, don't you carry the makings?\" demanded the boy.\n\n\"You'll have to be more explicit,\" Tom retorted.  \"Just what are\nyou up to?  What do you want anyway?\"\n\n\"I want the makings for a cigarette,\" replied the boy, shifting\nuneasily to the other foot.  \"You said you'd pay me five dollars\na month and find me in everything, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Yes; everything that is necessary to living,\" Reade assented.\n\n\"Well, cigarettes are necessary to me,\" continued the boy.\n\n\"They are?\" asked Tom, opening his eyes wider.  \"Why, how does\nthat happen?\"\n\n\"Just because I am a smoker,\" returned the boy, with a sickly\ngrin.\n\n\"You are?\" gasped Tom.  \"At your age?  Why, you little wretch!\"\n\n\"That's all right, but please don't go on stringing me,\" pleaded\nthe younger American.  \"Just pass over the papers and the tobacco\npouch, and I'll get busy.  I'm suffering for a smoke.\"\n\n\"Then you have my heartfelt sympathy,\" Tom assured him.  \"I hate\nto see any boy with that low-down habit, and I'm glad that I'm\nnot in position to be able to encourage you in it.  How long have\nyou been smoking, Drew?\"\n\nAlf Drew shifted once more on his feet.\n\n\"'Bouter year,\" he answered.\n\n\"You began poisoning yourself at the age of thirteen, and you've\nlived a whole year?  No; I won't say 'lived,' but you've kept\npretty nearly alive.  There isn't much real life in you, Drew,\nI'll be bound.  Come here.\"\n\n\"Do I get the makings?\" whined the boy.\n\n\"Come here!\"\n\nDrew advanced, rather timidly, into the tent.\n\n\"Don't shrink so,\" ordered Tom.  \"I'm not going to spank you,\nthough some one ought to.  Give me your wrist.\"\n\nReade took the thin little wrist between his thumb and finger,\nfeeling for the pulse.\n\n\"Are you a doctor?\" sneered Drew.\n\n\"No; but generally I've intelligence enough to know whether a\npulse is slow or fast, full or weak.\"\n\n\"But-----\"\n\n\"Keep quiet,\" Tom commanded, as he drew out his watch.  His face\nexpressed nothing in particular as he kept the tip of his forefinger\nagainst the radial artery at the boy's wrist.\n\n\"Fine,\" commented the young engineer, a few moments later, as\nhe let go the captive wrist.\n\n\"Good pulse, eh?\" questioned Alf Drew.\n\n\"Great!\" quoth Tom.  \"Fine and wiry, and almost skips some beats.\nI'm not much of an authority on such subjects, but I believe\na boy of your age ought to have a normal pulse.  Where do you\nexpect to wind up with your 'makings' and your cigarettes?\"\n\n\"They don't hurt me,\" whined Alf.\n\n\"They don't, eh?\" demanded Reade, rising and drawing himself up\nto his full height of five-feet-eleven.  \"Drew, do you think you\nlook as healthy as I do?\"\n\nAs he stood there, erect as a soldier, with his fine athletic\nfigure revealed, and the bronze on his face seemingly inches deep,\nTom Reade looked what he was---every inch a man though still a\nboy in years.\n\n\"Do you think you look as healthy as I do?\" Tom repeated.\n\n\"No-o-o-o,\" admitted Alf.  \"But you're older'n me.\"\n\n\"Not so much, as years go,\" Tom rejoined.  \"For that matter, if\nyou go on with your cigarettes you'll be an old man before I get\nthrough with being a young man.  Fill up your chest, Alf; expand\nit---like this.\"\n\nAs he expanded his chest Reade looked a good deal more like some\nGreek god of old than a twentieth century civil engineer.\n\nAlf puffed and squirmed in his efforts to show \"some chest.\"\n\n\"That isn't the right way,\" Tom informed him.  \"Breathe deeply\nand steadily.  Draw in your stomach and expand your chest.  Fill\nup the upper part of your lungs with air.  Watch!  Right here\nat the top of the chest.\"\n\nAlf watched.  For that matter he seemed unable to remove his gaze\nfrom the splendid chest development that young Reade displayed\nso easily.  Then the boy tried to fill the upper portions of his\nown lungs in the same manner.  The attempt ended in a spasm of\ncoughing.\n\n\"Fine, isn't it?\" queried Tom Reade, scornfully.  \"The upper parts\nof your lungs are affected already, and you'll carry the work\nof destruction on rapidly.  Alf, if you ever live to be twenty you'll\nbe a wreck at best.  Don't you know that?\"\n\n\"I---I have heard folks say so,\" nodded the boy.\n\n\"And you didn't believe them?\"\n\n\"I---I don't know.\"\n\n\"Why did you ever take up smoking?\"\n\n\"All men smoke,\" argued Alf Drew.\n\n\"Lie number one.  All men _don't_ smoke,\" Tom corrected him.\n\"But I think I catch the drift of your idea.  If you smoke you\nthink men will look upon you as being more manly.  That's it, it?\"\n\n\"It must be manly, if men do it,\" Alf argued.\n\n\"You funny little shaver,\" laughed Tom, good-humoredly.  \"So you\nthink that, when men see you smoking cigarettes, they immediately\nimagine you to be one of them?  Cigarette-smoking, for a boy of\nfourteen, is the short cut to manhood, I suppose.\"\n\nTom laughed long, heartily, and with intense enjoyment.  At last\nhe paused, to remark, soberly:\n\n\"Answering your first question, Drew, I haven't the 'makings.'\nI never did carry them and never expect to.\"\n\n\"What do you smoke then?\" queried Alf, in some wonder.  \"A pipe?\"\n\n\"No; I never had that vice, either.  I don't use tobacco.  For\nyour own sake I'm sorry that you do.\"\n\n\"But a lot of men do smoke,\" argued Alf.  \"Jim Ferrers, for instance.\"\n\n\"Ferrers is a grown man, and it would show a lot more respect\non your part if a 'kid' like you would call him 'Mr. Ferrers.'\nBut I'll wager that Mr. Ferrers didn't smoke cigarettes at your\nage.\"\n\n\"I'll bet he did.\"\n\n\"We'll see.\"\n\nTom stepped to the doorway of the tent, Alf making way for him,\nand called lustily:\n\n\"Ferrers!  Oh, Mr. Ferrers!\"\n\n\"Here, sir!\" answered the voice of a man who was invisible off under\nthe trees.  \"Want me?\"\n\n\"If you please,\" Tom called back.\n\nFerrers soon appeared, puffing at a blackened corn-cob pipe.  He was\na somewhat stooped, much bronzed, rather thin man of middle age.\nFerrers had always worked hard, and his body looked slightly the\nworse for wear, though he a man of known endurance in rough life.\n\n\"Ferrers, do you know what ails this boy?\" demanded Tom.\n\n\"Laziness,\" Jim answered, rather curtly.  \"You hired him for a\nchore-boy, to help me.  He hasn't done a tap yet.  He's no good.\"\n\n\"Don't be too hard on him, Ferrers,\" pleaded Tom solemnly.  \"I've\njust heard the youngster's sad story.  Do you know what really ails\nhim?  Cigarettes!\"\n\n\"Him?  Cigarettes!\" observed Ferrers disgustedly.  \"The miserable\nlittle rascal!\"\n\n\"You see,\" smiled Tom, turning to the boy, \"just what men think\nof a lad who tries to look manly by smoking cigarettes.\"\n\n\"Cigarettes?  Manly?\" exploded Jim Ferrers, with a guffaw.  \"_Men_\ndon't smoke cigarettes.  That's left for weak-minded boys.\"\n\n\"Say, how many years you been smoking, Jim Ferrers?\" demanded Alf,\nrather defiantly.\n\n\"Answer him, please,\" requested Tom, when he saw their guide and\ncook frown.\n\n\"Lemme see,\" replied the Nevada man, doing some mental arithmetic\non his fingers.  \"I reckon I've been smoking twenty-three years,\nbecause I began when I was twenty-four years old.  Hang the stuff,\nI wish I had never begun, either.  But I didn't smoke at your\nage, papoose.  If I had done so, the men in the camps would have\nkicked me out.  Don't let me catch you smoking around any of the\nwork you're helping me on!  Is that all, Mr. Reade?  'Cause I've\ngot a power of work to do.\"\n\n\"That's all, thank you,\" Tom assured him.  \"But, Ferrers, we'll\nhave to take young Drew in hand and try to win him back to the\npath of brains and health.\"\n\n\"Say, I don't believe I'm going to like this job,\" muttered Alf\nDrew.  \"I reckon I'll be pulling my freight outer this camp.\"\n\n\"Don't go until tomorrow, anyway,\" urged Tom.  \"You'll have to go\nsome distance to find other human beings, and grub doesn't grow on\ntrees in Nevada.\"\n\nWith a sniff of scorn Ferrers tramped away.\n\n\"I guess, perhaps, what you need, Drew is a friend,\" remarked Tom,\nresting a hand on the boy's nearer shoulder.  \"Make up your mind\nthat you can't have a cigarette this afternoon, take a walk with me,\nin this fresh air and the good old sunshine.  Let's drop all talk of\ncigarettes, and give a little thought to brains and a strong body.\nThey don't flourish where you find boys smoking cigarettes.  Come\nalong!  I'm going to show you how to step out right, and just how to\nbreathe like a human being.  Let's try it.\"\n\nTom had almost to drag the boy, to make him start.  But Reade\nhad no intention of hectoring the, dough-faced little fellow.\n\nIt was rough ground along this mountain trail in the Indian Smoke\nRange of mountains, in Nevada.  Soon the pulses of both began to beat\nmore heavily.  Tom took in great breaths of the life-giving air, but\nAlf was soon panting.\n\n\"Let's stop, now,\" proposed Tom, in a kindly voice.  \"After you've\nrested a couple of minutes I'm going to show you how to breathe\nright and fill your lungs with air.\"\n\nSoon they were trying this most sensible \"stunt.\"  Alf, however,\ndidn't succeed very well.  Whenever he tried hard it set him to\ncoughing.\n\n\"You see, it's mostly due to the cigarettes,\" said Tom gravely.\n\"Alf, you've simply got to turn over a new leaf.  You're headed\njust right to have consumption.\"\n\n\"Cigarettes don't give a fellow consumption!\" retorted the younger\nboy sullenly.\n\n\"I don't believe they do,\" Tom admitted, thoughtfully.  \"Consumption\nis caused by germs, I've heard.  But germs take hold best in a\nweakened part of the body, and your lungs, Alf, are weak enough\nfor any germ to find a good place to lodge.  What you've got to do is\nto make your lungs so strong that they'll resist germs.\"\n\n\"You talk like a doctor!\"\n\n\"No; I'm trying to talk like an athlete.  I used to be a half-way\namateur athlete, Drew, and I'm still taking care of my body.\nThat's why I've never allowed any white-papered little 'coffin-nails'\nto fool around me.  Bad as your lungs are, Alf, they're not one\nwhit worse than your nerves.  You'll go to pieces if you find\nyourself under the least strain.  You'll get to shivering and crying,\nif you don't stop smoking cigarettes.\"\n\n\"Don't you believe it,\" muttered the boy, sullenly.\n\n\"Alf,\" smiled Tom, laying a hand gently on the boy's shoulder,\n\"you don't know me yet.  You haven't any idea how I can hang to\na thing until I win.  I'm going to keep hammering at you until\nI make you throw your cigarettes away.\"\n\n\"I'm never going to stop smoking 'em,\" retorted Drew.  \"There\nwouldn't be any comfort in life if I stopped.\"\n\n\"Is it as bad as that?\" queried Tom, with ready sympathy.  \"Then\nall the more reason for stopping.  Come; let's finish our walk.\"\n\n\"Say, I don't want to go down and through that thick brush,\" objected\nAlf Drew, slowing his steps.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Snakes!\"\n\n\"Are you afraid of snakes, Alf?\"\n\n\"Some kinds.\"\n\n\"What kinds?\"\n\n\"Well, rattlers, f'r instance.\"\n\n\"There are none of that kind on this part of the Indian Smoke\nRange,\" Reade rejoined.  \"Come along with me.\"\n\nThere was something mildly though surely compelling in Tom's\nmanner.  Alf Drew went along, though he didn't wish to.  The two\nwere just at the fringe of the thick underbrush when there came\na warning sound just ahead of them.\n\nClick! cl-cl-click!\n\n\"Whee!  Me for outer this!\" gasped Alf, going whiter than ever\nas he turned.  But Tom caught him by the shoulder.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" demanded Reade.\n\nClick cl-cl-click!\n\n\"There it is again,\" cried Alf, in fear.\n\n\"What on earth are you talking about?\" Tom demanded.\n\nOnce more the dread sound smote the air.\n\n\"Rattlers!\" wailed Drew, perspiring from fear.  \"Lemme get away\nfrom this.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" retorted Reade, retaining a strong clutch on the boy's\nshoulder, though once more the sound reached their ears.\n\n\"It's all your nerves, Alf,\" Tom insisted.  \"You just imagine such\nthings.  That's what cigarettes do to your nerves.\"\n\n\"But don't you hear the rattlesnake?\"\n\n\"I don't,\" Tom gravely informed him, though once more the\nnerve-disturbing sound rose clearly on the air.  \"See here, Alf,\nrattlers, whatever their habits, certainly don't climb trees.  I'll\nput you up on that limb.\"\n\nTom's strong young arms lifted Alf easily until he could clutch\nat the lowest limb of a tree.\n\n\"Climb up there and sit down,\" Reade ordered.  Drew sat on the limb,\nshaking with terror.\n\n\"Now, I'll show you that there isn't a snake anywhere in that\nclump of brush,\" Tom proposed, and forthwith stepped into the\nthicket, beating about lustily with his heavy boots.\n\n\"L-l-l-look out!\" shivered Drew.  \"You'll be bitten!\"\n\n\"Nonsense, I tell you.  There isn't a rattler anywhere on this\npart of the Range.  It's your nerves, Alf.  Cigarettes are destroying\n'em.  There!  I've beaten up every bit of this brush and you see\nthat I've not been bitten.  Now I'll help you down to the ground,\nand you want to get a good, steadying grip on your nerves.\"\n\nAlf Drew permitted himself to be helped to the ground.  No sooner,\nhowever, had his feet touched the earth than there came that ominous\nrattling sound.\n\n\"There, you big idiot!\" howled Alf. \"There it is again!\"\n\n\"Just your bad nerves, Alf,\" Tom smiled.  \"They're so bad that I'll\noverlook your lack of respect calling me an idiot!\"\n\n\"Don't you s'pose I know rattlers when I hear 'em?\" asked Drew,\nsullenly.  \"I was almost bitten by one once, and that's why I'm so\nafraid of 'em.\"\n\n\"I _was_ bitten once,\" Tom replied.  \"Yet you see that I'm not very\nnervous about them, especially in a part of the country where\nnone are ever found.  It's your nerves, Alf---and cigarettes!\"\n\n\"I wish I had one now,\" sighed the younger boy.\n\n\"A rattlesnake?\" Tom inquired innocently.\n\n\"No---of course not!  A cigarette.\"\n\n\"But you're going to forget those soul-destroying little coffin-nails,\"\nReade suggested.  \"You're going to become a man and act like one.\nYou're going to learn how much more fun it is to have your lungs\nfilled with pure air instead of stifling cigarette smoke.\"\n\n\"Maybe I am!\" muttered the boy.\n\n\"Oh, yes; I'm sure of it,\" said Reade cheerfully.\n\nCl-cl-cl-click!\n\n\"O-o-o-ow!\" shrilled Alf, jumping at least two feet.\n\n\"Now, what's the matter with you?\" inquired Tom in feigned astonishment.\n\n\"Don't tell me you didn't hear the rattler just now,\" cried young\nDrew fiercely.\n\n\"No; I didn't,\" Tom assured him.  \"And how could we find a\nrattler--_here_?  We're crossing open ground now.  There is no place\nwithin three hundred feet of us for a rattlesnake to move without our\nseeing him.\"\n\nCl-cl-cl-click!\n\nAlf Drew held back, trembling.\n\n\"I'm not going forward another step,\" he insisted.  \"This ground\nis full of rattlers.\"\n\n\"Let's go back to camp, then, if your nerves are so unstrung,\"\nReade proposed.\n\nThey turned, starting backward.  Again the warning rattle sounded,\nseemingly just in front of Alf, though there was no place for a snake\nto conceal itself nearby.\n\nAlf, however, turned paler still, halted and started off at right\nangles to his former course.  Again the rattle sounded.\n\n\"Hear that snake?\" demanded young Drew.\n\n\"No; and there isn't one,\" Tom assured him.  \"Why will you be so\nfoolish---so nervous?  In other words, why do you destroy your five\nsenses with cigarettes in this fashion?\"\n\nCl-cl-click!\n\nAlf Drew halted, trembling so that he could hardly stand.\n\n\"I'm going to quit camp---going to get out of this place,\" he\nshivered.  \"The ground is full of rattlers.  O-o-o-oh!  There's\nanother tuning up.\"\n\nTom laughed covertly.  The disturbing sound came again.\n\n\"I never saw a place like this part of the range,\" Alf all but\nsobbed, his breath catching.  \"Oh, won't I be glad to see a city\nagain!\"\n\n\"Just so you can find a store where you can buy cigarettes?\" Tom\nReade queried.\n\n\"I wish I had one, now,\" moaned the young victim.  \"It would steady\nme.\"\n\n\"The last ones that you smoked didn't appear to steady you,\" the\nyoung engineer retorted.  \"Just see how unstrung you are.  Every\nstep you take you imagine you hear rattlers sounding their warning.\"\n\n\"Do you tell me, on your sacred honor,\" proposed Alf, \"that you\nhaven't heard a single rattler this afternoon?\"\n\n\"I give you my most solemn word that I haven't,\" Tom answered.\n\"Come, come, Alf!  What you want to do is to shake off the trembles.\nLet me take your arm.  Now, walk briskly with me.  Inflate your\nchest with all the air you can get in as we go along.  Just wait\nand see if that isn't the way to shake off these horrid cigarette\ndreams.\"\n\nSomething in Reade's vigorous way of speaking made Alf Drew obey.\nTom put him over the ground at as good a gait as he judged the\ncigarette victim would be able to keep up.\n\nReaders of the preceding volumes of this series, and of other,\nearlier series, need not the slightest introduction to Tom Reade\nand Harry Hazelton.  Our readers of the \"_Grammar School Series_\"\nknow Tom and Harry as two of the members of that famous sextette\nof schoolboy athletes who, under the leadership of Dick Prescott,\nwere known as Dick & Co.\n\nIn the \"_High School Boys Series_,\" too, our readers have followed\nthe fortunes of Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton, through all their\ntriumphs on football fields, on baseball diamonds and in all the\nschool sports.\n\nDick Prescott and Greg Holmes succeeded in winning appointments\nto the United States military Academy, and their adventures are\nfully set forth in the \"_West Point Series_.\"\n\nDave Darrin and Dan Dalzell \"made\" the United States Naval Academy\nat Annapolis, and what befell them there has been fully set forth\nin the \"_Annapolis Series_.\"\n\nReade and Harry Hazelton elected to go through life as civil engineers.\nIn \"_The Young Engineers in Colorado_\" has been fully set forth\nthe extraordinary work of these young men at railroad building\nthrough the mountains wilds.  In \"_The Young Engineers in Arizona_\"\nwe have followed Tom and Harry through even more startling adventures,\nand have seen how they handled even greater problems in engineering.\n\nUp to date the careers of these two bright young men had not been\nhumdrum ones.  The surroundings in which their professional lives\nhad been passed had been such as to supply them with far more\nstartling adventures than either young man had ever looked for.\n\nAnd now they were in Nevada, the state famous for its gold and silver\nmines.  Yet they had come ere solely in search of a few weeks of rest.\nRest?  There was anything but rest immediately ahead of the young\nengineers, but the curtain had not been lifted.\n\nImmediately after the completion of their great work in Arizona,\nTom Reade and Harry Hazelton had gone back east to the good old\nhome town of Gridley.  While there they had encountered Dick Prescott\nand Greg Holmes, their old school chums, at that time cadets at\nthe United States Military Academy.  The doings of the four old\nchums at that time in Gridley are set forth fully in \"_Dick Prescott's\nThird Year At West Point_.\"\n\nDuring the weeks spent East, Tom and Harry had taken almost their\nfirst steps in the study of metallurgy.  They had succeed in mastering\nthe comparatively simple art of assaying gold and silver.\n\nSo now, with the summer past, we find our young engineers out in\nNevada, taking a little more rest just because no new engineering\ntask of sufficient importance had presented itself.\n\n\"If we're going to be engineers out West, though, Harry, we simply\nmust know a good deal about assaying precious metals,\" Tom had\ndeclared.\n\nSo, though the chums were \"taking a rest,\" as they phrased it, they\nhad brought with them a small furnace and the rest of the outfit for\nassaying minerals in small quantities.\n\nToday, however, was altogether too fine for thoughts of work.  Just\nafter breakfast Harry Hazelton had borrowed the only horse in camp,\nbelonging to Jim Ferrers, their cook and guide, and had ridden away\nfor the day.\n\nBarely had Hazelton departed when Alf Drew, hungry, lonely and\nwistful, had happened along.  He asked for \"a job.\"  There really\nwasn't one for him, but good-natured Reade created one, offering\nfive dollars a month and board.\n\n\"No telling, young man, how long the job will last,\" Tom warned him.\n\"We may at any hour break camp and get away.\"\n\nBut Alf had taken the job and gratefully.  Not until after the noon\nmeal had the little fellow revealed his unfortunate vice for\ncigarette smoking.\n\n\"You've simply got to give up that habit, Alf\" Tom urged, as they\nwalked along.\n\n\"You can't make me,\" retorted young Drew.  \"You've no right to.\"\n\n\"No, I haven't,\" Tom admitted soberly.  \"If I had any real rights\nover you I'm afraid I'd turn you over my knee and spank you, three\ntimes a day, until you gave up the beastly habit.\"\n\n\"You're not going to bounce me, are you?\" asked Alf.\n\n\"No; I'll keep you here as long as we can use a boy.  But, mark\nme, Alf, somehow, and before very long, I'm going to break you\nfrom your cigarettes.  I don't know how I'm going to do it, but I'm\ngoing to do it just the same!\"\n\nAlf Drew looked uncommonly solemn, but he said nothing.\n\nFor five minutes more they walked on, then came suddenly out from\nunder a line of trees and stood at the edge of a low cliff, gazing\ndown in astonishment at the gully below them.\n\n\"What on earth-----\" began Tom Reade, in amazement.\n\n\"Let's scoot!\" begged Alf tremulously.  \"There's going to be some\nkilling right down there!\"\n\nIt certainly looked that way.\n\nIn the gully three automobiles, showing the effects of long travel\nover hard roads, stood close together.  More than a dozen people,\nall but two of whom were dressed in \"eastern\" clothes, stood by the\nmachines.  Two of the party were women, and one a girl of twelve.\n\nThe two men who belonged to the party, but did not appear to be\n\"eastern,\" had drawn revolvers, and now stood facing four\nsullen-looking men who stood with the butts of their rifles resting\non the ground.\n\n\"Gracious!  We can't have any shooting with women and children\nstanding around to get hit!\" gasped Tom Reade.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTROUBLE BREWS ON THE TRAIL\n\n\nSo silent had been the approach of Tom and his waif companion\nthat those below had not perceived them.\n\nMoreover, judging from the expressions on the faces of the people\nalmost at Reade's feet, they were all too deeply absorbed in their\nown business to have any eyes or ears for outside matters.\n\nThrough the scene below was one of armed truce that might, at any\nmoment, break into hostilities, with human lives at stake, Tom\nglanced coolly downward for a few seconds after his first startled,\nunheard remark.\n\n\"I'm going, to duck out of this,\" whispered Alf Drew, whose slim\nlittle figure was shaking in a way suggestive of chills.\n\n\"Don't be in a hurry,\" Tom murmured.  \"We may be of some use to\nsome of these people.\"\n\n\"Tote those guns away, friends,\" spoke one of the revolver-armed\nmen with the automobile party, \"and march yourselves under the\nguns.  Remember, we have women here.\"\n\n\"They can get away,\" returned one of the sullen-faced men with rifles.\n\"We won't hinder 'em.  We'll give 'em two full minutes to get where\nit's safe.  Then we're going to turn our talking machines loose.\"\n\nFrom the top of the low cliff came Tom Meade's drawling voice:\n\n\"Oh, I say, friends!\"\n\nStartled, all below glanced quickly upward.\n\n\"There seems to be trouble down there,\" Tom suggested.\n\n\"There sure is,\" nodded one of the armed men with the automobile\nparty.\n\n\"Now, it's too glorious a day to spoil it with fighting,\" Reade\nwent on.  \"Can't we arbitrate?\"\n\n\"The first move for you, young man,\" warned one of the four men,\nraising his rifle, \"is to face about and git outer here.\"\n\n\"Not while there are women and children present who might get hurt,\"\nTom dissented, with a shake of his head.\n\n\"Git, I tell you!\" shouted the man, now aiming his rifle full at\nTom's chest.  Git---before I count five.\"\n\n\"Save your cartridge,\" proposed Tom.  \"I'm too poor game, and\nI'm not armed, either.  Surely you wouldn't shoot a harmless orphan\nlike me.\"  Saying which the young engineer, having found a path down\nthe cliff nearby, started slowly to descend.\n\n\"Get back there!  Another step, and I'll put a ball through you!\"\nroared the man who had Reade covered with his rifle.\n\n\"That wouldn't prove anything but your marksmanship,\" Suggested Tom,\nand coolly continued to descend.\n\n\"Going to get back?\" howled the man behind the gun.\n\nWithout further answer Reade quickened his pace somewhat, reaching\nthe flat bottom of the gully on a run.\n\nThough he felt that the chances were eight out of ten that he would\nbe shot at any second, Tom didn't betray any outward fear.  The\ntruth was that even if he wanted to stop, he would have found it\nsomewhat difficult on that steep incline.\n\nWhere he landed, on his feet, Tom stood between the hostile parties.\nHad hostilities opened at that moment he would have been in a bad\nposition between the two fires.\n\n\"Great Scott!\" gasped the frightened Alf, peering down.\n\nThat youngster had thrown himself flat on his stomach his head\nbehind a bush.  He was trying to make himself as small as possible.\n\"Whew!  But Reade has the real grit!\"\n\nFirst of all Tom gazed curiously at the four men, who glared back at\nhim with looks full of hate.\n\n\"Who are you, anyway?\" demanded the spokesman of the sullen four.\n\n\"I might be the sheriff,\" Tom replied placidly.\n\n\"Huh!\" retorted the spokesman.\n\n\"But I'm not,\" Tom went on, rather genially.  \"I'm just an inquisitive\ntourist.\"\n\n\"Heard o' Bald Knob?\" demanded the leader of the four.\n\n\"No,\" admitted Reade, opening his eyes with interest.  \"Who is he,\nand how did he become bald?\"\n\n\"Bald Knob is a place,\" came the information.  \"It's the place where\ninquisitive tourists are buried in these parts.\"\n\n\"I'll look it up some day,\" Tom promised, good-humoredly.\n\n\"You'll look it up before dark if we have time to pack you there,\"\ngrowled the leader of the men.  \"Now, are you going to stand aside?\"\n\nTom shook his head.\n\n\"Let's shake hands all around and then sit down for a nice little\ntalk,\" the young engineer suggested.\n\n\"There's been too much talk already,\" snarled Tom's antagonist.\n\nThe men of the automobile party were silent.  They had scented\nin Tom an ally who would help their cause materially.\n\n\"Then you won't be sociable?\" Reade demanded, as if half offended.\n\n\"Git out and go about your business,\" ordered the leader of the\nfour men.\n\n\"It's always my business when women and children appear to be in\ndanger,\" returned Tom.  He turned on his heel, presenting his\nbroad back as a target to the rifles as he stepped over to automobile\nparty.\n\nOddly the four men, though they had the look of being desperate, did\nnot offer to shoot.\n\nTom's audacity had almost cowed them for the moment.\n\n\"I hope I can be of some use to you,\" suggested Tom, raising his\nhat out of respect to the women.\n\n\"I reckon you can, if you're a good hand with a gun,\" replied the\nolder of the two armed men with the motor party.  \"Got any shooting\nirons about you?\"\n\n\"Nothing in that line,\" Tom admitted.\n\n\"Then reach under the cushion, left-hand front seat of that car,\"\nreturned the same speaker.  \"You'll find an automatic revolver\nthere.\"\n\nReade, however, chose to ignore the advice.  He had small taste for\nthe use of firearms.\n\nSeeing, the young engineer's reluctance the younger of the two\narmed men went himself to the car, taking out the revolver and\noffering it to this cool young stranger.\n\n\"Thank you,\" was Tom's smiling reply.  \"But that tool is not for\nme.  I'm the two-hundred-and-thirteenth vice president of the\nPeace Society.\"\n\n\"You'd better fight, or hike,\" advised the older of the two men.\n\"This isn't going to be a safe place for just nothing but chin.\nAnd, ladies, I ask you to get behind one of the cars, since you\nwon't leave here.  Throw yourselves flat on your faces.  We don't\nwant any good women hit by any such mean rascals as that crowd\nover there.\"\n\nThe men with the rifles scowled dangerously.\n\n\"Now, listen to me---all hands,\" begged Tom, raising his right hand.\n\"It's none of my business, as I very well know, but may I inquire\nwhat all this trouble is about?\"\n\nA rather portly, well dressed and well-groomed man of sixty, who\nhad been leaning against the side of one of the cars, now spoke\nup promptly enough:\n\n\"I am head of the company that has legally staked out a claim\nhere, young man.  Ours is a mining company.  The men yonder say\nthat they own the claim---that they found it first, and that it\nis theirs.  However, they never staked it off---never filed their\nclaim.\"\n\n\"It's our claim, just the same,\" spoke up the at the four men.\n\"And we won't have it jumped by any gang of tenderfeet on earth.\nSo get out of here, all of you, or the music will start at once.\nWe don't want to hit any woman or children, but we're going to\nhold our own property.  If the women and the child won't get out\nof here, then they'll have to take their chances.\"\n\n\"That's the case, and the line of action!\" growled another of\nthe men.\n\n\"But let me ask you men,\" continued Tom, facing the quartette, \"do\nyou claim that you ever made legal entry of your asserted title here?\"\n\n\"Maybe we didn't,\" grunted the spokesman.  But we've known of\nthis place for 'most a year Today we came to settle here, stake\noff our claims, file our entry and begin living here.  But we\nfound these benzine trotters on the ground.\n\n\"But these people state that they have made legal claim here,\" Tom\nurged.\n\n\"We have,\" insisted the portly man in black.\n\n\"If there is any dispute over the facts, my friends,\" Tom continued,\nturning once more to the four men, \"then it looks like a case for the\ncourts to settle.  But if these people, who appear to be from the\nEast, have acquired legal title here then they'll be able to hold it,\nand you four men are only intruders here.  Why, the matter begins to\nlook rather clear---even for a Nevada dispute.\"\n\n\"These folks are going to move, or we'll topple 'em over and move\n'em ourselves,\" insisted the leader.\n\n\"Men,\" rejoined Reade, \"I'm afraid you're not cool enough to settle\nthis case fairly.  We'll call in a few of the neighbors and try to\nget the facts of the case.  We'll-----\"\n\n\"Neighbors?\" jeered the leader of the quartette.  \"Where are you\ngoing to find any?\"\n\n\"Right near at hand,\" Tom proposed.  \"Much nearer than you think.\nDrew!\"\n\nAlf still lay behind the bush near the edge of the cliff.  He\nwas still present mainly because he had not courage enough to\nrun away.\n\n\"Drew!\" Tom repeated, this time speaking sharply, for he guessed\nthat the cigarette fiend was shaking in his boots.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" piped the faltering voice of Alf.\n\n\"Drew, run to camp as fast as you can.  Tell Ferrers to bring\nthe whole crowd over at once.\"\n\nAlf was astounded by this staggering command, which sounded like\nan order to rush an army to the spot.  Yet he managed to gasp:\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Now, go!  Make fast time.  Don't let any of this outfit catch\nyou and hinder you.\"\n\n\"No, sir!\"\n\nThis time Alf Drew's voice sounded faintly, over his shoulder\nfrom a considerable distance, for the boy was running fast, fear\nlending speed his feet.\n\n\"You see,\" Tom went on coolly, standing so that he could face\nboth factions in this quarrel, \"I don't know much about the merits\nof the case, and I'm a stranger here.  I don't want to be accused\nof being too fresh, so I've sent for some of the natives.  They'll\nknow, better than just what to advise here.  It won't take 'em\nlong to get here.\"\n\nTom wound up this last statement with a cheerful smile.\n\n\"So Jim Ferrers is over in your camp, is he?\" demanded the leader\nof the four men.\n\n\"Yes,\" Tom assented affably.  \"Do you know him?\"\n\n\"Maybe.\"\n\n\"Jim is a fine fellow,\" Reade went on warmly.  \"He knows all about\nNevada, too, and he's a man of good judgment.  He'll be a lot of\nuse to us in getting at the rights of this case.\"\n\n\"There's only one right side,\" insisted the leader of the quartette.\n\n\"So my friend here has informed me,\" answered Reade, nodding in\nthe direction of the stout man in black.  \"Yet there seems to\nbe a good deal of difference in opinion as to which is really\nthe right side.  But just wait until Jim and his friends get here.\nThey'll be able to set us all straight and there won't be any\nneed for doing any rough work like shooting.\"\n\n\"Dolph, we'd better shoot up the whole crowd, including the cheeky\nyoung one, before Jim Ferrers and his crowd gits here,\" propose\none of the quartette.\n\n\"Jim Ferrers will be awfully displeased, you do,\" drawled Tom.\n\"Do you know Jim?  He has a reputation, I believe, for being\nrather sore on folks who shoot up his friends.\"\n\n\"I'll do it for you, anyway, kid!\" growled one of the four, leveling\nhis rifle.\n\nBut their leader struck the weapon up angrily just before the\nshot barked out.\n\n\"Who's having Fourth of July around here?\" called a laughing voice\nfrom some distance down the rising path at the rear of the quartette.\nThe four men turned quickly, but Tom had recognized joyfully\nthe tones of Harry Hazelton's voice.\n\n\"You keep out of here, stranger!\" ordered one of the quartette\ngruffly.\n\n\"Don't you do anything of the sort, Harry!\" roared Reade's voice.\n\"You keep right on an join us.\"\n\n\"Did you hear my advice?\" insisted the leader of the four, holding\nhis rifle as though would throw the butt to his shoulder.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Hazelton, calmly, \"but I also heard my senior partner's\norder.  He and I stick together.  Gangway, please.\"\n\nHarry was cool enough as he rode his horse at a walk past the\nmen.  Hazelton will never understand how near death he was at\nthat moment.  But there had been a few whispered words between\nthe men, and they had allowed him to ride by.\n\n\"What's the game here, Tom?\" Harry called cheerily.  \"Any real\nexcitement going on?\"\n\n\"No.\" Tom shook his head.  \"Just a little misunderstanding over\na question of fact.\"\n\n\"Then I see that the lie hasn't been passed,\" grinned Hazelton.\n\"The ground isn't littered at all.\"\n\nHe rode up to his chum, displaying no curiosity.\n\nThat the automobile party had been much cheered by the arrival\nof the young engineers was wholly apparent.  For the same reason\nthe four men appeared to be a good deal less certain of themselves.\n\n\"I guess there isn't going to be any real trouble,\" spoke Reade\ncarelessly.  \"But there's a question at issue that I feel it would\nbe impertinent in me to try to settle, so I've sent for Jim Ferrers\nto bring over the whole crowd.\"\n\nThough Harry couldn't imagine where Ferrers's \"crowd\" was, he wisely\nheld his tongue.\n\nAt the same time an earnest conference was going on among the\nfour men.  They spoke in low whispers.\n\n\"Jim Ferrers, alone, we could handle,\" declared the leader.  \"But\nif Jim has a crowd back of him things won't go our way when it come\nto the shooting.\"\n\n\"Let's start it before Ferrers's party gets here,\" growled another\nof the sullen ones.\n\n\"We would be tracked down and shot at by Ferrers and a crowd,\"\nargued the leader.  \"Things are too warm for us here, just now.\nIn a case like this remember that a fellow lasts longer when\nhe does his shooting from ambush and at his own time.  We won't\nlet this Dunlop crowd fool us out of our rights, but we'll have\nto choose a better time---and fight from ambush at that.\"\n\nIt was soon plain that this view prevailed among the quartette.\nAs they turned to move away, the leader remarked:\n\n\"We'll leave you for a while, Dunlop, but don't image you've won.\nDon't get any notion that you'll ever win.  You'll hear from us\nagain.\"\n\n\"And you'll hear a plenty as long as your hearing remains good,\"\nsnarled another of the men.\n\nThe four disturbers, turning their backs, started down the sloping\ntrail.\n\n\"Oh, but I'm glad we've seen the last of them!\" shuddered one\nof the women of the Dunlop party.\n\n\"Don't be deceived into thinking that the last has been seen of\nthat crew, madam,\" spoke Tom Reade gently.  \"Those fellows will\nbe heard from again, and at no very distant hour, either.  Mr.\nDunlop---I believe that is your name, sir?\"\n\nThe stout man bowed.\n\n\"Mr. Dunlop,\" Reade went on, earnestly, \"I urge you to get these\nwomen and the child away from here as soon as you can.  Also any\nof the men who may happen to have no taste for fighting.  I don't\nbelieve you'll see those four men in the open any more, but there'll\nbe more than one shot fired from ambush.  You surely won't expose\nthese women and the child any further!\"\n\n\"But, Father,\" broke in one of the women, tremulously, \"if we leave,\nit will take one of your two fighting men to run the car.  Think how\nweak that will leave your defense.\"\n\n\"You forget, my dear,\" spoke Mr. Dunlop, gently, \"that our newly-found\nyoung friends have just sent for other men.\"\n\nTom smiled grimly as he thought of Jim Ferrers's \"crowd\"---consisting\nof poor, frighten little Alf with the cigarette-stained fingers.\n\n\"At any cost or risk, sir,\" Tom went on, after a moment, \"you must\nget the women and the child away from here.  But---why, where is\nthe child?\"\n\nThere was an instant of dismay.  The little girl had vanished.\n\n\"Gladys!\" spoke Dr. Dunlop's daughter in alarm.\n\nFrom under one of the cars a muffled voice answered, \"Here I am.\"\nThen Gladys, sobbing and shaking, emerged into view.\n\n\"I was so frightened!\" cried the child.  \"I just had to hide.\"\n\n\"The men have gone away, dear,\" explained her mother soothingly.\n\"And now we're going too.  We'll be safe after this.\"\n\nAt that instant three shots, fired in rapid succession, rang out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nJIM'S \"ARMY\" APPEARS\n\n\n\"Down on your faces!\" called the older of the armed men with the\nmotor party.\n\n\"Not necessary,\" spoke Tom, dryly.  \"The shots were fired by Jim\nFerrers's army.\"\n\n\"And I missed the pesky critter, too!\" spoke Jim's voice, resentfully,\nas he showed his head over the edge of the cliff, where three puffs\nof smoke slowly ascended.\n\n\"Don't show yourself, Jim!  Careful!\" Reade warned their guide.\n\n\"It's all right,\" declared Ferrers indifferently, as he rose to his\nfull height, then discovered the path by which Tom had descended.\n\"The critters took to cover as soon as they heard me making a noise.\"\n\nWith that explanation Ferrers slid rather than walked down into the\ngully.\n\n\"Where are the rest of your men?\" questioned Mr. Dunlop, eagerly.\n\n\"I'm all there are,\" explained Jim, \"except one pesky little puffer\nof cigarettes.  He's hiding his stained fingers somewhere in the\nbrush half a mile from here.\"\n\n\"There are no more men to your crowd?\" spoke Dr. Dunlop anxiously.\n\n\"None,\" Tom broke in.  \"My order to the boy, Drew, was intended\nby way of conversation to interest your four callers.\"\n\n\"Then, indeed, we must look out for an ambush,\" said one of Mr.\nDunlop's companions, a man of thirty.\n\n\"And you will be in real danger every minute of the time,\" said\nDunlop's daughter, fearfully.  \"Father, why can't you come out\nof this wild country?  Is the money that you may make out here worth\nall the risk?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Mr. Dunlop, with a firmness that seemed intended\nto settle the matter.\n\n\"Why did you fire on those men without provocation?\" Tom asked,\naside, of Jim Ferrers, who stood stroking his rifle barrel with one\nhand.\n\n\"I had provocation,\" Ferrers answered.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Reade, who was none the wiser.\n\n\"I'll 'get' Dolph Gage yet, if I ever have a fair chance without\nrunning my neck into the noose of the law,\" added Ferrers, with\nsilent fury in his tone.\n\n\"Is there a story behind it all, eh\" queried Tom mildly.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Reade.  Too long a story to tell in a minute.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to pry into your affairs, Ferrers,\" Tom made haste\nto say.\n\n\"Well, for one thing, Dolph Gage shot the only brother I ever\nhad---and got cleared of the charge in the court!\" muttered Ferrers.\n\n\"Was your brother killed?\" Tom inquired.\n\n\"Didn't I state that Dolph Gage shot him?\" demanded Jim in a\nsemi-injured tone.  \"Men don't often waste ammunition out in this\ncounty, even if I did send in three wild shots just now.  But that\nwas because I was excited, and couldn't see straight.  I'll try to\ndo better next time.\"\n\nMr. Dunlop was now engaged in making his daughter, her child and\nthe other woman comfortable in one of the touring cars.\n\nSeveral of the men in the party, also, had decided that they did not\ncare to remain if they were to be exposed to shooting at all hours\nof the day.\n\nIn the end Mr. Dunlop had but three of the men in his party left\nwith him.\n\nThe younger of the two armed men was sent to drive the car containing\nthe women.  One of the guests of the Dunlop party drove a second\ncar.  In this order they started for Dugout City, thirty miles\naway.  As the roads hardly deserved the name the motor cars would\nnot be likely to reach Dugout before dark.\n\n\"Look out for ambushes,\" exclaimed Mr. Dunlop, to the armed driver\nof the women's car.\n\n\"Yes, sir; but there isn't much danger of our being fired on.  Gage's\ngang will be only too glad to see the women folks leaving here.  We\nwon't be troubled.\"\n\nMr. Dunlop stood anxiously gazing after the two touring cars as\nlong as they could be seen.  Then he stepped briskly back, holding\nout his hand to Tom Reade.\n\n\"Permit me, now, to thank you for your timely aid,\" said the stout\nman.  \"You know my name.  Will you kindly introduce your friends?\"\n\nThis Tom did at once, after which Mr. Dunlop presented his three\ncompanions.  One was his nephew, Dave Hill, the second, George\nParkinson, Mr. Dunlop's secretary, and the third a man named John\nRansome, an investor in Mr. Dunlop's mining enterprise.  The elder\nof the armed men who remained behind was Joe Timmins, both guide\nand chauffeur.  The young man who had gone with one of the cars\nwas Timmins's son.\n\n\"You have a mining claim hereabouts, Mr. Dunlop?\" Tom inquired.\n\n\"Yes; but not exactly at this point,\" added the older man, with\na smile as he noted Reade staring about him with a quizzical smile.\n\"The claim stands over there on that slope\"--- pointing to the\nwestward.\n\n\"Has it been prospected, sir?\" asked Hazelton.\n\n\"Yes: it's a valuable property, all right.  I brought my party\nout here to show it to them.  The friends who have returned to\nDugout, and Mr. Ransome here, have the money ready to put up the\nneeded capital as soon as they are satisfied.\"\n\n\"I'm satisfied now,\" spoke up Ransome, \"and I'm sure that the\nothers are, after what Mr. Dunlop showed us this morning.\"\n\n\"How soon do you begin operations?\" Tom asked with interest.\n\n\"As soon as my men have talked it over and have concluded to put\nup the money, replied Mr. Dunlop.\n\n\"We're ready, now---all of us,\" Ransome broke in.\n\n\"Then,\" said Mr. Dunlop, \"the next step will be to get in touch\nwith a satisfactory engineer.  You see, Mr. Reade, it's either\na tunneling or a boring claim.  We must either sink a shaft or\ndrive a tunnel---whichever operation can be done at the least\ncost.  Either way will be expensive, and we must find out for\na certainty which will be the cheaper.  There's a lot of refractory\nrock in the slope yonder.  In the morning our party will get all\nthe ore we can from the surface croppings, then start for Dugout,\ngoing from there to Carson City.  At Carson we hope to find an\nhonest engineer and a capable metallurgist.\"\n\n\"Then you haven't engaged any engineer?\" Reade asked, almost eagerly.\n\n\"Not yet.  There was no need, until we had satisfied the investors.\"\n\n\"Perhaps Hazelton and I can make some deal with you, Mr. Dunlop,\"\nReade proposed.\n\n\"In what line?\" inquired Dunlop.  \"Are you miners---or machinists?\"\n\n\"When we want to be really kind to ourselves,\" smiled Tom, \"we call\nourselves engineers.\"\n\n\"Mining engineers?\" demanded Mr. Dunlop, gazing at the two youths\nin astonishment.\n\n\"No, sir.  Neither Hazelton nor myself ever handled a mine yet,\" Tom\nanswered.  \"But we have done a lot of railroad work.\"\n\n\"Railroad work isn't mine digging,\" objected Mr. Dunlop.\n\n\"I'm aware of that, sir,\" Tom agreed.  \"Yet boring is largely\nexcavation work; so is tunneling.  We've had charge of considerable\nexcavating in our services to railroads.\"\n\n\"Very likely,\" nodded Dunlop, reflectively.  But how about the\nassays for gold and silver?  Sometimes, when searching for drifts\nand runs of the metal we may need a dozen assays in a single week.\"\n\n\"We have the furnace with us, sir; the assay balance and all the\ntools and chemicals that are used in an ordinary assay.\"\n\n\"You have?\" asked Mr. Dunlop.  \"Then you must have come prepared\nto go into this line of work.\"\n\n\"We thought it more than likely that we'd amuse ourselves along\nthat line of work for a while,\" Tom explained truthfully.  \"Yet\nmining attracts us.  We'd stay here and go into the thing in earnest\nif we could make good enough terms with you.\"\n\n\"Would seventy-five dollars a month for each of you be satisfactory?\"\nasked Mr. Dunlop keenly.\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied Reade with emphasis.  \"Nor would we take a\nhundred and seventy-five dollars, either.  When I said that we\nwould consider a good proposition I meant just that, sir.\"\n\n\"Hm-m-m-m!\" murmured Mr. Dunlop.  \"I shall have to give this matter\nthought, and question you a good deal more on your qualifications.\nI suppose you would be willing to let this matter remain open for\na few days?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir; we are in no hurry.  However, until we are definitely\nengaged we do not bind ourselves to be ready for your work.\"\n\n\"Where is your camp?\" said Mr. Dunlop.\n\nJim Ferrers explained the easiest way of reaching the camp in a motor\ncar.\n\n\"And I'd advise you to come to our camp, too,\" Tom added.  \"You'll\nbe safer there than here.\"\n\n\"But we would; expose you to danger, too,\" Mr. Dunlop objected.\n\n\"We're rather used to danger,\" smiled Tom placidly.  \"In fact, just\na little of danger makes us feel that we're getting more enjoyment\nout of life.\"\n\n\"Do you think it a good plan to take up the invitation of these\ngentlemen, Timmins?\" inquired Mr. Dunlop.\n\n\"It's the safest thing you can do, sir,\" answered Joe Timmins.\n\n\"We'll start back, now,\" proposed Tom.  \"If you don't drive too\nfast you'll give us a chance to reach our camp in time to welcome\nyou.\"\n\n\"You start now, and we'll start within ten minutes,\" proposed\nMr. Dunlop.\n\nThis being agreed to, Tom, Harry and Ferrers began the task of\nclimbing the cliff path.  At last they reached the top, then started\nat long strides toward camp, Ferrers's horse having been surrendered\nby Harry to Dave Hill.\n\n\"Who knows,\" laughed Tom, \"we may become mining engineers here\nin Nevada\"\n\n\"Small chance of it,\" Harry rejoined.  \"In opinion Mr. Dunlop is\na good enough fellow, but he's accustomed to making all the money\nhimself.  He'd want us at about a hundred dollars a month apiece.\"\n\n\"He can want, then,\" Tom retorted.  \"Yet, somehow, I've an idea\nThat Mr. Dunlop will turn to be generous if he decides that we're\nthe engineers for him.\"\n\nFor some minutes the trio tramped on silently, in Indian file,\nFerrers leading.\n\n\"Hello, Alf!\" bellowed Tom through the woods, as they neared their\ncamp site.  No answer came.\n\n\"Where did you leave the little fellow, Jim?\" inquired Reade.\n\n\"I didn't notice which way he went, sir,\" returned the guide.\n\"He looked plumb scared, and I reckon he ducked into cover somewhere.\nMaybe he headed for Dugout City and hasn't stopped running yet.\"\n\nThen a turn of the path under the trees brought them in sight of\ntheir camp.\n\nRather, where the camp had been.  Jim Ferrers rubbed his eyes for\nan instant, for the tents had been spirited away as though by magic.\nNor were the cots to be seen.  Blankets lay strewn about on the\nground.  A quarter the camp's food supplies was still left, and\nthat was all.\n\n\"Is it magic, Jim?\" gasped puzzled Tom Reade.\n\n\"No, sir; just plain stealing,\" Ferrers responded grimly.\n\n\"Then who-----\"\n\n\"Dolph Gage's crew, I'll be bound, sir.  They don't want you two\nhanging around in this country, and they want me a heap sight\nless.  But maybe we'll show 'em!  The trail can't be hard to find.\nWe'll have to start at once.\"\n\n\"After we've seen and spoken to Mr. Dunlop,\" Tom amended.  \"We\ncan't run off without explanation to the guests that we have invited\nto share the camp that we thought had.\"\n\nBarely a hundred yards away four men lay on their stomachs, heads\nconcealed behind a low fringe of brush under which the muzzles\nof their rifles peeped.\n\n\"Remember,\" whispered Dolph Gage faintly, \"all of you fire your first\nshot into Jim Ferrers.  After that we'll take charge of the\nyoungsters!  Get a close bead on Jim.  Ready!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nSOLD OUT FOR A TOY BALE!\n\n\nJim Ferrers had stated a plain truth when he remarked that Nevada\nmen did not often waste ammunition.\n\nWith four rifles aimed at him, at that short, point-blank range,\nit would seem that Jim's last moment had come.\n\nYet at that instant the sound of an approaching motor ear was heard.\n\nThen the car, moving at twelve miles an hour mounted the crest at a\npoint less than seventy yards from where the four ambushed men lay.\n\nJoe Timmins caught sight of them.\n\n\"Take the wheel!\" muttered Timmins, forcing Parkinson's nearer\nhand to the wheel.\n\nIn an instant Joe was upon his feet, drawing his revolver.  He\nfired at the men in ambush, but a lurch of the car on the rough\nground destroyed his aim.\n\n\"Dolph Gage and his rascals at the ridge,\" bellowed Joe, in a\nfog-horn voice, pointing.\n\nJim Ferrers dropped to the ground, hugging it flat.  Harry followed\nsuit.  Tom Reade hesitated an instant, then away he flew at a\ndead run.\n\nClose to a tree Tom stopped, thrusting right hand in among the\nbushes.  Up and down his hand moved.\n\n\"Shoot and duck!\" snarled Dolph, in a passion because of their\nhaving been discovered.\n\nBoom!\n\nOver by the ridge where Gage and his fellow rascals lay it looked\nas though a volcano had started in operation on a small scale.\n\nFragments of rock, clouds of dirt, splinters and bits of brush\nshot up in the air.\n\nFollowing the report came a volley of terrific yells from Dolph\nand his fellows.\n\nThey had been on the instant of firing when the big explosion\ncame.  Jim Ferrers, too, was taking careful aim at the moment.\n\nIt is a law of Nature that whatever goes up debris, mixed with\nlarger pieces of rock and clots of earth, descended on the scene\nof the explosion.  Yet little of this flying stuff reached Dolph\nGage and his companions, for they were up and running despite\nthe mark that they thus presented to Ferrers.\n\nNor did the rascals stop running until they had reached distant cover.\n\n\"Stop it, Jim---don't shoot!\" gasped Tom Reade, choking with laughter,\nas Ferrers leaped to his feet, taking aim after the fugitives.\n\n\"I want Dolph Gage, while I've got a good, legal excuse,\" growled\nFerrers, glancing along rifle barrel at the forward sight.\n\n\"Don't think of shooting,\" panted Tom, darting forward and laying\na hand on the rifle barrel to spoil the guide's aim.  \"Jim, it\nisn't sportsmanlike to shoot a fleeing enemy in the back!  Fight\nfair and square, Jim---if you must fight.\"\n\nThere was much in this to appeal to the guide's sense of honor and\nfair play.  Though scowled, he lowered the rifle.\n\n\"Tom, you everlasting joker, what happened?\" demanded Harry Hazelton.\n\n\"You saw for yourself, didn't you?\" retorted Reade.\n\n\"Yes; but-----\"\n\n\"Are you so little of an engineer that you don't know a _mine_\nwhen you see one, Harry?\"\n\n\"But how did that mine come to be there?\"\n\n\"I planted it.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"Today, when you started on your ride.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"You see, Harry, I was pondering away over mining problems this\nmorning.  As you had the only horse, that was all that there was\nleft for me to do.  Now, you must have noticed that most of the\noutcropping rock around here is of a very refractory kind?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" nodded Hazelton.\n\n\"Then, of course, you realize that for at least a hundred feet down\nin the mine the rock that would be found would be the same.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly.\"\n\n\"So, Harry, I was figuring on a way to blast ore rock out whenever\nwe should find refractory stuff down a shaft or in the galleries\nor tunnels of a mine.\"\n\n\"Fine, isn't it?\" retorted Hazelton.  \"A great scheme!  You blast\nout the rock and the force of the explosion shoots all the fine\nparticle of gold into the walls of the mine---just the way you'd\npepper a tree with birdshot!\"\n\nMr. Dunlop had drawn close and now stood smiling broadly.\n\n\"That appears to be one on you, Reade,\" suggested the mine promoter.\n\n\"That's what I want to find out,\" returned Tom soberly; \"whether\nI'm a discoverer, or just a plain fool.\"\n\n\"What do you think about it?\"\n\n\"Let's go and look at the ledge, and then I can tell you, sir,\"\nReade answered, striding forward.\n\n\"Look out!\" cautioned Joe Timmins.  \"Those hyenas will shoot.\nThey'll be sore over the trick you played on them, and they'll\nbe hiding waiting for a chance for a shot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother the hyenas,\" Tom retorted, impatiently.  \"I'm out\nfor business today.  Coming, Mr. Dunlop?\"  The mine operator showed\nsigns of hanging back.\n\nHarry promptly joined his chum at what was left of the little ledge.\nAfter a few moments Mr. Dunlop, seeing that no shots were fired,\nstepped over there also, followed by his nephew.  Jim Ferrers climbed\na tree, holding his rifle and keeping his eyes open for a shot,\nwhile Timmins threw himself behind a rock, watching in the direction\nthat the four men had taken.\n\n\"This looks even better than I had expected,\" Tom explained, his\neyes glowing as he held up fragments of rock.  \"You see, the dynamite\ncharge was a low-power one.  It just splintered the rock.  There\nwasn't so very much driving force to the explosion.  Another time\nI could make the force even lower.\"\n\n\"Here's gold in this bit of rock!\" cried Harry, turning, his eyes\nsparkling.\n\n\"Yes; but not enough to look promising,\" replied Mr. Dunlop, after\nexamining the specimen.  \"But we'll look through the rest of the\nstuff that's loose.\"\n\nThe two men who had hung back soon joined them.\n\n\"I wouldn't care about filing a claim to it,\" Mr. Dunlop, shaking\nhis head after some further exploration.  \"This rock wouldn't\nyield enough to the ton to make the work profitable.\"\n\n\"Just a little, outcropping streak, possibly from the claim that\nI have below,\" was Mr. Dunlop's conclusion \"By the way, Reade,\nhow did you explode the mine?\"\n\n\"With a magneto,\" Tom explained, then ran and took the battery\nfrom behind the tree from which he had fired it.  \"I buried the\nwire, of course, so that no one would trip over it,\" he added.\n\"Just after I got it attended to Alf Drew happened along, looked\nforlorn, and wanted a job.  So I had almost forgotten the mine,\nuntil I realized that the thing was planted right in front of\nwhere Dolph Gage's crew were hidden.  By the way, Jim, where is\nAlf?\"\n\n\"All the information I've got wouldn't send you two feet in the right\ndirection,\" the guide reported gruffly.\n\n\"And where are our tents and the other stuff?\" Harry demanded.\n\"Gage's crew couldn't get far with them in the time they've had.\nShall we hustle after our property?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" nodded Tom.\n\n\"At the momentary risk of being shot to pieces,\" added Mr. Dunlop,\ndryly.\n\n\"Those little chances go with being involved in a Nevada mining\ndispute, don't they?\" queried Reade.\n\n\"Where can we begin to look?\" Harry pressed.  \"Let's scurry about\na bit.  Surely men can't get away with tents without leaving some\ntrail.\"\n\nWithin two minutes they had the trail.  Marks were discovered\nthat plainly had been made by dragging canvas and guy-ropes along\nover the ground.\n\n\"We'll find our stuff soon,\" predicted Tom, striding along over\na rough trail.  \"The scoundrels didn't have a team, and they wouldn't\ntake the stuff far without other transportation than their own backs.\nHello!  What's in there?\"\n\nTom had detected some motions in a clump of brush.\n\n\"Look out!\" warned Jim Ferrers, bringing his rifle to \"ready.\"\n\nBut Tom darted straight into the brush.\n\n\"Then this is where you are?\" demanded Tom dryly.  He glanced down\nat the cowering form of Alf Drew.\n\n\"So you've got the 'makings,' have you?\"  Reade demanded, seizing\nAlf by the collar and yanking him up to his feet.\n\nPaper and tobacco fell from young Drew's nerveless grasp to the\nground.\n\n\"You made me drop the makings of a good one,\" whined Alf resentfully.\n\n\"You didn't have that stuff two hours ago.  Where did you get\nit?\" Reade demanded.\n\n\"Found it,\" half whimpered Drew.\n\n\"Do you expect me to believe any such fairy tales as that?\" insisted\nTom Reade.\n\n\"If you have tobacco and cigarette papers,\" Tom continued, \"then\nsome one gave the stuff to you.  It was Dolph Gage, or one of\nhis rascals, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Don't know him,\" replied the boy, with a shake of his head.\n\n\"Now, don't try to fool me, Drew,\" warned Tom, with a mild shake\nadministered to the youngster's shoulders.  \"How much tobacco\nhave you?\"\n\n\"A whole package,\" admitted Alf reluctantly, feeling that it would\nbe of no use to try to deceive his employer.\n\n\"And plenty of papers to go with it?\"\n\n\"Ye-es.\"\n\n\"You got it from four men?\"\n\n\"No; I didn't.\"\n\n\"Well, from one of four men, then?  Tell me the truth.\"\n\n\"Ye-es.\"\n\n\"What did you do to please the four men?\"\n\nAlf Drew shifted uneasily from one foot to the other, and then back\nagain.\n\n\"Come!  Speak up!\" Reade insisted sternly.\n\n\"You're wasting our time.  What did you do for the four men?\"\n\n\"I didn't do anything,\" Alf evaded.\n\n\"What did you tell them, then?\" Reade wanted to know.\n\n\"They asked me a few questions.\"\n\n\"Of course; and you answered the questions.\"\n\n\"Well, I-----\"\n\n\"What did the men want to know about?\" pressed Tom, the look in his\neyes growing sterner still.\n\n\"They wanted to know how many men Jim Ferrers had,\" admitted the\nDrew boy.\n\n\"Oh, I see,\" pondered Tom aloud, a half smile creeping into his\nface.  \"They were guessing the size of Ferrers's army, were they?\"\n\n\"I---I guess so,\" Alf replied.\n\n\"And you told them-----?\"\n\n\"I told 'em the camp was made up of you and Mr. Hazelton, Jim\nFerrers and myself.\"\n\n\"And then they gave you the tobacco for cigarettes, did they?\"\n\n\"I made 'em gimme that first,\" Alf retorted, a look of cunning\nin his eyes.\n\n\"So, my bright little hero, you sold us out for a toy bale of\ncigarettes, did you?\" demanded Tom Reade, staring coldly down\nat the shame-faced youngster.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nNO NEED TO WORK FOR PENNIES\n\n\n\"I---I didn't see how it could do any harm,\" sniveled young Drew.\n\n\"Perhaps it didn't,\" Tom admitted.  \"So far, it has resulted only\nin our being ambushed and all but murdered.  Now, where did they\ntake our tents and the other stuff?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" declared Alf.  \"Are the tents gone?\"  He answered\nso promptly that Reade believed him.\n\n\"Very much so,\" replied Reade, releasing his grip on Drew's shoulder.\n\"Come on, friends, we'll hunt further.\"\n\n\"Say, what was that big explosion?\" asked Alf, running after the\nparty when he found himself being left alone.\n\n\"No time to talk until we find our camp stuff,\" Tom called back\nover his shoulder.\n\n\"I'll help you,\" proposed Alf eagerly.\n\n\"You're full of helpfulness,\" Reade jibed.\n\nBut Alf evidently preferred to stick to them.  He ran along at\nthe heels of the last rapidly striding man.  Joe Timmins was the\nonly one absent, he having remained at the camp site to keep a\nwatchful eye over the automobile.\n\nJim Ferrers was in the lead, his trained eyes searching the ground\nfor the trail of the tents.\n\nWithin five minutes the party came upon the tents and the food\nsupplies, all of which had been dumped into a thicket in confused\npiles.\n\n\"We'll sort this out and get it back to camp,\" Tom proposed.\n\"Alf, little hero, redeem yourself by buckling down to a good\nload.  Come here; let me load you down.\"\n\nAlf meekly submitted, cherishing a half hope that he would not\nbe discharged from his new position after all.\n\nAt the end of an hour the stuff had all been taken back and the\ncamp looked a good deal as it had looked that morning.\n\n\"Now, Alf,\" directed Tom in a milder, kinder tone, \"you hustle\nover and break your back helping Mr. Ferrers to get supper ready.\nWe're a famished lot.  Understand?\"\n\nAlf was only too glad to be able to understand that his part in\nthe dismantling of the camp had been overlooked.  While Tom and\nHarry led their guests into one of the tents, young Drew hastened\nover to where Jim Ferrers was starting a fire in the camp stove.\n\n\"Now, put that stuff back in your pockets, or I'll throw it in\nthe fire!\" sounded the angry voice of Ferrers.  \"You can't use\nany of that stuff when you're working around me.\"\n\n\"The poor little cigarette pest must have been trying to use his\nnewly acquired 'makings,'\" grinned Tom.\n\nWhile Ferrers was thus busied with preparation of the meal, Joe\nTimmins had taken the guide's rifle and was keeping a watchful\neye over the approaches to the neighborhood.\n\n\"So you young men think you could serve me satisfactorily as engineers,\"\nquestioned Mr. Dunlop.\n\n\"I think we could,\" Tom answered.\n\n\"But I am afraid you young men have a rather large notion as to the\npay you're worth,\" continued the mine promoter.\n\n\"That's right, sir,\" Reade nodded.  \"We have a good-sized idea\non the pay question.  Now, when you go to Dugout City next you\nmight wire the president of the S.B. & L. railroad, at Denver,\nor the president of the A.G. & N.M., at Tucson, Arizona, and\nask those gentlemen whether we are in the habit of making good on\nlarge pay.\"\n\n\"How much will you young men want?\"\n\n\"For work of this character,\" replied Tom, after a few moments\nof thought, during which Harry Hazelton was silent, \"we shall\nwant six hundred dollars a month, each, with two hundred dollars\napiece added for the fighting risk.\"\n\n\"The fighting risk?\" questioned Mr. Dunlop.\n\n\"Well, we shall have Dolph Gage and his crowd to guard against, won't\nwe?\" Reads counter-questioned.\n\n\"But such pay is absurd!\" he protested.\n\n\"From your view-point, very likely, sir.  From our view-point\nit will be very ordinary compensation, and nothing but our desire\nto learn more about mining will tempt us to go into it at the figure\nwe have named.\"\n\n\"Your price puts your services out of the question for my company,\"\nreplied Mr. Dunlop, with a shake of his head.\n\n\"Very good, sir,\" Tom rejoined pleasantly.  \"No harm done, and\nwe need not talk it over any more.  We wish you good luck in finding\nproper engineers for your work.  You will probably motor back to\nDugout tomorrow morning, won't you?\"\n\n\"We'll have to,\" Mr. Dunlop answered.  \"We're not safe here until\nwe hire a few good men to come out here to keep Gage and his fellows\nat a distance.\"\n\n\"That's true, sir,\" Tom nodded.  \"As you'll need a good many men\nhere by the time you start work on your mine you'll do well to\nbring at least a score of them down at once.  Twenty good, rough\nmen, used to this life and not afraid of bullets, ought to make\nyou feel wholly safe and secure on your own property.\"\n\nThere was more talk, but neither Tom nor Harry again referred\nto their serving the new company as engineers.\n\nIn due course of time Jim Ferrers, with such help as Alf was able\nto give, had supper ready to serve.  It was a rough meal, of hard\ntack, pilot bread, potatoes, canned meats and vegetables, but\noutdoor life had given all a good appetite and the meal did not\nlong remain on the camp table.\n\nFor guard duty that night it was arranged that Jim Ferrers and\nJoe Timmins should relieve each other.  Tom also offered to stay\nup with Ferrers, Harry taking the watch trick with Timmins, though\nneither of the young engineers was armed or cared to be.\n\nHarry and Timmins were to take the first watch.  The others retired\nearly.  Tom Reade was about to begin undressing when Hazelton came\nin for a moment.\n\nWhile the chums were chatting, Alf Drew's forlorn figure showed\nat the doorway of the tent.\n\n\"Say, boss,\" complained Alf, \"I haven't any place to sleep.\"\n\n\"What?\" Reade demanded in pretended surprise, \"with nearly all\nthe ground in Nevada at your disposal?\"\n\n\"But that isn't a bed,\" contended Alf.\n\n\"Right you are there, lad\" agreed Tom.\n\n\"Now, see here, boss, only one of you two is going to sleep at a\ntime tonight.  I'm tired---I ache.  Why can't I sleep on the other\ncot in this tent?\"\n\n\"Come here,\" ordered Tom.\n\nAlf wonderingly advanced.\n\nWhiff! whiff! moved the young engineer's nostrils.\n\n\"Just as I thought,\" sighed Reade.  \"You've been smoking cigarettes\nwithout any let-up ever since supper.\"\n\n\"Well, I have ter,\" argued Drew.\n\n\"And now you smell as fragrant as a gas-house, Alf.  Mr. Hazelton\nis rather particular about the little matter of cleanliness.\nIf you were to sleep on his cot the smell of cigarettes would\nbe so strong that I don't believe Mr. Hazelton could stay on his\ncot when it came his time to turn in.\"\n\n\"But say!  If you knew how dead, dog-tired I am!\" moaned Alf.\n\n\"Oh, let him sleep on my cot,\" interposed Harry, good-heartedly.\n\"If I can't stand the cot when I come to use it, then it won't\nbe the first night that I've slept on hard ground and rested well.\"\n\n\"All right, Alf, climb in,\" nodded Tom.  \"But see here.  Cigarettes\nmake you as nervous as a lunatic.  If you have any bad dreams\ntonight, and begin yelling, then I'll rise and throw you outdoors.\nDo you understand?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" mumbled the boy.  \"But I won't dream.  I'm not nervous\nnow.  It's only when I can't get enough cigs that I'm nervous.\"\n\n\"You should have seen him this afternoon,\" Tom continued, turning\nto his chum.  \"The lad and I took a walk.  At every other step\nhe kept imagining that he heard rattlesnakes rattling.\"\n\n\"And I did, too,\" contended Alf stoutly.  \"You know I did.  You\nheard 'em yourself, Mr. Reade.\"\n\n\"I didn't hear a single rattler,\" Tom replied soberly.\n\n\"Let the tired little fellow go to bed in peace,\" urged Harry.\n\n\"All right,\" Tom agreed.\n\nAlf went to the head of the cot, to turn the blanket down from\nthe head.\n\nClick-ick-ick-ick!  came the warning sound.\n\nWith a yell of terror Alf Drew bounded back.\n\n\"There's another rattler,\" he screamed.  \"It's under that blanket.\"\n\n\"It's all your nerves,\" Tom retorted.  \"There isn't a rattler\nwithin miles of here.\"\n\n\"Didn't you hear a rattle, Mr. Reade?\" wailed the cigarette fiend.\n\n\"No; I didn't.\"\n\n\"Didn't you, Mr. Hazelton?\"\n\nHarry was on the point of answering \"yes,\" but Tom caught his\neyes, and Harry, knowing that something was up, shook his head.\n\n\"You must both be deaf, then,\" argued Drew.\n\n\"Why, see here, you nervous little wreck of a cigarette,\" said Tom,\ngrinning good-humoredly, \"I'll show you that there is no snake in\nthat bed.  Watch me.\"\n\nWith utmost unconcern, Tom took hold of the blanket, stripping\nit from the cot.  Then he ran his hands over the under blanket.\n\n\"Not a thing in this bed but what belongs here,\" Tom explained.\n\"Alf, do you see how cigarettes are taking the hinges off your\nnerves.\"\n\nShame-faced, and believing that Tom was right, Alf advanced toward\nthe cot.  As he reached the side of it-----\n\nClick-ick-ick! sounded close to him.\n\n\"You can't make me stay in this tent.  It's the most dangerous\nspot in Nevada,\" cried Drew, turning and fleeing into flee open.\nThe two chums could hear his feet as he sped to another part\nof the camp.\n\n\"Some trick about that rattling?\" queried Harry in a whisper.\n\n\"Of course,\" Tom admitted with a wink.\n\n\"It's a shame to tease the youngster so.\"\n\n\"It would be,\" Tom assented rather gravely, \"but I'm using that\nmeans to make the lad afraid to smoke cigarettes.  If young Drew\ngoes on smoking the miserable little things he'll become come a\nphysical wreck inside of a year.\"\n\n\"How do you do the trick, anyway?\" asked Harry curiously.\n\n\"Does it really sound like the click of a rattler?\" asked Tom.\n\n\"Does it?  I was 'stung' almost as badly as poor Alf was.  How\ndo you do the trick?\"\n\n\"I'll show you, some time,\" nodded Tom Reade.\n\nWith that promise Harry had to be content, and so must the reader,\nfor the present.\n\nHazelton went out to stand first watch with Joe Timmins.  Alf\nDrew, finding that the Dunlop party had no room for him under\nthe shelter they had rigged from the rear of the automobile, curled\nhimself on the ground under a tree and fitfully wooed sleep.\nBy daylight the little fellow was fretfully awake, his \"nerves\"\nrefusing him further rest until he had rolled and smoked two cigarettes.\nBy the time the smoke was over Jim Ferrers called to him to help\nstart the breakfast.\n\nNothing had been seen of the four intruders through the night.\n\n\"I think we shall try to get safely through to Dugout City this\nmorning,\" suggested Mr. Dunlop.\n\n\"You'll make it all right, if you have gasoline enough,\" remarked\nFerrers, who hovered close at hand with a frying pan filled with\ncrisp bacon.\n\n\"You don't believe Gage will try to attack us on the way?\"\n\n\"He has no call to,\" replied Ferrers.  \"You're obeying him by\nleaving the claim, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Then probably Gage and his companions will settle down on the\nclaim after we leave,\" suggested Mr. Dunlop.\n\n\"If Gage tries to jump the claim in your absence,\" proposed Ferrers,\n\"your course is easy.  If you have the legal right to the claim\nyou'll have to bring back force enough to drive those hyenas off.\"\n\n\"Will you people try to keep an eye over the claim while I'm gone?\"\nasked Mr. Dunlop.\n\n\"That would be a little out of our line,\" Tom made reply.  \"Besides,\nMr. Dunlop, I'm not at all sure that we shall be here until you\nreturn.\"\n\n\"But we haven't settled, Reade, whether you and your partner are\nto be our engineers at the Bright Hope Mine.\"\n\n\"Quite true, sir,\" nodded Tom.  \"On the other hand, you haven't\nengaged us, either\"\n\n\"Won't you keep the matter open until our return?\"\n\n\"That would be hardly good business, Mr. Dunlop.\"\n\n\"Yet suppose I had engaged you,\"\n\n\"Then we'd be going back to Dugout City with you.\"\n\n\"Why, Reade?\"\n\n\"So that we might get in touch with the world and find out whether\nyou are financially responsible.  We wouldn't take an engagement\nwithout being reasonably sure of our money.\"\n\n\"You're a sharp one,\" laughed Mr. Dunlop.\n\nYet he made no further reference to engaging the two young engineers,\na fact that Reade was keen enough to note.\n\nWithin an hour after breakfast the Dunlop ear pulled out, leaving\nTom Reade with only his own party.\n\n\"What our friend wants,\" smiled Harry, \"is a pair of mining engineers\nat the salary of one mere surveyor.\"\n\n\"He won't pay any more than he has to,\" rejoined Reade.\n\n\"Do you really want to work for Dunlop?\"\n\n\"I really don't care a straw whether I do or not,\" was Tom's answer.\n\"Harry, we're in the very heart of the gold country and we don't\nneed to work for copper pennies.\"\n\n\"If you'll allow me to say so, friends,\" put in Jim Ferrers, \"I\nbelieve you two are the original pair with long heads and I'm going\nto stick to you as long as you'll let me.\"\n\n\"Me, too,\" piped up Alf Drew ungrammatically.\n\nThe young cigarette fiend was at that instant engaged in rolling\none of his paper abominations.\n\nClick-ick-ick-ick!\n\n\"Rattlers again!\" shivered Alf.\n\nPaper and tobacco fell from his fingers and he fled in terror.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTOM CATCHES THE \"NEVADA FEVER\"\n\n\nTwo nights passed without adventure.  On each of these nights\nthe three campers---for Alf didn't \"count\" divided the hours\nof darkness into three watches, each standing guard in his turn.\nOn the third morning after the departure of the Bright Hope\ngroup the campers were seated at breakfast around the packing\ncase that served as table.\n\n\"I feel as though we ought to be at work,\" suggested Hazelton.\n\n\"Good!\" mocked Tom.  \"You've been riding every day lately, and\nI have remained in camp, testing samples of ore that I've picked\nup on my strolls.\"\n\n\"You take the horse today,\" proposed Harry, \"and I'll stay in\ncamp and work.\"\n\n\"Suppose both of us stay in and work,\" proposed Reade.\n\n\"That'll be all right, too,\" nodded Harry, pleasantly.  \"May I\nask, Tom, what you're up to, anyway?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Reade smiled.  \"If the Bright Hope is a real mine there\nmust be other good property in this region.  I've been looking\nabout, and making an assay every now and then.  Jim, you've prospected\na bit, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" nodded the guide.  \"And, gentlemen, in my day I've been\nsole owner of three claims, each one of which panned out a fortune.\"\n\n\"Great!\" glowed Harry.  \"But how did you lose your money, Jim!\"\n\n\"I never got a cent out of any of the mines,\" rejoined the guide\ngrimly.\n\n\"How did that happen?\"\n\n\"Did you ever hear of 'square gamblers'?\" inquired Ferrers.\n\n\"Some,\" Tom admitted with a grimace.  \"We ran up against one of\nthat brood in Arizona, eh, Harry?\"\n\n\"You didn't play against him, I hope, hinted Jim soberly.\n\n\"Yes, we did,\" admitted Tom.  \"Not with his own marked cards,\nthough, nor with any kind of cards.  We met him with men's weapons,\nand it is necessary to add that our 'square gambler' lost.\"\n\n\"The 'square gamblers' that I met didn't lose,\" sighed Jim Ferrers.\n\"They won, and that's why all three of my mines passed out of my\nhands before they began to pay.\"\n\n\"You must know something about ore and croppings, and the like,\nJim?\", Tom continued.\n\n\"In a prospector's way, yes,\" Ferrers admitted.\n\n\"Then we'll take a walk, now.  Alf can wash up the dishes.\"\n\n\"It's all the little wretch is fit for,\" muttered Ferrers\ncontemptuously.\n\nJim looked carefully into the magazine of his repeating ride, then\nsaw to it that his ammunition belt was filled.\n\n\"Ready when you gentlemen are,\" he announced.\n\n\"Say, won't you take me with you?\" pleaded Alf.\n\n\"You wouldn't be of any use to us,\" Reade answered.\n\n\"But I---I am afraid to stay here alone.\"\n\n\"Do you believe yourself to be so valuable that any one will want\nto steal you?\" Tom laughed.\n\nAlf made a wry face and watched the others depart.  Then, filled\nwith needless alarm, he crawled out into a thicket and hid himself.\nHe didn't mean to be trapped by prowlers!\n\nTom led the way for nearly a mile.  At last the trio climbed a\nslight ascent, halting at the top of the ridge.\n\n\"You see, Jim,\" Tom explained, \"this ridge runs southwesterly\nfrom here.\"\n\n\"I see it does?\" nodded the guide.\n\n\"Now, to the northeastward I don't believe there are any croppings\nthat look good enough.  But just keep along to the southeast,\npicking up a specimen here and there.  Some of the rock looks\ngood to me.\"\n\nJim Ferrers didn't answer in words, though his eyes gleamed with the\nold fever that he had known before.\n\n\"Here's a pretty piece of stone,\" called the guide in a low tone.\nHe stood holding a fragment about as big as his two fists.\n\n\"It's streaked\" pretty well with yellow, you see, gentlemen,\"\nhe remarked;\n\n\"It is,\" Tom agreed, taking the specimen.\n\n\"Does the vein run with the top of the ridge?\" demanded Harry\neagerly.\n\n\"It runs a little more to eastward, from this point, I think,\"\nTom made answer.  \"But let us walk along, in three parallel lines,\nand see who finds the best indications.\"\n\nBy noon all three were fairly tired out by the steep climbing\nover the rocky ground.  Each had as many specimens as he could\ncarry.  The result of the exploration had tended to confirm Tom's\nnotion as to where the vein lay.\n\n\"Now, let's see about where we'd stake the claim,\" Tom proposed.\n\"Of course, we want to get the best rock obtainable.  We don't\nwant to leave the best part of this slope for some one else to\nstake out.  It seems to me that the claim ought to start up by\nthat blasted tree.  What do you say, Jim?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't like to make mistakes where you young gentleman\nare concerned,\" Ferrers answered, taking off his felt hat and\nscratching his head.  \"You see, it isn't my claim.\"\n\n\"The dickens it isn't!\" Reade retorted.\n\n\"Why, you---you gentlemen didn't plan to take me in, did you,\"\nasked Ferrers, opening his eyes very wide in his amazement over\nthe idea.  \"You see I---I can't contribute my share of the brains,\nalong with a pair like you,\" continued the guide.  \"Look at you\ntwo---engineers already!  Then look at me---more'n twice as old\nas either of you, and yet I'm only a cook.\"\n\n\"You're an honest man, aren't you, Jim?\" demanded Reade.\n\n\"Why, there's some folks who say I am,\" Ferrers slowly admitted.\n\n\"And we're among those who believe that way,\" Tom continued.\n\"Now, Jim, you're with us, and you've every right to be a partner\nif we find anything worth taking up in the mine line.\"\n\n\"But there ain't no sense in it,\" protested the guide, his voice\nshaking with emotion.  \"You don't need me.\"\n\n\"We need a man of your kind, Jim,\" Tom rejoined, resting a very\nfriendly hand on the guide's shoulder.  \"Listen to me.  Hazelton\nand I are engineers first of all.  We'd sooner be engineers than\nkings.  Now, the lure of gold is all well enough, and we're human\nenough to like money.  Yet a really big engineering chance would\ntake us away from a gold mine almost any day in the year.  Eh,\nHarry!\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it would,\" confirmed Hazelton.\n\n\"If we left a paying mine, Jim, what would we want?\" Tom continued.\n\"We'd want an honest partner, wouldn't we---one whom we could\nleave for six months or a year and still be able to depend on\ngetting our share of the profits of the mine.  You've gambled\nin the past, Jim, but you stopped that years ago.  Now you're\nhonest and safe.  Do you begin to see, Jim Ferrers, where you\ncome in?  Another point.  How old do you take us to be?\"\n\n\"Well, you're more than twenty-one, each of you,\" replied Ferrers.\n\n\"Not quite, as yet,\" Tom answered.  \"So, you see, in order to\ntake out a claim we'd need a guardian, and one whom we could depend\nupon not to rob us.  Jim, if we're to take up a mine we must have\na third man in with us.  Do you know a man anywhere who'd use\nus more honestly than you would?\"\n\n\"I don't,\" exclaimed Jim Ferrers.  \"At the same time, gentlemen,\nI know your kind well enough.  Both of you talk of fighting as\nthough you dreaded it, but I'll tell you, gentlemen, that I wouldn't\n_dare_ to try any nasty tricks on either of you.\"\n\n\"We understand each other, then,\" Tom nodded.  \"Now, then, let\nus try to make up our minds just where we would want to stake\noff this claim if the gold assays as well as it looks.\"\n\nAt the beginning Tom and Harry built a little pile of stones.\nThen, by mere pacing they laid off what they judged to be the\nfifteen hundred feet of length which the government allows to\na single mining claim.\n\n\"We can attend to the proper width later,\" suggested Tom.  \"Now,\nwhat do you say if we make for camp at once.  I'm not hungry;\nstill, I think I could eat my half of a baked ox.\"\n\nThe instant that the trio reached camp, Jim Ferrers, with an unwonted\nmist in his eyes, began to juggle the cooking utensils.  Tom busied\nhimself with building the best fire that he could under the chamber\nof the assaying furnace, while Harry Hazelton, rolling up his\nsleeves, began to demonstrate his muscle by pulverizing little\npiles of ore in a hand-mill.\n\n\"Be careful not to mix the lots, Harry,\" advised Tom, glancing\nover from his station by the furnace.\n\n\"Thanks for the caution,\" smiled Hazelton.  \"But I have just enough\nintelligence left to understand the value of knowing from what\nsection of the slope each particular lot of rock comes.\"\n\nDinner was eaten in silence.  For one thing the campers were\nravenously hungry.  In the second place, though each kept as quiet\nas possible, he was deep in the thrall of the fever to dig up\nhidden gold.\n\nThe meal was nearly over when Alf Drew came into camp.\n\n\"Are you leaving anything to eat?\" he asked.\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Jim Ferrers grimly, \"but you were left to wash the\nbreakfast dishes, and you haven't done it yet.  Now, you'll wash the\nbreakfast things, and then the dinner things, before you get even a\ncold bite to eat.\"\n\nAlf didn't protest.  Now that he was back safe in camp he felt\nmuch ashamed of himself for having run away and left the camp\nunwatched.\n\nAs soon as he had eaten his dinner Tom Reade went back to the\nassay furnace to improve the fire.\n\n\"Now, Harry, we'll get the powdered stuff ready to roast,\" Reade\nremarked.  \"We've a lot of it to rush through this afternoon.\"\n\n\"And we want to be sure to finish it at least two hours before\ndark, too,\" Larry nodded.  \"If we decide to file a claim Jim ought\nto be riding for Dugout City by dark, ready to file the papers\nthe first thing in the morning.\"\n\n\"And Jim can bring back half a dozen men to help us sink the first\nshaft,\" proposed Tom.\n\n\"That's where I feel like a fool,\" muttered Ferrers.  \"I haven't\na blessed dollar to put in as capital.\"\n\n\"We'll take your honesty for a good deal in the way of capital,\nJim,\" Tom hinted cheerfully.\n\n\"Harry, you might get out the transit, the tape, markers and other\nthings.  If we stake out a claim we'll do it so accurately that there\ncan be no fight, afterward, as to the real boundaries of our claim.\"\n\n\"What shall we call the claim?\" inquired Hazelton, as he came\nback with the surveying outfit.\n\n\"Suppose we wait until the assay is done, and find out whether\nthe claim is worth anything better than a bad name,\" laughed Tom.\n\nThe crucibles were in the furnace now, and a hot flame going.\nJim Ferrers sat by, puffing reflectively at his pipe as he squatted\non the ground nearby.  Alf Drew was smoking, too, somewhere, but\nhe had taken his offensive cigarettes to some place of concealment.\n\nHarry anxiously watched the course of the sun, while Tom kept\nhis gaze, most of the time, near the furnace.\n\n\"Come on, Harry!\" called Tom at last.  \"We'd rake out the crucibles.\nMy, but I hope the buttons are going to be worth weighing.\"\n\nA withering blast of hot air reached the young engineers as the\noven door of the portable assay furnace was thrown open.  The\ncrucibles were raked out and set in the air to cool.\n\n\"Would fanning the crucibles with my hat do any good?\" asked Hazelton\neagerly.\n\n\"Some,\" yawned Tom, \"if you're impatient.\"\n\nReade strolled off under the trees, whistling softly to himself.\nJim Ferrers smoked a little faster, the only sign he gave of\nthe anxiety that was consuming him.  Harry frequently sprang to\nhis feet, walked up and down rapidly, then sat down again.  Two\nor three times Hazelton burned his fingers, testing to see whether\nthe crucibles were cool enough to handle.  At last Tom strolled\nback, his gaze on the dial of his watch.\n\n\"Cool enough for a look, now, I think,\" Reade announced.\n\nHarry bounded eagerly toward the crucibles, feeling them with\nhis hands.\n\n\"Plenty cool enough,\" he reported.  \"But how did you guess, Tom?\"\n\n\"I didn't guess,\" Reade laughed.  \"I've timed the crucibles before\nthis, and I know to a minute how long it ought to take.\"\n\n\"What a chump I am!\" growled Harry, in contempt for self.  \"I\nnever think of such things as that.\"\n\nTom now carefully emptied the crucibles.  In the bottom of each\nwas found a tiny bead of half-lustrous metal, which miners and\nassayers term the \"button.\"\n\n\"The real stuff!\" glowed Hazelton.\n\n\"Ye-es,\" said Tom slowly.  \"But the next question is whether the\nbuttons will weigh enough to hint at good-paying ore.  Even at\nthat, these buttons are only from surface ore.\"\n\n\"But the ore underneath is always better than the surface ore,\"\ncontended Hazelton.\n\n\"Usually is,\" Tom corrected.  \"If we get good enough results from\nthis assay it will at least be worth while to stake a claim and\nwork it for a while.\"\n\nHarry waited with feverish impatience.  Tom Reade, on the other\nhand, was almost provokingly slow and cool as he carefully adjusted\nthe sensitive assaying balance and finally weighed the buttons.\nThen he did some slow, painstaking calculating.  At last he looked up.\n\n\"Well, sir?\" asked Jim Ferrers.\n\n\"From this surface ore,\" replied Tom calmly, \"twenty-eight dollars\nin gold to the ton; silver, six dollars.\"\n\n\"That's good enough for me!\" cried Ferrers, his eyes brightening.\n\n\"Wow! Whoop!  Oh---whee!\" vented Harry, then ran and snatched\nup the surveying transit.\n\n\"Yes; I guess we'd better go along and do our staking,\" assented Tom.\n\n\"And I'll be ready at daylight to file the claim at Dugout City,\"\npromised Jim.  \"I won't sleep until I've seen our papers filed.\"\n\n\"You'll file the claim in your own name, Jim,\" Tom suddenly suggested.\n\n\"No; I won't,\" retorted Ferrers.  \"I'll play squarely.\"\n\n\"That will be doing squarely by us, Jim,\" Tom continued.  \"We\ndon't want to use up our claim privileges on one stretch of Nevada\ndirt.\"\n\nIf we can find claims enough we'll stake out three, and then pool\nthem all together in a gentlemen's agreement.\"\n\n\"That's a good deal of trust you're showing in me, gentlemen,\" said\nJim huskily.\n\n\"Never mind, Jim,\" returned Reade quietly.  \"You can show us, you\nknow, that we didn't waste our confidence.\"\n\nWhile they were still talking the three came in sight of the ridge.\n\n\"Look there!\" gasped Harry suddenly.\n\n\"Dolph Gage and his tin-horn crowd!\" flared Jim Ferrers, in anger.\n\"Hang the fellow!  This time I'll-----\"\n\n\"Stop fingering your rifle, Jim,\" ordered Reade.  \"Remember, nothing\nlike fighting!  If they haven't filed notice in due form on the claim,\nwe're safe yet.  If they have-----\"\n\n\"Look!\" hissed Ferrers.\n\nAt that moment Dolph Gage could be seen nailing a sheet of white\npaper to a board driven into the soil.\n\n\"We've staked what you want, I reckon!\" bellowed Gage laconically.\n\"Staked it in due form, too, if you want to know.\"\n\n\"I guess we've lost that claim,\" said Tom slowly.\n\n\"Have we?\" hissed Jim Ferrers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nREADY TO HANDLE THE PICK\n\n\n\"Keep off this ground!\" yelled Dolph Gage, snatching up his rifle.\n\n\"Stop that nonsense,\" Tom bellowed back in his own lusty voice.\n\n\"You've no right on this ground.\"\n\n\"Yes, we have, if you want to know,\" Tom continued.  \"You haven't\nfiled your papers at Dugout yet.\"\n\n\"How do you know we haven't?\"\n\n\"I'll take a chance on it,\" smiled Tom amiably, as he and his\ncompanions continued to walk nearer.\n\nJim Ferrers held his rifle so that it would take him but an instant\nto swing it into action if the need came.\n\n\"If you've filed your papers for this claim\" Tom continued, lowering\nhis voice somewhat as they drew nearer to the four rascals.  \"Have\nyou any such paper to show us?\"\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" growled Dolph Gage, his evil eyes seeming to shoot\nflame.  \"But we've got our notice of claim nailed up here.  We\ngot it here first, and now you can't file any mining entry at\nDugout City for this bit o' ground.\"\n\n\"Not if your notice is written in the prescribed language,\" Tom\nadmitted.\n\n\"Well, it is.  Now, keep off this ground, or we'll shoot you so\nfull of holes that you'll all three pass for tolerable lead mines!\"\n\n\"If you don't shoot and make a good job of it,\" Reade insisted,\n\"I'm going to look over your notice of claim and see whether it's\nworded in a way that will hold in law.\"\n\n\"Drop 'em, boys!  Don't let 'em near!\" roared Dolph Gage, swinging\nhis rifle as though to bring it to his shoulder.\n\nBut Jim Ferrers had forestalled him.  The guide was gazing at his\nenemy through his rifle sights.\n\n\"Drop your weapon, Dolph Gage, and do it blazing quick, or I'll\nshoot you where you stand!\" sounded Jim's voice, low and businesslike.\n\"If any of you other galoots tries to raise his weapon I'll turn\nand drop him.\"\n\nAs Jim Ferrers had a reputation in Nevada as a rifle shot the\nothers hesitated, then let their rifles drop to the ground.\n\n\"Hold them to their present good intentions, Jim,\" said Tom, with\na smile, as he continued to move forward.  \"Now, Mr. Gage---I\nbelieve that's your name let me see what kind of notice you know\nhow to draw up.\"\n\n\"There 'tis,\" muttered Dolph sullenly, pointing to the board.\n\nTom read the notice through under his breath, word by word.\n\n\"You've done this sort of thing before, I guess, Gage,\" said Reade\nquietly.\n\n\"You bet I have.  Find it all reg'lar, too, don't you?\"\n\n\"As nearly as I can tell, it is,\" agreed Tom.\n\n\"And the claim is ours.\"\n\n\"It's yours if you file the formal papers soon enough.\"\n\n\"They'll be filed first thing tomorrow morning,\" grunted Dolph\nGage.  \"Now, try a two-step off the dirt that goes with this claim.\"\n\n\"Not until I've seen the borders that you claim,\" Tom rejoined.\n\n\"Why!\" demanded Gage cunningly.  \"Going to start your claim right\nat the corners of ours.\"\n\n\"If you'll pardon me,\" Reade smiled, \"I don't believe I'll tell\nyou anything about my intentions.\"\n\n\"Maybe you think this claim is a pretty valuable one,\" Gage insinuated.\n\n\"I didn't say so.\"\n\n\"But you would have staked if we hadn't done it first.\"\n\n\"That's what you've got to guess,\" smiled Reade.\n\n\"Say, now you've lost this claim, tell us some thing straight,\nwon't youth begged Dolph.\n\n\"Tell you something straight?\" repeated Tom.  \"Certainly.  I'll tell\nyou something just as straight as I know how,\"\n\n\"Well,\" he said, at last, \"you said you'd tell us something straight.\"\n\n\"And so I will,\" laughed Tom.  \"It's just this: Go to blazes!\"\n\n\"Come, now, don't get fresh, kid!\" warned Dolph angrily.  \"If\nwe're going to be on neighboring claims you may find it a heap\nto your advantage to use us about half-way decent and polite.\"\n\nTom didn't answer at once.  He was rapidly covering the statement\nof location from the paper nailed to the board.\n\n\"You fellows picked up a lot of ore stuff around here,\" continued\nDolph Gage.\n\n\"Yes?\" Tom inquired.  \"Did you see us?\"\n\n\"Yes, and we also saw you making an assay.\"\n\n\"You did.\"\n\n\"Of course we did.  Say, friend, how did that assay come out?\"\n\n\"It came out of the furnace,\" Tom answered still writing.\n\n\"'Course it did.  But say, how did that assay read?\"\n\n\"Read?\" repeated Tom.  \"Why, bless me, I never knew that an assay\ncould read.\"\n\n\"You know what I meant, younker.  How did it figger?\"\n\n\"To the best of my belief,\" said Tom, \"an assay is as much unable\nto figure as it is to read.\"\n\n\"Don't waste any more time on the kid, Dolph,\" growled another\nof the group.  \"He won't tell you anything that you want to know.\"\n\n\"If he doesn't\" rejoined Gage, \"maybe he'll miss something.  See\nhere---Reade's your name, isn't it?\"\n\n\"You've got that much of your information straight,\" assented\nTom, looking up with a smile.\n\n\"Well, Reade, maybe you'd better be a bit more polite and sociable.\nYou've missed staking this claim, but I think we can fix it to give\nyou a job here as engineer.\"\n\n\"That would be very kind of you, I'm sure,\" nodded Tom.  \"But I\ncan't undertake any work for you.\"\n\n\"Then you'll lose some money.\"\n\n\"I'm used to losing money,\" smiled Tom.  \"As for my partner, he's a\nreal wonder in the way of losing money.  He lost ten cents yesterday.\"\n\n\"We've got a fine claim,\" asserted Dolph Gage.  It's right under\nour feet, and there isn't another such claim in Nevada.  Now,\nif you two want to make any real money you'd better begin to be\ndecent with us right now.  Otherwise, you won't get the job.\nNow, what do you say?\"\n\n\"I vote for 'otherwise,'\" laughed Reade, turning on his heel.\n\n\"Oh, you run along and be independent, then,\" called Dolph Gage\nafter him.  \"If you're going to stick the winter through on this\nRange you'll be hungry once or twice between now and spring, if\nyou don't take the trouble to get in right with us.\"\n\n\"Why?\" questioned Reade, halting and looking squarely back.  \"Do\nyou steal food, too?\"\n\nOnce More Tom turned on his heel.  Harry walked along with him.\nJim Ferrers all but walked backward, holding his rifle ready\nand keeping a keen eye over the claim stealers.\n\n\"Come along, Jim,\" called Tom at last.  \"Those fellows won't do\nany shooting.  Their minds are now set on their new claim.  They\nexpect to dig out gold enough to enable them to buy two or three\nbanks.  They won't shoot unless they're driven to it.\"\n\nJim Ferrers turned and walked with the boys.\n\nFifteen seconds later a rifle cracked out behind them, the bullet\nstriking the dirt well to the left of Tom's party.\n\n\"It's a bluff, Jim, and-----\" began Reade.\n\nCrack! spoke Ferrers's ride.\n\n\"I knocked Gage's hat off,\" said the guide dryly.  \"Now, if he\nfires again, it'll show that he's looking for trouble.\"\n\n\"The fellow who goes looking for trouble is always a fool,\" Tom\nremarked.\n\n\"Because trouble is the most worthless thing in the world, yet\na fellow who goes looking for it is always sure to find twice\nas much as he thought he wanted.\"\n\nBy the time the young engineers had reached their own camp, Harry,\nwhose face had been growing gradually \"longer\" on the walk, sank\nto the ground in an attitude of dejection.\n\n\"Just our luck!\" he growled.  \"Gage is right when he says that\nclaim is the best in this part of Nevada.  And, just because we\nwere too slow, we lost it.  Fortune, you know, Tom, knocks but\nonce at any man's door.\"\n\n\"I don't believe that,\" said Tom stoutly.  \"Harry, now that we've\nmade a start and lost, my mind is made up as to our course now.\nI hope you'll agree with me.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Hazelton asked.\n\n\"Harry, old fellow, we'll turn mining engineers in earnest for\nthe present.  We'll engineer our own mines, with Jim for a partner.\nHarry, we'll get up our muscle with pickaxes.  We'll stake our\nfortunes on the turn of a pick!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nJIM FERRERS, PARTNER\n\n\n\"You mean it, do you?\" asked Hazelton, after a pause of a few moments.\n\n\"I never meant anything more in my life!\"\n\n\"Then, of course, I'll agree to it, Tom.  If I go astray, it'll be\nthe first time that I ever went wrong through following your advice.\"\n\n\"And you're with us, Ferrers?\" inquired Tom, looking around.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" spoke the guide feelingly, \"after the way you've\nused me, and the way you've talked to me, I'm with you in anything,\nand I can wait a month, any time, to find out what that 'anything'\nmeans.  Just give me your orders.\"\n\n\"Orders are not given to partners,\" Tom told him.\n\n\"Orders go with _this_ partner,\" Jim asserted gravely.  \"And,\ngentlemen, if we make any money, just hand me what you call my\nshare and I'll never ask any questions.\"\n\n\"Jim, we're going in for mining,\" Tom continued.  \"I can speak\nfor Mr. Hazelton now, for he has authorized me to do so.  Mining\nit is, Jim, but we three are young and tender, and not expert\nwith pickaxes.  We'd better have some experts.  Can you pick up\nat least six real miners at Dugout City?\"\n\n\"A feller usually can,\" Ferrers replied.\n\n\"Then if you'll put in a good part of tonight riding, tomorrow\nyou can do your best to pick up the men.  Get the kind, Jim, who\ndon't balk at bullets when they have to face 'em, for we've a\nhornets' nest over yonder.  Get sober, level-headed fellows who\nknow how to fight---men of good judgment and nerve.  Pay 'em what's\nright.  You know the state of wages around here.  While you're\nat Dugout, Jim, pick out a two-mule team and a good, dependable\nwagon for carting supplies.  Put all the chuck aboard that you\nthink we'll need for the next two or three weeks.  I'll give you,\nalso, a list of digging tools and some of the explosives that\nwe'll need in shaft sinking.  While you're in Dugout, Jim, pick\nup two good ponies, with saddles and bridles.  I guess I'd better\nwrite down some of these instructions, hadn't I?\"\n\n\"And write down the street corner where I'm to pick up the money,\nMr. Reade,\" begged Ferrers dryly.  \"You can't do much in the credit\nline in Nevada.\"\n\n\"The street corner where you're to find the money, eh, Jim?\" smiled\nTom.  \"Yes; I believe I can do that, too.  You know the map of\nDugout, don't you?\"\n\n\"'Course.\"\n\n\"You know where to find the corner of Palace Avenue and Mission\nStreet?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"On one of those four corners,\" Tom continued, \"you'll find the\nDugout City Bank.\"\n\n\"I've seen the place,\" nodded Ferrers, \"but I never had any money\nin it.\"\n\n\"You will have, one of these days,\" smiled Tom, taking out a fountain\npen and shaking it.  Next he drew a small, oblong book from an\ninside pocket, and commenced writing on one of the pages.  This\npage he tore out and handed Ferrers.\n\n\"What's this?\" queried the guide.\n\n\"That's an order on the Dugout City Bank to hand you one thousand\ndollars.\"\n\nFerrers stared at the piece of paper incredulously.\n\n\"What'll the feller pay me in?\" he demanded.  \"Lead at twelve cents\na pound?  And say, will he hand me the lead out of an automatic gun?\"\n\n\"If the paying teller serves you that way,\" rejoined Reade, \"you'll\nhave a right to feel peevish about it.  But he won't.  Hazelton\nand I have the money in bank to stand behind that check.\"\n\n\"You have?\" inquired Ferrers, opening his eyes wide.  \"Fellers\nat your age have that much money in banks\"\n\n\"And more, too,\" Tom nodded.  \"Did you think, Jim, that we had\nnever earned any money?\"\n\n\"Well, I didn't know that you probably made more'n eighteen or\ntwenty dollars a week,\" Ferrers declared.\n\n\"We've made slightly more than that, with two good railroad jobs\nbehind us,\" Tom laughed.  \"And here's our firm pass-book at the\nbank, Jim.  You'll see by it that we have a good deal more than\na thousand dollars there.  Now, you draw the thousand that the\ncheck calls for.  When you're through you may have some money\nleft.  If you do, turn the money in at the bank, have it entered\non the pass-book and then bring the book to me.\"\n\n\"I'll have to think this over,\" muttered Ferrers, \"and you'd better\nset down most of it in writing so that I won't forget.\"\n\nThe smoke from the cook fire brought Alf Drew in from hiding, his\nfinger-tips stained brown as usual.\n\n\"Now, see here, young man,\" said Tom gravely, \"there is no objection\nto your taking some of your time off with your 'makings,' but\nFerrers is going away, and you must stay around more for the next\ntwo or three days.  Otherwise, there won't be any meals or any\npayday coming to you.\"\n\n\"Is Mr. Ferrers going to Dugout City?\" asked Alf, with sudden\ninterest.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Say, I'll work mighty hard if you'll advance me fifty cents and\nlet me get an errand done by Mr. Ferrers.\"\n\n\"Here's the money,\" smiled Tom, passing over the half dollar.\n\nAlf was in such haste that he forgot to express his thanks.  Racing\nover to Jim the little fellow said something in a very low voice.\n\n\"No; I won't!\" roared Ferrers.  \"Nothing of the sort!\"\n\n\"Does he want you to get the 'makings,' Jim!\" called Tom.\n\n\"Yes; but I won't do it,\" the guide retorted.\n\n\"Please do,\" asked Tom.\n\n\"What?  _You_ ask me to do it, sir?  Then all right.  I will.\"\n\n\"What do you want to do that for?\" murmured Harry.\n\n\"Let the poor little runt have his 'makings,' if he wants,\" Tom\nproposed.  \"But I don't believe that Alf will smoke the little white\npests very much longer.\"\n\n\"You're going to stop him?\"\n\n\"I'm going to make him want to stop it himself,\" Tom rejoined,\nwith a slight grin.\n\nAlf came back, looking much pleased.\n\n\"Let me feel your pulse,\" requested Reade.  \"Now, let me see your\ntongue.\"\n\nThis much accomplished, Tom next turned down the under lid of\none of young Drew's eyes and gazed at the lack of red there displayed.\n\n\"I see,\" remarked Reade gravely, \"that your nerves are going all\nto pieces.\"\n\n\"I feel fine,\" asserted Alf stolidly.\n\n\"You must, with your nerves in the state I now find them,\" retorted\nthe young engineer.  \"Next thing I know you'll be hearing things.\"\n\nClick-ick-ick!\n\n\"Wow-ow-wow!\" shrieked Alf Drew, bounding some ten feet away from the\nlow bush near which he had been standing.\n\nClick-ick-ick-ick!\n\n\"Get away from that bush, Mr. Reade!\" howled the young cigarette\nfiend.  \"That rattler will bite you, if you don't.\"\n\n\"I didn't hear any rattler,\" said Tom gravely.  \"Did you, Harry?\"\n\n\"Not a rattle,\" said Hazelton soberly.\n\nJim Ferrers looked on and grinned behind Alf's back.  The youngster\nwas trembling.  As Tom came near him the \"rattle\" sounded again.\nWithin five minutes two more warning \"rattles\" had been heard near\nthe boy.\n\n\"The camp must be full of 'em,\" wailed the terrified boy.  \"And\nI'm afraid of rattlers.\"\n\n\"So am I, Alf,\" Tom assured him, \"but I haven't heard one of the\nreptiles.  The trouble is with your nerves, Drew.  And your nerves\nare in league with your brain.  If you go on smoking cigarettes\nyou won't have any brain.  Or, if you do, it will be one that\nwill have you howling with fear all the time.  Why don't you drop\nthe miserable things when you find they're driving you out of\nyour heads\"\n\n\"Perh-h-h-haps I will,\" muttered the boy.\n\nAfter an early supper, Jim Ferrers rode away.  He offered to leave\nhis rifle in camp, but Tom protested.\n\n\"I'd feel responsible for the thing if you left it here, you know,\nJim.  And I don't want to have to keep toting it around all the\ntime you're away.\"\n\n\"But suppose Dolph Gage and his crew come over here, and you're\nnot armed?\"\n\n\"Then I'll own up that we haven't anything to shoot with, and\nask him to call again,\" Tom laughed.  \"But don't be afraid, Jim.\nGage and his crew will be anxious, for the next few days, to\nsee whether they can coax us into serving them.  They need an\nengineer over at their stolen claim, and they know it.\"\n\nSo Ferrers rode away, carrying his rifle across his saddle.\n\nAlf spent an evening of terror, for the ground around the camp\nappeared to be full of \"rattlers\".\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nHARRY DOES SOME PITCHING\n\n\nAs Tom had surmised, Dolph Gage was anxious to become friends with\nthe young engineers.\n\n\"They're only kids,\" Dolph explained to his comrades, \"but I've\nheard that they know their business.  If we can get their help\nfor a month, then when they hand in their bill we can give them\na wooden check on a cloud bank.\"\n\n\"Their bill would be a claim against our mine wouldn't it?\" asked\none of the other men.\n\n\"Maybe,\" Dolph assented.  \"But, if they try to press it, we can\npay it with lead coin.\"\n\nThe morning after Jim had gone, one of Gage's companions stalked\ninto camp.\n\n\"The boss wants to see you,\" said this messenger.\n\n\"Whose boss?\" Tom inquired.\n\n\"Well, maybe he's yours,\" scowled the messenger.  \"And maybe you'll\nbe sorry if you fool with him.\"\n\n\"I?  Fool with Gage?\" inquired Reade, opening his eyes in pretended\nastonishment.  \"My dear fellow, I've no intention of doing anything\nof the sort.\"\n\n\"Then you'll come over to our camp, right away?\"\n\n\"Nothing like it,\" Tom replied.  \"Kindly present my compliments\nto your boss, and tell him that I have another appointment for\ntoday.\"\n\n\"You'd better come over,\" warned the fellow.\n\n\"You heard what I said, didn't you?\" Reade inquired.\n\n\"There'll sure be trouble,\" insisted the fellow, scowling darkly.\n\n\"There's always trouble for those who are looking for it,\" Tom\nrejoined smilingly.  \"Is Dolph Gage hunting it?\"\n\n\"You'll find out, if you don't come over!\"\n\n\"Really,\" argued Reade, \"we've disposed of that subject, my dear\nfellow.  Have you any other business here!  If not, you'll excuse\nus.  Mr. Hazelton and I are to be gone for the day.\"\n\n\"Going prospecting?\"\n\n\"We're going minding,\" smiled Reade.\n\n\"Mining?\" repeated the visitor.  \"Mining what?\"\n\n\"We are going off to mind our own business,\" Tom drawled.  \"Good\nmorning.\"\n\n\"Then you're not coming over to our place?\"\n\n\"No!\" shouted Harry Hazelton, losing patience.  \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"As you will observe, friend,\" suggested Tom, smiling at the messenger,\n\"my partner has well mastered the lesson that a soft answer is\na soother.\"\n\n\"Are you going to leave our camp?\" Harry demanded, as the visitor\nsquatted on the ground.\n\n\"If you two are going away,\" scowled the other, \"you'll need some one\nto stay and watch the camp. I'll stay for you.\"\n\n\"Come on, Harry!\" Tom called, starting away under the trees.\nAlf Drew had already gone.  Breakfast being over the young cigarette\nfiend had no notion of staying in camp for a share in any trouble\nthat might be brewing.\n\n\"Why on earth are you leaving the camp at that fellow's mercy?\"\nquivered Harry indignantly, as he and Tom got just out of earshot\nof the visitor.\n\n\"Because I suspect,\" Reade returned, \"that he and his crowd want\nto steal our assaying outfit.\"\n\n\"And you're leaving the coast clear for that purpose?\" Hazelton\ngasped in high dudgeon.\n\n\"Now, Harry, is that all you know about me?\" questioned his partner,\nreproachfully.  \"Listen.  Around here you'll find plenty of stones\nof a throwing size.  Just fill your pockets, your hands---your\nhat.  Creep in close to camp and hide.  If you see 'Mr. Sulky'\npoking his nose into anything in our camp---the furnace, for instance,\nor the assay balance, then just drop a stone so near to him that\nit will make him jump.  Be careful that you don't drop a stone\non that balance.  You used to be a pretty fair pitcher, and I\nbelieve you can drop a stone where you want.\"\n\n\"And what will you be doing?\" asked Harry curiously.\n\n\"Oh, I'll be keeping out of harm's way, I promise you,\" laughed\nTom Reade.\n\n\"Humph!  Yes, it would be like you to put me into danger and to\nleave yourself out of it, wouldn't it?\" mocked Harry Hazelton,\nunbelievingly.\n\n\"Well, I'll try to make good use of my time, Harry, old fellow.\nFor one thing, if you haunt camp and keep Gage's crowd busy,\nthen you'll keep them from following or watching me.  Don't you\nsee?\"\n\n\"No; I don't see,\" grunted Hazelton.  \"But what I do suspect is\nthat you have something up your sleeve that I may not find out\nfor two or three days to come.  Yet, whatever it is, it will be\nfor our mutual good.  I can depend upon you, Tom Reade!  Go ahead;\ngo as far as you like.\"\n\n\"Get the stones gathered up, then, and get back to camp,\" counseled\nReade.  \"Don't lose too much time about it, for Gage's rascal\nmay be able to do a lot of harm in the two or three minutes that\nyou might be late in getting back.\"\n\nHarry industriously picked up stones.  Hardly had he started when\nTom Reade silently vanished.\n\n\"Well, I'm glad, anyway, that Tom doesn't want us both away from\ncamp while he's doing something,\" reflected Hazelton, as he began\nto move cautiously back.  \"There wouldn't be any camp by noon\nif we were both away.\"\n\nEven before he secured his first glimpse of camp, Harry heard\nsome one moving about there.\n\n\"The rascal must feel pretty sure that we're both fools enough\nto be away,\" quivered Hazelton indignantly.  \"What on earth is\nhe doing, anyway?\"\n\nThen the young engineer crawled in close enough to get an excellent\nview of what was going on.\n\n\"Well, of all the impudence!\" choked Harry, balancing a stone\nnicely in his right hand.\n\nFirst of all the visitor had rounded up all the firewood into\none heap.  Now, to this combustible material the fellow was bringing\na side of bacon and a small bag of flour.  These he dropped on\nthe firewood, then went back for more of the camp's food supply.\n\n\"Just wait,\" scowled Hazelton.  \"Oh, my fine fellow, I'll make\nyour hands too hot for holding other people's property!\"\n\nOver the brush arched a stone.  Hazelton had been a pitcher in\nhis high school days, and no mistake.  The descending stone fell\nsmack across the back of the fellow's right hand.\n\n\"That's right!  Howl!\" cried Harry, exultantly.  \"Now, for a surprise.\"\n\nThe second stone flew with better speed, carrying away the fellow's\nhat without hitting his head.\n\n\"Hey, you, stop that!\" roared the fellow.\n\nFrom behind the bushes all was quiet.  The camp prowler stood\nup straight, staring to see whence the next stone would come.\nAfter nearly two minutes he bent to pick up the case of biscuit\nthat he had dropped.\n\nSmack!  Even as his nearer hand touched the box a sharp stone\nstruck the back of that hand, cutting a gash and causing the blood\nto spurt.\n\n\"I'll have your scalp for that!\" howled the enraged man.  Making\na pretty good guess at the direction from which the stone had\ncome, the fellow started toward the brush on a run.\n\n\"Here's where you get all of yours!\" chuckled Harry Hazelton.\nStill crouching he let three stones fly one after the other.\nThe first struck the prowler in the mouth, the second on the\nend of the nose and the third over the pit of his stomach.\n\n\"You two-legged Gatling gun!\" howled the fellow, shaking with\nrage and pain.  He halted, shaking his fist in the direction from\nwhich the stones had come.\n\nAnother lot of stones flew toward him.  The prowler waited no\nlonger, but turned, making for Gage's camp as fast as he could go.\n\n\"That ought to hold those rascals for a little while,\" speculated\nHarry.  \"But, of course, there'll be a come-back.  What'll they\ndo to me now, I wonder?\"\n\nBy way of precaution Hazelton cautiously shifted to another hiding\nplace.  Within fifteen minutes he saw the same prowler stealing\nback into camp.  When the fellow was near enough, Harry let fly\na stone that dropped near the rascal's toes.\n\n\"Hey, you stop that, or I'll make you wish you had!\" roared the\nfellow, shaking his fist.\n\nHarry's answer was to drive two more stones in, sending them close\nto the fellow, yet without hitting him.\n\nAgain the man shouted at him, though he did not attempt to come\nany nearer to so expert a thrower of stones.\n\nThen, suddenly, just behind him, Harry Hazelton heard a sound.\nIn the next instant two men hurled themselves upon the young\nengineer, pinning him to the ground.\n\n\"I ought to have suspected this!\" grunted Harry inwardly, as he\nfought back with all his strength.  He might have succeeded in\nslipping away from the two men who sought to pin him down, but\nthe third man, still aching from contact with Harry's missiles,\nnow darted into the scrimmage, striking several hard blows.  Harry\nwas presently conquered and tied.\n\n\"Take the cub to his own camp!\" sounded the exultant voice of\nDolph Gage.  \"With one of the pair tied, it won't be hard to\nhandle the other whenever he happens along.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTOM'S FIGHTING BLOOD SURGES\n\n\n\"Take another hitch of rope around that young steer,\" Dolph ordered,\nafter he had flung Harry violently to the ground.\n\n\"He wont get away as he is,\" replied one of the other two men.\n\n\"Maybe not, but take an extra roping, as I told you,\" was Gage's\ntart retort.\n\nSo another length of line was passed around Hazelton, until he\nfelt as though he had been done up in network.\n\n\"Now; we'll give your partner a chance to show up,\" muttered Gage,\nthrowing himself on the ground.  \"You young fellers will have\nto learn the lesson that you're thirty miles from anywhere, and\nthat we rule matters around here.  We're going to keep on ruling,\ntoo, in this strip of Nevada.\"\n\n\"Are you?\" grimaced Hazelton.  \"Then, my friend, allow me to tell\nyou that you are making the mistake of trying to reckon without\nTom Reade!\"\n\n\"Is that your partner's name?\" jeered Dolph Gage.  \"A likely enough\nboy, from what I've heard of him.  But he isn't old enough to\nunderstand Nevada ways.\"\n\n\"No, perhaps not,\" Harry admitted ironically.  \"So far Tom has\ngotten his training only in Colorado and in Arizona.  I begin\nto realize that he isn't bright enough to have his own way among\nthe bright men of Nevada.  But Reade learns rapidly---don't forget\nthat!\"\n\n\"Huh!\" growled Gage.  \"The young cub seems to think that he has\ncome out here to take charge of the Range.  According to his idea\nhe has only to pick out what he wanted here; and take it.  He\nnever seems to understand that gold belongs to the first man who\nfinds it.  I was on this Range long before Reade was out of school.\"\n\n\"And he doesn't object to your staying here,\" remarked Hazelton\ncalmly.\n\n\"That's good of him, I'm sure,\" snapped Gage.  \"I've no objection\nto his staying here, either.  Fact is, I'm going to encourage both\nof you to stay here.\"\n\n\"Encourage us?\" grinned Harry.\n\n\"Well, then, I'm going to make you stay here, if you like that word\nany better.\"\n\n\"That will be more difficult,\" suggested Hazelton.\n\n\"First of all, we're going to tote your assay outfit over to our\ncamp.  You won't be able to do much without that.  Look around\na bit, Eb,\" added Dolph, turning to one of his companions.  \"Perhaps\nyou'd better get the furnace out first.  Two of you can carry\nit.  I wish we had our other man back from Dugout.  We need hands\nhere.\"\n\n\"Can't you use some of my muscle in helping you to loot our camp?\"\nsuggested Hazelton, ironically.  \"I'm fairly strong, you know.\"\n\n\"Yes; I know you are.  That's why we've tied you up,\" growled\nGage.\n\nThe man addressed as Eb had taken the other fellow aside, and\nthey were now lifting the assay furnace in order to decide how\nheavy it was.\n\n\"It doesn't weigh much over a hundred and fifty pounds,\" called\nout Dolph Gage.  \"Two men like you can get it over to camp.  And\nbring over our guns, too.  It was a mistake to leave 'em over\nin camp.\"\n\nGage watched until the pair were out of sight among the trees.\n\n\"Hurry, you men!\" Gage roared after them.\n\nThen he started in to nose around the camp.\n\nAs he passed a clump of bushes there was a slight stir among them.\nThen Tom Reade leaped forth.\n\nIn a twinkling Dolph Gage had been caught up.  He was in the grip\nof a strong, trained football player.\n\n\"Drop me!\" ordered Gage, with a slight quiver in his voice.\n\n\"I'm going to,\" agreed Tom, hurling the fellow fully a dozen feet.\n\nWith an oath Gage leaped to his feet.  Before he was fairly Tom\nReade's fist caught him in the left eye, sending him to earth\nonce more.\n\n\"Is that the way you fight, you young cub?\" roared Gage hoarsely.\n\n\"I can fight harder if you want me to,\" Tom retorted, as the other\nagain got to his feet.  \"Now, put your hands up, and I'll show you.\"\n\nTom went at it hammer and tongs.  He was a splendidly built young\nathlete, and boxing was one of his strong points, though he rarely\nallowed himself to get into a fight.  Indeed, his usually abounding\ngood nature made all fighting disagreeable to him.  Now, however,\nhe drove in as though Dolph Gage were a punching-bag.\n\n\"Stand up, man, and fight as though you had some sand in you!\" Tom\nordered.  \"Get up steam, and defend yourself.\"\n\n\"I have had enough,\" Gage gasped.  Indeed, his face looked as\nthough he had.\n\n\"Are you a baby?\" Reade demanded contemptuously.  \"Can't you fight\nwith anything but your tongue!\"\n\n\"You wait and I'll show you,\" snarled the badly battered man.\n\n\"What's the need of waiting?\" Tom jeered, and swung in another blow\nthat sent Gage to the ground.\n\n\"Eh!  Josh!\" bellowed Gage, with all the breath he had left.\n\"Hustle o-o-o-over here!\"\n\n\"Let 'em come!\" vaunted Reade.  \"You'll be done for long before\nthey can get here.\"\n\n\"I'll have you killed when they get here with the guns!\" cried\nGage hoarsely.\n\nTom continued to punish his opponent.  Then Dolph, on regaining\nhis feet, sought to run.  Tom let him go a few steps, then bounded\nafter him with the speed of the sprinter.  Gage was caught by\nthe shoulders, swung squarely around, and soundly pummelled.\n\n\"Let up!  Let up!\" begged Gage.  \"I'm beaten.  I admit it.\"\n\n\"Beaten, perhaps, but not punished enough,\" retorted Tom.  As\nDolph would no longer stand up, Reade threw himself upon the fellow\nand pummelled him fearfully.\n\n\"This is no fair fight,\" protested Gage, now fairly sobbing in his\npain and terror, for good-humored Reade seemed to him now to be the\nimpersonation of destroying, fury.\n\n\"Fair fight?\" echoed Reade.  \"Of course it isn't.  This is a\nchastisement.  You villain, you've done nothing but annoy us and\nshoot at us ever since we've met you.  You've got to stop it after\nthis; do you understand?\"\n\n\"I'll stop it---I'll stop it.  Please stop yourself,\" begged Gage,\nnow thoroughly cowed.\n\n\"I'll wager you'll stop,\" gritted Tom.  \"I've never hammered a man\nbefore as I've hammered you, and I'm not half through with you.  By\nthe time I am through with you you'll slink into a corner every time\nyou see me coming near.  You scoundrel, you bully!\"\n\nTom's fists continued to descend.  Dolph's tone changed from one\nof entreaty to one of dire threats.  He would spend the rest of\nhis life, he declared, in dogging Reade's tracks until he succeeded\nin killing the boy.\n\n\"That doesn't worry me any.  You'll experience a change of\nheart---see if you don't,\" Tom rejoined grimly, as he added to the\npounding that the other was receiving.\n\nHarry Hazelton had struggled to his feet, though he had been unable\nto free his hands from the cords that held them behind his back.\n\"You're not talking quite the way you did a few minutes ago, Gage,\"\nHarry put in dryly.\n\n\"You'll see---both of you young pups!\" moaned the battered wretch.\n\"Ask any one, and they'll tell you that Dolph Gage never overlooks\na pounding such as I've had.\"\n\n\"And you got it from the boy that you were going to teach something,\"\njeered Hazelton, \"Gage, you know a little more about Tom Reade, now,\ndon't your?\"\n\nThen Harry straightened up, as he caught sight of moving objects\nin the distance.\n\n\"Get through with him, Tom\" advised the other young engineer.\n\"I see Eb and Josh coming on the run.  They'll have the guns.\nWe've got to look out for ourselves.\"\n\nTom flung the badly beaten man from him where he lay on the ground\nmoaning over his hurts and vowing vengeance on Tom.\n\n\"Stand still, Harry, and I'll have you free in a jiffy,\" Tom\nproposed, hauling out his pocket knife.\n\n\"It won't do for us to stand still too long,\" urged Hazelton,\nas his chum began to slash at the cords.  \"The other scoundrels\nwill kill us when they see what's been going on here.\"\n\n\"No, they won't,\" Tom promised calmly.  \"We'll take care of 'em\nboth.  You wait and see which one I take.  Then you take the other.\nWe'll handle 'em to the finish.\"\n\nThis seemed like foolhardy talk when it was considered that the\nother two men would return armed.  But Harry had unlimited confidence\nin his friend, and so followed Tom, crouching, until they had\nhidden behind bushes along the trail.\n\n\"Where be you, Dolph?\" called the voice of Eb, as the pair drew\nnear.\n\n\"He's over there,\" spoke Reade, springing out of the bushes.\n\"You'll join him after a bit.\"\n\nNeither Eb nor Josh was armed.  Tom sailed into Eb, while Harry\nsprang at Josh.  For a few minutes the trail was a scene of swift\naction, indeed.  Shortly Eb and Josh tried to run away, as Gage\nhad done, but each time the young engineers caught them and compelled\nthem to renew the fight.\n\n\"My man's going to sleep, now, Harry!\" Tom called, and drove in\na knockout blow with his left.\n\nJosh swiftly followed Eb to the ground.\n\n\"They'll keep quiet for a little while,\" declared Tom, after a look\nat each.\n\nDolph Gage had by this time painfully risen to his feet and came\nlimping slowly down the trail.\n\n\"You might look after your friends, Gage,\" Tom called, pointing.\n\"They need attention.\"\n\n\"How did they come to be here?\" gasped Dolph.\n\n\"They'll give you full particulars when they have time,\" Tom laughed.\n\n\"You boys won't feel quite so smart when our turn comes,\" snarled\nGage.\n\n\"Not a bit,\" Reade answered.  \"If you fellows have any sense you'll\nconclude that you've had about all the settlement that you can stand.\"\n\nGage didn't make any answer.  Doubtless he concluded that it wouldn't\nbe wise to talk back So he began working over Eb and Josh, until\nthey showed signs of reviving.\n\n\"Did ye---did ye kill 'em for us, Dolph?\" gasped Josh, as he opened\nhis eyes and beheld the face of his comrade.\n\n\"No,\" said Gage curtly.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Shut up!\"\n\nNot many minutes more had passed when Eb became conscious.\n\n\"You fellows can go over to your camp, any time you want,\" suggested\nTom.\n\nSlowly, painfully, the trio started.\n\n\"I feel almost ashamed of myself,\" Harry muttered.\n\n\"So do I,\" Tom agreed.  \"Yet what else was there for us to do!\nWe've stood all the nonsense we can from that crowd.  They'd have\nkilled us if we hadn't done something to bring them to their senses.\nNow, I believe they'll let us alone.\"\n\n\"They'll ambush us,\" predicted Hazelton\n\n\"Well, they won't have any guns to do it with,\" Tom grinned.\n\n\"Why, what became of their guns\"\n\n\"I'm the only fellow on earth who knows,\" Tom laughed.\n\n\"Then you were at their camp?\"\n\n\"Of course.  My telling you to stone any prowler who visited this\nplace was only a trap.  I thought that he'd run off and get the\nrest of the crew.  Knowing you to be alone and unarmed, and believing\nme to be far away prospecting, they didn't imagine that they'd need\ntheir rifles.  As soon as they left their camp I dropped in and\nborrowed the rifles and all their ammunition.\"\n\n\"Where is the stuff now?\"\n\n\"Come on and I'll show you.\"\n\n\"Hold on a minute,\" begged Harry, as Tom leaped up.  \"Do you miss\nanything?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Our assay furnace.  Eb and Josh carted it away.\"\n\n\"Then we'll go after that, first,\" Tom smiled.  \"Our friends are\nso sore that it would be hardly fair to ask them to return the\nfurnace.\"\n\nThat missing article was found about halfway between the two camps.\nTom and Harry picked it up, carrying it back to where it had\nbeen taken from.  \"Going after the guns, now?\" Hazelton inquired.\n\n\"First of all,\" Tom suggested, \"I think we had better start a\nroaring good campfire.\"\n\n\"What do we want such a thing as that for?\" Harry protested.\n\"The day is warm enough.\"\n\n\"The fire will be just the thing,\" laughed Tom quietly.  \"Come\non and gather the wood with me.  Alf!  Oh, you Alf Drew!\"\n\nBut the cigarette fiend was not in evidence If he heard, he did\nnot answer.\n\n\"We might as well pay that imitation boy for his time and let\nhim go,\" muttered Harry.\n\n\"Oh, I hardly think so,\" dissented Reade.  \"It's worth some time\nand expense to see if we can't make something more nearly resembling\na man out of him.\"\n\nThe fire was soon crackling merrily.  Tom led the way to a thicket\nan eighth of a mile from camp.  Here he produced from hiding three\nrepeating rifles and several boxes of ammunition.\n\n\"We'll hold on to these,\" Hazelton said.\n\n\"For what reason?\"\n\n\"They'll come in handy to steer off that other crowd.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't be bothered with keeping the rifles about camp,\" Tom\nretorted, as they started backward.\n\n\"But say!  Gage's man that went to Dugout will soon be back.\nDo you forget that he carries a rifle?\"\n\n\"Jim Ferrers will be back at about the same time,\" Tom rejoined.\n\"They'll have rifles until the camp will look like an outdoor\narsenal.  We don't want these added rifles around camp.  Besides,\nif we kept 'em we'd soon begin to feel like thieves with other\nfolks' property.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do with these guns, then?\"\n\n\"By tomorrow,\" Reade proposed, \"I rather expect to put these guns\nout where Gage's crew can find them again.\"\n\n\"Well, you're full of faith in human nature, then!\" gasped Harry.\n\n\"Wait and see what happens,\" begged Tom.\n\nWhen they stepped back into camp Tom threw the magazine of one\nof the rifles open, extracting the cartridges.  Then he stepped\nover and carefully deposited the rifle across the middle of the\nfire.\n\n\"I might have known!\" cried Hazelton.\n\nThe other two rifles were soon disposed of in the same manner.\n\n\"Let the rifles cook in the fire for an hour,\" smiled Reade,\"\nand the barrels will be too crooked for a bullet ever to get through\none again.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do with the cartridges, though?\"\n\n\"Fire a midnight salute with them,\" Tom answered briefly.  \"Wait\nand you'll hear some noise.\"\n\nAlf Drew cautiously approached camp when he felt the pangs of\nhunger.  The cigarette fiend must have been satisfied, for Tom\nand Harry had already gotten the meal.  But Reade, without a word\nof rebuke to their supposed helper, allowed young Drew to help\nhimself to all he wanted in the way of hot food and coffee.\n\nBringing midnight two hours nearer---that is to say, at ten o'clock,\nTom and Harry, aided this time by Alf, built a large fire-pile\nin a gully at a safe distance from camp.  The wood was saturated\nwith oil, a powder flash laid, then Tom laid a fuse-train.  Lighting\nthe fuse, the three speedily decamped.\n\nPresently they saw the flames of the newly kindled fire shooting\nup through the trees.  Then the volleying began, for Tom had carefully\ndeposited through the fire-pile all the captured cartridges.\n\nFor fully five minutes the cartridges continued to explode, in\nragged volleys.\n\n\"It's a regular Fourth of July,\" Harry laughed, back in camp.  \"Tom,\nwho's going to take the first trick of watch tonight?\"\n\n\"Neither one of us,\" Reade replied.  \"We'll both get a sound sleep.\"\n\nBut the enemy?\"\n\n\"It would take four mules apiece to drag them over here tonight,\"\nlaughed Reade, as he rolled himself up in his blanket.  \"Good\nnight!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nPLANNING A NEW MOVE\n\n\nBarely were the young engineers astir the following morning when\nAlf Drew came racing back with news.\n\n\"There's a whole slew of men coming, on horseback and on foot!\"\nAlf reported.  \"And a whole train of wagons!\"\n\n\"Good enough!\" nodded Tom.  \"I hope the new folks camp right close\nto here.  We need good neighbors more than anything else.\"\n\n\"But they may belong to Gage's crowd,\" Alf insisted.\n\n\"Don't you believe it, lad.  Dolph Gage hasn't money enough to\nfinance a crowd like that.\"\n\n\"It may be Dunlop's crowd,\" suggested Hazelton.\n\n\"That's more likely,\" said Tom.  \"Well we'll be glad enough to\nsee Dunlop back here with a outfit.  This part of the woods will\nsoon be a town, at that rate.\"\n\n\"Come out where you can get a look a new crowd,\" urged Alf.\n\n\"If it's any one who wants to be neighborly,\" Reade answered with\na shake of his head, \"he's bound to stop in and say 'howdy.' We're\ngoing to get breakfast now.\"\n\n\"Then I'll be back soon, and tell you anything I can find out\nabout the new folks,\" cried Alf, darting away.\n\nBut Tom raced after the lad, collaring him.\n\n\"Alf, listen to me.  We're not paying you to come in on time to\nget your meals.  You get over there by Jim's cooking outfit and\nbe ready to take orders.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" grunted young Drew, but he went as directed, for there\nwas nothing else to do.\n\nFive minutes later Mr. Dunlop turned his horse's head and rode\ndown into the camp.\n\n\"Howdy, boys!\" called the mine promoter.\n\n\"Glad to see you back, Mr. Dunlop,\" Tom nodded, while Harry smiled\na welcome.\n\n\"I've sent my outfit around by the other trail,\" explained Mr.\nDunlop.  \"I've brought back men enough to start work in earnest.\nThere will be a mule train here by tomorrow with donkey engines\nand machinery enough to start the work of mine-digging in earnest.\nHere, boy, take my horse and tie him.\"\n\nAs Alf led the animal away, Mr. Dunlop turned to the young engineers\nwith a smile of great amiability.\n\n\"Boys, I'm glad to say that I wired the two railroad presidents\nyou mentioned to me.  Both wired back, in effect, that my mine\nwas bound to be a success if I turned the engineering problem\nover to you.  So I'm going to accept your offers---hire you at\nyour own figures.  I want you to come over to the Bright Hope\nclaim as soon as you've had breakfast.\"\n\nTom glanced at his chum, then answered, slowly:\n\n\"I'm sorry, Mr. Dunlop, sorry indeed, if-----\"\n\n\"What are you trying to say?\" demanded the mine promoter sharply.\n\n\"When you left here, Mr. Dunlop, we told you that we couldn't agree\nto hold our offer open.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right.  I've come right back and taken up your\nterms with you,\" replied the promoter easily.\n\n\"But I'm sorry to say, sir, that you are too late.\"\n\n\"Too late?  What are you talking about, Reade?  You haven't entered\nthe employ of any one else not in this wilderness.\"\n\n\"We've formed a partnership with Ferrers, sir,\" Reade gravely\ninformed Mr. Dunlop, \"and we're going into the mining business\non our own account.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!  Where's your claim?\"\n\n\"Somewhere, sir, in this part of Nevada.\"\n\n\"You haven't found the claim yet, then?\" asked the promoter, with\na tinge of relief in his voice.\n\n\"No, sir.  We located a promising claim, but the Gage gang tricked\nus out of it.  We'll find another, though.\"\n\n\"Then you'll prove yourselves very talented young men,\" scoffed\nMr. Dunlop.  \"Lad, don't you know that I've been all over this\ncountry with old-time prospectors?  There isn't any claim left\nthat will pay you for the trouble of locating and working it.\"\n\n\"We're going to hope for better luck than your words promise us,\nsir,\" Harry hinted.\n\n\"You'll have your labor for your pains, then, and the satisfaction\nof finding yourselves fools,\" exclaimed Dunlop testily.  \"You'd\nbetter drop all that nonsense, and report to me after breakfast.\"\n\n\"It's not to be thought of, Mr. Dunlop,\" Tom replied gravely.\n\"We are here in the land of gold.  We think we see our chance\nto work for ourselves for a while, and we're going to make the\nmost of our chance.\"\n\n\"Then you're a pair of idiots,\" quivered indignant Dunlop.\n\n\"We'll be our own fools, then,\" smiled Harry.\n\n\"I beg your pardon for getting out of patience,\" spoke Mr. Dunlop,\nmore gently.  \"I'm disappointed in you.  All the way here I have\nbeen planning to get you both at work early.  The stockholders in\nthe Bright Hope are all looking for early results.\"\n\n\"Couldn't you get hold of an engineer at Dugout?\" Tom inquired.\n\n\"Not one.\"\n\n\"Then you'll have to go farther---Carson City,\" Reade suggested.\n\"There must be plenty of mining engineers in Nevada, where their\nservices are so much in demand.\"\n\n\"A lot of new claims are being filed these days,\" explained Mr.\nDunlop.  \"The best I could learn in Dugout was that I'd have to\nwait until some other mine could spare its man.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry we can't help you, sir,\" Tom went on thoughtfully.\n\n\"I shall feel it a personal grievance, if you don't,\" snapped\nthe mine promoter.\n\n\"We can't do anything for you, Mr. Dunlop,\" spoke Reade decisively.\n\"Just as soon as Ferrers returns, so that our camp can be taken\ncare of, we three partners are going to hustle out on the prospect.\nWill you have breakfast with us, sir?\"\n\nMr. Dunlop assented, but his mind was plainly on his disappointment\nall through the meal.\n\nEven when Harry Hazelton related how Dolph Gage and his crew had\nbeen served, the mine promoter displayed but little enthusiasm.\n\n\"By the way, sir,\" suggested Tom, \"you are not going to use all\nof your men today?\"\n\n\"I cannot use any of them for a day or two.\"\n\n\"Then you might do us a great favor by sending a few of your men\nover here.  I expect that Gage's absent comrade will return at\nany time.  He will have his rifle, and one gun in the hands of a\nmarksman, might be enough to make considerable trouble around\nhere.\"\n\n\"You ask me a favor, and yet you won't work for me,\" complained\ntheir guest.\n\n\"I think we did you a favor, once upon a time, by helping to chase\noff the Gage crowd at a critical time for you,\" said Tom bluntly.\n\"However, if you don't wish-----\"\n\n\"I'll send half a dozen men over here until Ferrers returns,\"\ninterjected Mr. Dunlop hastily.\n\nThe men reported to Tom and Harry within half an hour.  A few minutes\nafter their arrival Harry espied Dolph Gage's absent man galloping\nover to the Gage claim.\n\n\"There would have been trouble, if we hadn't shown a few armed men\nhere,\" muttered Hazelton.\n\n\"There's some excitement in that camp, as it is,\" exclaimed Tom,\nwho had a pair of binoculars at his eyes.  \"Gage, Eb and Josh\nare crowding around the new arrival.  Take the glasses, Harry.\nNote how excited they are about something.\"\n\n\"Gage is stamping about and looking wild,\" Harry reported.  \"He\nlooks as though, for two cents, he'd tear his hair out.  And Eb\nhas thrown his hat on the ground and is stamping on it.  I wonder\nwhat the trouble can be?\"\n\nTwo hours later Jim Ferrers rode into camp at the head of his\nnew outfit.  He had the two-mule team and wagon, and seven men,\nall miners and armed.  Two of the men rode the ponies that Reade\nhad instructed Jim to buy.\n\n\"Jim,\" called Tom, as he ran toward their mining party, \"have\nyou any idea what's wrong with the Gage crowd?\"\n\n\"I've a small notion,\" grinned the guide.  \"The man who was sent\nover couldn't file their claim to the ridge.\"\n\n\"Couldn't file it!  Why not?\"\n\n\"Because every man in that crowd has exhausted his mineral land\nprivileges taking up claims elsewhere.\"\n\n\"Why, then, man alive!\" gasped Tom, halting, a look of wonder\non his face, and then a grin of realization, \"if they can't file\nthe claim to that strip, why can't we!\"\n\n\"We can, if we're quick enough,\" Ferrers answered.  \"I tried to\nfile the claim while I was over in Dugout, but the clerk at the\nmining claim office said he 'lowed that we'd have to have our\ndeclaration tacked up on the ridge first of all.\"\n\n\"That'll take us a blessed short time,\" muttered Reade.  \"Harry\nand I have all the particulars we need for writing out the notice\nof claim.  Get some breakfast on the jump, Jim, and we'll hustle\nover there.\"\n\n\"I had my breakfast before I rode in here,\" errors answered, his\neyes shining.  \"I'd a-missed my guess, Mr. Reade, if you hadn't\nbeen ready for prompt action.\"\n\n\"Then there's no reason, Jim, under mining customs, why we shouldn't\nride over there and stake out that claim?\"\n\n\"Not a reason on earth, Mr. Reade, except that Gage will probably\nput up a big fight.\"\n\n\"Let him!\" added Tom, in a lower voice.  \"Take it from me, Jim\nFerrers, that claim on the ridge yonder is worth all kinds of\nfight.  Here, get the horses saddled again, while Harry and I\nwrite our notice in record-breaking time for legible penmanship.\"\n\nTom's eyes were gleaming in a way that they had not done in months.\nFor, despite his former apparent indifference to the trick Gage\nhad played on them, Tom Reade would have staked his professional\nreputation on the richness of the ridge claim.\n\n\"It's gold, Harry---gold!\" he exclaimed, hoarsely, in his chum's\near.  \"It's gold enough to last us through life if we work it\nhard from the start.\"\n\n\"We'll have to kill a few men before we can get Gage off that\nridge, though,\" Hazelton predicted.\n\n\"It's gold, I tell you, Harry.  When the gold-craze gets into\na fellow's blood nothing but gold can cure it.  We won't kill\nany one, and we'll hope not to be killed ourselves.  But that\nclaim was our discovery, and now the way is clear for us to own\nthat strip of Nevada dirt.  Gold, Harry, old chum---gold!\"\n\nThen they fell to writing.  Harry did the pen work while Reade\ndictated rapidly.\n\nIf Engineer Tom Reade had been briefly excited he did not betray\nthe fact when he stepped outside the tent.\n\n\"Horses saddled, Mr. Reade,\" announced Ferrers.  \"I s'pose you're\ngoing to take some of the boys over with us, in case Gage tries\nto put up any shooting bluff?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" nodded Tom.  \"But don't take with us any fellow who is\nhot-blooded enough to do any real shooting.\"\n\n\"It'll take real shooting to get Gage's crew off that ridge,\"\nFerrers warned the young engineer.  \"All men get gold crazy when\nthey find their feet on a claim.  Dolph Gage will fight while\nhe has breath left.  Don't try to go over there, sir, if you're\nnot satisfied to have a little shooting done at need.\"\n\n\"We're going over,\" declared Tom, the lines about his mouth tightening,\n\"and we're going to take the claim for our own, as long as we\nhave the legal right to do so.  But I hope there won't have to\nbe any gun-powder burned.  Killing belongs only to one line of\nbusiness---war!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nNEW OWNERS FILE A CLAIM\n\n\nDolph Gage, after his richly deserved battering of the day before,\npresented a sorry-looking sight as he stood near the notice of\nhis claim location.\n\nIn his right hand he gripped the only rifle there now was in his\noutfit, the one brought back by the man who had been to Dugout.\n\nJim Ferrers, rifle resting across the front of his saddle, rode\nat the head of the Reade-Hazelton party as that outfit reached\nthe edge of the claim.\n\nOn either side of the guide, just to the rear, rode Tom and Harry.\nBehind them tramped four men armed with rides, the other two\nmen carrying a board, stakes and a hammer.\n\n\"The first man who sets foot on this claim dies!\" shouted Dolph\nGage hoarsely.\n\n\"Same thing for any man who raises a rifle against us,\" Ferrers\ncalled back.  \"Gage, I want only a good excuse for taking one\nhonest shot at you!\"\n\nThe moment was tense with danger.  Heedless of the black looks\nof Dolph, Tom dug his heels into his pony's flanks, moving forward\nat a trot.\n\n\"Gage,\" called the young engineer, steadily, \"I think you have been\nin wrong often enough.  This time I am sure that you will want to keep\non the right side.\"\n\n\"You keep on the right side by staying off the claim!\" Gage ordered,\nbut at that instant Reade rode over the boundary.\n\nFor an instant no man could guess who would fire the first shot.\nGage was angry and desperate enough to fire and take great chances.\nHad he fired at that moment there was no doubt that he would have\nbeen killed at the next breath.\n\nSomething stuck in Gage's throat.  He did not raise his rifle, but\ninstead he growled:\n\n\"You're a fine lot, to bring a small army against one man!\"\n\n\"We have as much right here, Gage, as you have, spoke Tom, steadily.\n\n\"What do you want here!\"\n\n\"We have come to look this claim over.\"\n\n\"Get off, then.  You have no right here.\"\n\n\"You know, quite well, Gage, that we have as much right here as\nyou have,\" Tom rejoined easily.  \"We are quite well aware that\nyour man failed to file the claim because all of you have exhausted\nyour mineral rights under the law.\n\n\"So you think you can come here and take it from us, do you?\" glared\nGage, his face livid with passion.\n\n\"We have just the same right to this claim now that any man has\nwho has any mineral rights left under the law,\" Reade made answer.\n\n\"But you haven't.  I'm going to get this claim yet,\" Gage insisted.\n\"I've sent for a friend who hasn't taken up any mineral rights yet.\nHe will file the claim.  See here!\"\n\nGage moved aside, displaying a new board, on which a notice had\nbeen written.\n\n\"That's signed with the name of the man the claim belongs to now,\"\ndeclared Gage, triumphantly.\n\nTom handed his bridle to Harry, then dismounted, bending over\nto scan the new notice.  It was a duplicate of the former one,\nexcept that the new signature was that of one, Joseph Pringle.\n\n\"Where is Pringle?\" Tom demanded.\n\n\"None of your business.\"\n\n\"But you see,\" explained the young engineer dryly, \"it happens to be\nmy business.\"\n\nFrom under his coat Reade drew forth a folding camera.  Quickly\nopening and focussing he held the camera close, pressing the bulb.\n\n\"That photograph will enlarge to almost any size,\" Tom declared.\n\"Now, then, Gage, do you claim that this strip has been claimed\nby one, Pringle?\"\n\n\"I do,\" scowled Gage, \"and Pringle is our partner.  We're going\nto work this claim with him, and you're trespassing.\"\n\n\"Is that Pringle's own signature?\" Tom insisted.\n\n\"None of your business!\"\n\n\"You've given me that same kind of an answer before,\" Tom smiled.\n\"As it happens, this is our business.  Gage, the writing of that\nnotice looks exactly like your writing, and Pringle's alleged\nsignature is in the same hand-writing.  If you've signed Pringle's\nname---and I charge that you have---then that notice has no legal\nvalue whatever.  Recollect, I have a photograph of the notice\nand signature, and that this notice in turn, so that you may remember\nthat the writing throughout is the same that my photograph is going\nto reveal.\"\n\nJim Ferrers quickly came forward.  Gage stepped squarely in front\nof the board holding the notice.  But Tom took a swift step forward.\nGage, shaking, drew back out of possible reach of Reade's fists.\n\nThen, one after the other, the other members of Tom's party inspected\nthe writing.\n\n\"Much good may it do you!\" jeered Dolph Gage harshly.  \"You'll\nfind that this claim is ours!\"\n\n\"Look at what that cub is doing!\" broke in Eb excitedly, pointing\nto Harry.\n\nUnobserved at first by others, Hazelton had slipped back of the\ncrowd.  Now he was placing a board in position, and that board\nannounced the fact that Jim Ferrers had staked out this strip\nfor himself.\n\n\"Take that down!\" raged Gage, as soon as he saw the new board\nand paper.  \"It won't do you any good.\"\n\n\"We'll take a chance on it, anyway, and watch it for a few days,\"\nJim declared.  \"Are you through with me now, Mr. Reade?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" nodded Tom.\n\nMounting his horse, Jim Ferrers rode away at an easy gait.\n\n\"This is a mean trick to try to play on us, Reade,\" snarled Gage.\n\n\"If you hadn't played a mean trick on us, and staked this place\noff while you knew we were making the assay of ore taken from\nhere,\" rejoined Tom, \"then we might be inclined to waive the purely\nlegal side of the case and give you a fair chance to get your\nfriend Pringle here.  But you must remember that you tricked us\nout of this claim in the first place, and now you have no right\nat all to complain.  This claim now stands in Jim Ferrers's name,\nand so it will continue to stand.\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" snarled Gage.  \"Try to take ore out of here.  No man\nshall be a partner in this claim and live to spend any of the\nmoney he gets out of this mine!  I've said it, and I'll pledge\nmyself to back it up.\"\n\n\"And you've made that threat before witnesses, also, Gage.  Remember\nthat,\" Tom advised sternly.\n\n\"And all the time you're chinning, Dolph,\" broke in Josh, \"Jim\nFerrers is riding hard for Dugout City to file the new claim entry!\"\n\n\"If he is, something may happen to him on the way!\" raged Dolph,\nwheeling about like a flash.  His saddle horse, ready for action,\nstood tied to a tree near by.  Gage leaped into his saddle after\nhe had freed the horse.\n\n\"Boss, he's going after Ferrers, to do him harm on the road,\"\nhoarsely whispered one of Tom's new miners.  \"Are you going to\nlet the scoundrel start?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" nodded Tom coolly, \"at Ferrers's special request.  He didn't\nwant Gage stopped from trying to overtake him.\"\n\nGage was now galloping away.\n\n\"You've seen the last of Ferrers,\" jeered Josh, after Gage had\nvanished in the distance.\n\n\"Perhaps we've seen the last of one of the men,\" replied Reade\ncoldly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nJIM TRIES THE NEW WAY\n\n\n\"I've attended to the firm's business,\" exclaimed Jim Ferrers,\nwrathfully, on his return to camp.  \"I filed the papers at Dugout\nCity, and the claim now stands in my name, though it belongs to\nthe firm.  And now, having attended to the firm's business, I'm\ngoing out to settle some of my own.\"\n\n\"What business is that!\" Tom inquired over the supper table.\n\nIt was three days after the morning on which Ferrers had ridden\naway.\n\n\"That mongrel dog, Dolph Gage, took a shot at me this afternoon!\"\nFerrers exploded wrathfully.  \"I'd ought to have gotten him years\nago.  Now I'm going to drop all other business and find the fellow.\"\n\n\"What for?\" Tom inquired innocently.\n\n\"What for?\" echoed Jim, then added, ironically: \"Why, I want to do\nthe hyena a favor, of course.\"\n\n\"If you go out to look for him, you're not going armed, are you?\"\nReade pursued.\n\n\"Armed?\" repeated Ferrers, with withering sarcasm.  \"Oh, no, of\ncourse not.  I'm going to ride up to him with my hands high in\nthe air and let him take a shot at me.\"\n\n\"Jim,\" drawled Tom, \"I'm afraid there's blood in your eye---and not\nyour own blood, either.\"\n\n\"Didn't that fellow kill my brother in a brawl?\" demanded Ferrers.\n\"Hasn't he pot-shotted at me?  And didn't he do it again this\nafternoon?\"\n\n\"Why didn't the law take up Gage's case when your brother was\nkilled?\" Tom inquired.\n\n\"Well, you see, Mr. Reade,\" Ferrers admitted, \"my brother had a hasty\ntemper, and he drew first---but Gage fired the killing shot.\"\n\n\"So that the law would say that Gage fired in self-defense, eh?\"\n\n\"That's what a coroner's jury did say,\" Jim admitted angrily.\n\"But my brother was a young fellow, and hot-headed.  Gage knew\nhe could provoke the boy into firing, and then, when the boy missed,\nGage drilled him through the head.\"\n\n\"I don't want to say anything unkind, Jim,\" Reade went on,\nthoughtfully.  \"Please don't misunderstand me.  But, as I\nunderstand the affair, if your brother hadn't been carrying a\npistol he wouldn't have been killed?\"\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" Ferrers grudgingly admitted.\n\n\"Then the killing came about through the bad practice of carrying a\nrevolver?\"\n\n\"Bad practice!\" snorted Jim.  \"Well, if that's a bad practice\nmore'n half the men in the state have the vice.\"\n\n\"Popular custom may not make a thing right,\" argued Reade.\n\n\"But what are you going to do when the men who have a grudge against\nyou pack guns?\" Jim queried, opening his eyes very wide.\n\n\"I've had a few enemies---bad ones, too, some of them,\" Tom answered\nslowly.  \"Yet I've always refused to carry an implement of murder,\neven when I've been among rough enemies.  And yet I'm alive.\nIf I had carried a pistol ever since I came West I'm almost certain\nthat I'd be dead by this time.\"\n\n\"But if you won't carry a gun, and let folks suspect you of being\na white-flagger, then you get the reputation of being a coward,\"\nargued Ferrers.\n\n\"Then I suppose I've been voted a coward long ago,\" Reade nodded.\n\n\"No, by the Great Nugget, you're not a coward,\" retorted Ferrers.\n\"No man who has seen you in a tough place will ever set you down\nfor a coward.\"\n\n\"Yet I must be, if I don't tote a gun in a wild country,\" smiled\nReade.\n\n\"But to go back to the case of that good-for-nothing, Dolph Gage,\"\nJim Ferrers resumed.  \"You advise me to forget that he shot at me?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, I don't,\" Tom retorted quietly.  \"But you don't have to go\nout and take your own revenge.  There are laws in this state,\naren't there?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"And officers to execute the laws\"\n\n\"To be sure.\"\n\n\"Then why not go back to Dugout City, there to lay information\nagainst Gage.  That done, the sheriff's officers will have to\ndo the hunting.  Having nothing personal against the officers,\nGage will very likely hold up his hands when the officers find\nhim, and then go back with them as peaceable as a lamb.  Jim,\nyou want to be even with Gage for shooting your brother and for\ntrying to finish you.  Won't it give you more satisfaction to\nfeel that you've put Gage day for his bread and water?  I know\nthat is the way I'd want to punish a man that I had cause to hate.\nAt least, I believe it's the way; I don't really know, for I\ncan't recall any man that I hate hard enough to wish him worse\nthan out of my sight.\"\n\n\"Say, it would be kinder funny to go up to the state 'pen' some\nday, and see Dolph Gage walking lock-step with a lot of rascally\nChinamen, drunken Indians, Knife-sticking foreigners and sassy\nbill-collectors, wouldn't it?\" grinned Jim Ferrers.\n\n\"I'm glad your sense of humor is improving,\" smiled Tom Reade.\n\"Now, tomorrow, morning, Jim, you take two of the other men,\nand our ponies, and ride into Dugout.  If you run across Gage\ndon't try to pick up any trouble.  Of course, I don't mean to say\nthat you shouldn't shoot in self-defense if you're attacked, but\ntry, if possible, to keep out of any trouble with Gage.  Just\nsave him for the sheriff.  It's the law's business to handle such\nfellows.  Let the law have its own way.\"\n\n\"I'll do it,\" promised Ferrers.  \"Putting it the way you've done,\nMr. Reade, it doesn't seem like such a baby trick to use the sheriff\ninstead of killing the hyena, myself.  Yes; I'll sure leave it\nto the law.  If Dolph Gage gets caught and sent to the 'pen' I'll\nsure go there on some visiting day and see how he looks in his\nstriped suit!\"\n\nInstead of being offended, it was plain that Ferrers was in high\ngood humor.  He went about camp whistling that night, and with\na cheery word for everyone.\n\nCamp had been moved over to the ridge, and the young engineers\nwere ready to begin blasting operations the following morning.\nFerrers was no longer concerned with cooking, he having engaged\na man to do that work.  The new man kept a sharp eye on Alf Drew,\nmaking that youngster do a really honest day's work every day\nin the week.\n\n\"I hate to take two men from you, Mr. Reade right at the start\nof operations,\" complained Jim, the next morning at breakfast.\n\"I don't need two men, either, to protect me.\"\n\n\"I don't need the two men here, either, Jim for a few days.  As\nfor you, you don't know how many men you are going to need.  All\nthree of Gage's partners have vanished, and I'm sure that they're\ntogether somewhere out on the Range.  They undoubtedly have rifles\nagain, at that, and if you meet them, three men won't be any too\nmany to stand off those four rascals.\"\n\nTom watched the trio of horsemen out of sight in the morning.\n\n\"If Jim doesn't lose his head that trip will mean that we shall\nsee the last of Dolph Gage,\" mused the young engineer.\n\nFor once Tom Reade was in grave error, as subsequent events proved.\n\n\"It's ten minutes of seven,\" Harry reminded him.\n\n\"Get ready, men,\" Tom shouted to their few laborers, who were\nenjoying a few minutes leisure after breakfast.\n\nAt seven o'clock the young engineers and their handful of toilers\nmoved over to the point in the outcropping vein of ore that Reade\nhad selected for their first blast.\n\nA small portable engine had already been fired, and all was ready\nfor turning on the steam drill.\n\nTwenty minutes later a satisfactory boring had been made.\n\n\"Bring up the dynamite,\" called Tom.\n\n\"Are you going to pack the charge?\" Harry inquired.\n\n\"Yes,\" nodded Tom, and received the stick of dynamite from the\nminer who brought it.\n\nWhile this was being made ready, Hazelton superintended the laying\nof the wires to the magneto battery.  All was soon in readiness.\n\n\"The red flag is up,\" Tom shouted.\n\nThe dynamite had been rather loosely tamped home, for young Reade\nwanted to begin with light rending force and work up, through\nsuccessive blasts, to just the proper amount of force.\n\n\"Get back, everybody!\" Reade called, and there was a flying of\nfeet.  Tom was last to leave the spot.  He ran over to where Harry\nstood at a safe distance.\n\n\"Pump her up, Harry,\" nodded the young chief engineer.\n\n\"You watch me, and see just how I run this magneto,\" Hazelton\nsaid to one of their men who stood near by.  \"This will be your\njob after we've fired a few charges.  I want you to get the hang\nof the trick.\"\n\nHarry worked the handle of the magneto up and down.\n\nBang!  Over where the drilling had been done a mass of dirt and\nrock was shot up into the air.\n\n\"What are you running so fast for, Harry?\" laughed Tom, as he pursued\nhis chum back to the scene of the blast.\n\n\"I want to see if we stirred up any real ore.  I want to know if our\nclaim is worth the grub it takes to feed the men,\" was Hazelton's\nalmost breathless response.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHE COOK LEARNS A LESSEN\n\n\nArrived on the spot it took Tom only a moment to estimate that\nconsiderably less than a quarter of a ton of ore had been loosened\nfrom the rock bed by the blast.\n\n\"We'll drill six inches deeper next time, and put in fifty per\ncent. more dynamite,\" Reade decided.\n\nThe men brought up the drill and set it, after which the engineer\nwas signaled.\n\nHarry, in the meantime, was down on his hands and knees, curiously\nturning over the small, loose bits of rock.\n\n\"Stung, if this stuff proves anything,\" sighed Hazelton.\n\n\"You can't judge by one handful, Harry,\" Tom told him.  \"Besides,\nwe may have to get down twenty, or even fifty feet below surface\nbefore we strike any pay-stuff.  Don't look for dividends in the\nfirst hour.  I've been told that gold-mining calls for more sporting\nblood than any other way in which wealth can be pursued.\"\n\n\"But I don't find a bit of color in this stuff,\" Harry muttered.\n\"If we're on the top of a vein of gold it seems to me that we\nought to find a small speck of yellow here and there.\"\n\nA dozen blasts were made that morning.  When the men knocked off\nat noon Harry Hazelton's face bore a very serious expression.\n\n\"Tom,\" he murmured to his partner, \"I'm afraid we have a gold brick\nof a gold mine.\"\n\n\"It's an even chance,\" nodded Reade.\n\n\"And think of all the money---out of our savings---we've sunk\nin this thing.\"\n\n\"I hope you're not going to get scared as early as this,\" protested\nTom.  \"Why, before we even get in sight of pay-rock we may have\nto sink every dollar of our savings.\"\n\n\"Then hadn't we better get out of it early, and go to work for\nsome one who pays wages?\" questioned Hazelton.\n\n\"Yes,\" Tom shot out, quickly, \"if that's the way you feel about it.\"\n\n\"But do you feel differently, Tom?\"\n\n\"I'm willing to risk something, for the sake of drawing what may\npossibly turn out to be the big prize in the mining lottery.\"\n\n\"But all our savings,\" cried Harry, aghast.  \"That seems like\na foolish risk, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"If you say so, I'll draw out now,\" Tom proposed.\n\n\"What do you think about it?\"\n\n\"If all the money at stake were mine,\" Reade said slowly, \"then\nI'd hang on as long as I had a penny left to invest.\"\n\n\"Tom Reade, I believe you're turning gambler at heart!\"\n\n\"I intend to be a good, game business man, if that's what you\nmean by gambling.  But see here, Harry, I don't want to pull your\nmoney into this scheme if you feel that you'd rather hold on to\nwhat you have.\"\n\n\"If you're going to stay in, Tom, then so am I.  I'm not the kind\nof fellow to go back on a chum's investment.\"\n\n\"But if we lose all we've saved then you'll feel-----\"\n\n\"Don't argue any more, Tom,\" begged Hazelton.  \"I'm going to be\ngame.  You've voted, old fellow, to stay by this claim as long\nas you can, and that's enough for me.\"\n\n\"But if we lose all our savings,\" Tom urged.  He had now become\nthe cautious one.\n\n\"If we lose them, we lose them,\" declared Hazelton.  \"And we're\nboth of us young enough to be able to save more before we're\nseventy-five or eighty years old.  Go ahead, Tom.  I'm one of the\ninvestors here, but the whole game is in your hands.  Go as far\nas you like and I'll stand back of you.\"\n\n\"But-----\"\n\n\"Say no more.  Tom, I shall try never again to be a quitter.\nWhoop!  Let the money slip!  We'll make the old mine a dividend\npayer before we are through with it.\"\n\nThat afternoon about a dozen and a half more blasts were laid\nand fired.  Some five hundred feet of the surface of the vein\nhad been lightly blasted, and several tons of ore thrown up.\n\n\"I wouldn't call it ore, though,\" muttered Harry to himself.\n\"I don't believe this rook holds gold enough to put a yellow plating\non a cent.\"\n\n\"It does look rather poor, doesn't it, Harry?\" Tom asked, trying\nto speak blithely.\n\n\"Humph!  We've got to go deeper than this before we can expect\nto loosen rock worth thirty dollars to the ton,\" Harry declared\ncheerily.\n\n\"Oh, we'll surely strike pay-rock in big lots after a while,\"\npredicted Reade, smiling happily and whistling merrily as he strode\naway.  \"I'm glad Harry has his courage with him and his hopes high,\"\nReade added to himself.\n\n\"I'm glad Tom is so cheerful and positive,\" thought Hazelton.\n\"I'll do my best to help him keep in that frame of mind; though,\nfor myself, I believe we would make more money if we stood on\na cliff and tossed pennies into the ocean.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to see that all your high hopes have returned,\" declared\nTom, at supper that evening.\n\n\"Oh, I've got the gold fever for fair,\" laughed Hazelton.  \"Tom, how\nare we going to spend the money when we get it?\"\n\n\"A new house for the folks at home will take some of my money, when\nI get it,\" Tom declared, his eyes glowing.\n\n\"Any old thing that the folks take a fancy to will catch my share\nof the gold,\" Harry promised.\n\n\"But, of course, we'll wait until we get it.\"\n\n\"You haven't any doubts about getting the gold, have you?\"\n\n\"Not a doubt.  Have you?\"\n\n\"I'm an optimist,\" Harry asserted.\n\n\"What's your idea of an optimist, anyway?\" laughed Tom.\n\n\"An optimist is a fellow who believes that banknotes grow on potato\nvines,\" laughed Harry.\n\n\"Oh, we'll get our gold all right,\" Reade predicted.\n\n\"We will, and a lot more.  Tom, you and I still have mineral rights\nthat we can file, with Ferrers as trustee.\"\n\n\"We'll go prospecting for two more bully claims just as soon as\nwe begin to see pay-rock coming out of this vein,\" Tom planned.\n\"Alf, you lazy cigarette fiend, hurry up and bring me some more\nof the canned meat.\"\n\n\"Bring me another cup of coffee on the jump,\" called Harry.  \"While\nyou're about it make it two cups of coffee.\"\n\nAs soon as he had brought the required things Alf tried slyly to\nslip away by himself, for he had already had his own supper.\n\n\"Here, you son of the shiftless one, get back here and drag the\ngrub to this table,\" yelled one of the men at the miners' table.\n\nAfter that Alf remained on duty until all hands had been fed.\nThen he tried to slip away again, only to be roped by a lariat in\nthe hands of the new cook.\n\n\"Let me catch you trying to sneak away from work again, and I'll\ncowhide you with this rope,\" growled the cook.  \"Why are you trying\nto sneak away before your work is finished?\"\n\n\"I'm almost dead for a smoke,\" said Alf.\n\n\"Smoke, is it?  You stay here and wash the dishes.  Don't try\nto get away again until I tell you you can go.  If you do---but\nyou won't,\" finished the cook grimly.\n\nAlf worked away industriously.  At last this outdoor kitchen work\nwas finished.\n\n\"Now I can go, can't I?\" spoke up Alf, hopefully.  \"Say, I'm perishing\nfor want of a smoke.\"\n\n\"Stay and have a man's smoke with me,\" said the cook.  \"Here,\nhold this between your teeth.\"\n\nAlf drew back, half-shuddering from the blackened clay pipe, filled\nwith strong tobacco, which the cook passed him.\n\n\"You're always itching to be a man,\" mocked the cook.  \"And now's\nyour chance.  A pipe is a man's smoke.  Them cigs are fit only\nfor 'sheeters.\"\n\n\"I don't wanter smoke it,\" pleaded Alf, drawing back from the\nproffered pipe.\n\n\"You take matches, light that pipe and smoke it,\" insisted the\ncook, a man named Leon, in a tone that compelled obedience.\n\nPoor Alf smoked wretchedly away.  Finally, when he thought Leon\nwasn't looking, he tried to hide the pipe.\n\n\"Here, you keep that a-going!\" ordered the cook wrathfully, wheeling\nupon the miserable youngster.\n\nSo Alf puffed up, feebly, and, when the pipe went out, he lighted\nthe tobacco again.\n\n\"Here!\" he protested, three minutes later, handing back the pipe.\n\n\"Smoke it!\" gruffed Leon.\n\n\"I---I don't wanter.\"\n\n\"Smoke it!\"\n\n\"I---I can't,\" pleaded Alf Drew, the ghastly pallor of his face\nbearing out his assertion.\n\n\"You smoke that pipe, or I'll-----\"\n\n\"You can kill me, if you wanter,\" gasped, Alf, feeling far more\nill than he had ever felt in his life before.  \"I don't care---but\nI won't smoke that pipe.  There!\"\n\nHe flung it violently to the ground, smashing the pipe.\n\n\"You little-----\" began the cook, making a leap after the youngster.\n\nBut Alf, his sense of self-preservation still being strong, fled\nwith more speed than might have been looked for in one so ill.\n\nTom Reade, passing a clump of bushes, and hearing low moans, stopped\nto investigate.  He found the little cigarette fiend stretched\nout on the ground, his face drawn and pale.\n\n\"What on earth is the matter, mosquito?\" inquired Reade, with\nmore sympathy than his form of speech attested.\n\n\"Oh, dear!\" wailed Alf.\n\n\"So I gathered,\" said Tom dryly.  \"But who got behind you and scared\nyou in that fashion?\"\n\n\"O-o-oh, dear!\"\n\n\"You said that before; but what's up?\"\n\n\"At first I was afraid I was going to die,\" Alf declared tremulously.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"And now I'm afraid I won't die!\"\n\nAlf sat up shivering convulsively.\n\n\"Now, Alf,\" Tom pursued, \"tell me just what happened.\"\n\nBy degrees the young engineer extracted the information that he\nwas after.  Bit by bit Alf told the tale, interspersing his story\nwith dismal groans.\n\n\"I always told you, Alf, that smoking would do you up if you ever\ntackled it,\" Reade said gravely.\n\n\"But I have smoked for a year,\" Alf protested.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" Tom contradicted him.  \"The use of cigarettes isn't\nsmoking.  It's just mere freshness on the part of a small boy.\nBut smoking---that's a different matter, as you've found out.\nNow, Alf, I hope you've learned a needed lesson, and that after\nthis you'll let tobacco alone.  While you're about it you might\nas well quit cigarettes, too.  But I'm going to change your job.\nDon't go back to the cook.  Instead, report to me in about an\nhour.\"\n\nThen Tom strode forward.  After he had left young Drew there was\nan ominous flash in the young engineer's eyes.  He strode into\ncamp and went straight to the cook's shack.\n\n\"Leon,\" Tom demanded, \"what have you been doing to that poor little\nshrimp of a helper?\"\n\nThe cook turned around, grinning.\n\n\"I've been teaching him something about smoking,\" the man admitted.\n\n\"So I've heard,\" said Tom.  \"That's why I've dropped in here---to\ntell you what I think about it.\"\n\n\"If you're going to get cranky,\" warned the cook, angrily, \"you\nneedn't take the trouble.\"\n\n\"Punishing Alf isn't your work, Leon,\" Tom went on quietly.  \"I'm\none of the heads here, and the management of this camp has been\nleft more or less in my hands.  I gave you a weak, deluded, almost\nworthless little piece of humanity as a helper.  I'll admit that\nhe isn't much good, but yet he's a boy aged fourteen, at any rate,\nand therefore there may be in that boy the makings of a man.\nYour way of tackling the job is no good.  It's a fool way, and,\nbesides, it's a brutal, unmanly way.\"\n\n\"I guess you'd better stop, right where you are, Mister Reade!\"\nsnapped Leon, an ugly scowl coming to his face.  \"I don't have\nto take any such talk as that from you, even if you are the boss.\nYou may be the boss here, but I'm older and I've seen more of\nthe world.  So you may pass on your way, Mister Reade, and I'll\nmind my own business while you mind yours.\"\n\n\"Good!\" smiled Tom amiably.  \"That's just the arrangement I've\nbeen trying to get you to pledge yourself to.  Mind your own business,\nafter this, just as you've promised.  Don't play the brute with\nsmall boys.\"\n\n\"You needn't think you can boss me, Mister Reade,\" sneered Leon,\na dangerous look again coming into his eyes.  \"I've told you that\nI won't take that kind of talk from you.\"\n\n\"You'll have to listen to it, just as long as you stay in camp,\"\nReade answered.  \"I don't want to be disagreeable with any man, and\nnever am when I can avoid it.  But there are certain things I won't\nhave done here.  One of them is the bullying of small boys by big\nfellows like you.  Do I make myself plain?\"\n\n\"So plain,\" Leon answered, very quietly, as one hand traveled\nback to the butt of the revolver hanging over his right hip, \"that\nI give you just ten seconds, Mister Reade, to get away and do\nyour talking in another part of the camp.\"\n\nTom saw the motion of the hand toward the weapon, though no change\nin his calm face or steady eyes denoted the fact.\n\n\"I believe I've just one thing more to say to you, Leon.  I've\ntold young Drew that he needn't bother about coming back as your\nhelper.  He is to report to me, and I shall find him another job.\"\n\n\"Are you going to get away from here?\" snarled the angry cook.\n\n\"Presently.\"\n\n\"I'll give you only until I count ten,\" Leon snapped, his hand still\nresting on the butt of his revolver.\n\n\"You're not threatening me with your pistol, are you?\" Tom inquired\nin a mild tone.\n\n\"You'll find out, if you don't vamoose right along.  One---two---\"\n\n\"Stop it,\" Tom commanded, without raising his voice.  \"You may\nthink you could get your pistol out in time to use it.  Try it,\nand you'll learn how quickly I can jump on you and grab you.\nTry to draw your weapon, or even to shift your position ever so\nlittle, and I'll show you a trick that may possibly surprise you.\"\n\nThere was no trace of braggadocio in Tom Reade's quiet voice, but\nLeon knew, instantly, that the young engineer could and would be as\ngood as his word.\n\n\"Take your hand away from the butt of your pistol,\" came Tom's\nnext command.\n\nSomething in the look of the young engineer's eyes compelled the\nangry cook to obey.\n\n\"Now, unbuckle your belt and hand it to me, revolver and all.\"\n\n\"I'll-----\" Leon flared up, but Tom interrupted him.\n\n\"Exactly, my friend.  You'll be very wise if you do, and very\nsorry if you don't!\"\n\nWhite with rage Leon unbuckled his belt.  Then he handed it out,\nslowly.  He was prepared to leap upon the young engineer like\na panther, but Tom was watching alertly.  He received the belt\nwith his left hand, holding his right hand clenched ready for\n\"business.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Tom quietly.  \"Now, you may return to your work.\nI'm ready to forget this, Leon, if you are.\"\n\nLeon glared speechlessly at his conqueror.  This cook had lived\nin some of the roughest of mining camps, and had the reputation\nof being dangerous when angry.\n\nFrom outside came an appreciative chuckle.  Then Jim Ferrers stepped\ninto the shack.\n\n\"So you were hanging about, ready to back up the kid?\" demanded\nthe cook.\n\n\"I?  Oh, no,\" chuckled Jim.  \"Leon, when you've known Mr. Reade\nas long and as well as I do you'll understand that he doesn't ask\nor need any backing.  Mr. Reade wants only what's right---but he's\ngoing to have it if he has to move a township.\"\n\nTom departed, swinging the belt and revolver from his right hand.\n\n\"I'm through here,\" muttered Leon, snatching off his apron.  \"That\nis, just as soon as I've squared up accounts with that kid.\"\n\n\"Then you'd better put your apron on again,\" Jim drawled, humorously.\n\"It takes longer than you've got left to live when any one goes\nafter Tom Reade to get even.\"\n\n\"Jim Ferrers, you know me well enough,\" remarked Leon, reaching for\nhis hat.  \"Most times I'm peaceable, but when I get started I'm a\nbad man.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" nodded Jim undisturbed.  \"That's why you can never\nhope to come out on top in a row with Mr. Reade.  While you may\nbe a bad man, he's a good man---and ALL MAN!  You don't stand\nany show with that kind.  Hang up your hat, Leon.  Here's your\napron.  Put it on and stay with us.  When you cool down you can\nstay right along here and take lessons in the art of being a real\nman!\"\n\nJim Ferrers strolled out of the shack, leaving the vanquished\ncook in a towering rage.  By degrees the expression on the fellow's\nface altered.  Ten minutes later he was at work---at cook's duties.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nWHY READE WANTED GOLD\n\n\nFour weeks moved on rapidly.  All too rapidly, in some respects,\nto please Engineer Harry Hazelton.\n\nSheriff's officers had ridden into camp, and had scoured that\npart of the country, in an effort to locate Dolph Gage and that\nworthy's friends.  Just where the four vagabonds were now no man\nknew, save themselves.\n\nHowever, another spectre had settled down over the camp.  The\ntruth was that the young engineers were now using up the last\nthousand dollars of their combined savings.\n\nBy way of income, less than fifty dollars' worth of gold and silver\nhad been mined.  Every few days some promising-looking ore was\nturned out, but it never came in sufficient quantities.  None\nof this ore had yet been moved toward Dugout City.  There wasn't\nenough of it to insure good results.  Brilliant in streaks, still\nthe mine looked like a commercial fizzle.\n\n\"Hang it, the gold is down there!\" grunted Tom, staring gloomily\nat the big cut that had been blasted and dug out along the top\nof the ridge.\n\n\"I'll be tremendously happy when you show me a little more of it,\"\nsmiled Hazelton weakly.\n\n\"It's lower down,\" argued Tom.  \"We've got to dig deeper---and then\na lot deeper.\"\n\n\"On the capital that we have left?\" ventured Harry.\n\n\"Oh, we may strike enough, any day, to stake us for a few weeks\nlonger,\" urged Tom.\n\n\"We'll soon have to be working in covered outs, where the frost\nwon't put up trouble for us, you know,\" Hazelton hinted.\n\n\"Yes; I know that, of course.  What we must begin to do, soon, is to\nsink the shaft deeper and then tunnel.\"\n\n\"That will cost a few thousand dollars, Tom.\"\n\n\"I know it.  Come on, Harry.  Get a shovel.\"\n\nTom himself snatched up a pick.\n\n\"What are you going to do, Tom?\"\n\n\"Work.  You and I are strong and enduring.  We can save the wages of\ntwo workmen.\"\n\nBoth young engineers worked furiously that afternoon.  Yet, when\nknocking-off time came, they had to admit that they had no better\nbasis for hope.\n\n\"I wonder, Tom, if we'd better get out and hustle for Jobs?\" Harry\nasked.\n\n\"You might, Harry.  I'm going to stick.\"\n\nMr. Dunlop dropped in at camp, that evening, after dark.\n\n\"You young men are doing nothing,\" said the mine promoter.  \"I\ncan use you a couple of months, if you'll stop this foolishness\nhere and come over to me.\"\n\n\"Why, I suppose Hazelton could go over and work for you, Mr. Dunlop,\"\nTom suggested.\n\n\"That would be of no use.  I need you both, but you, Reade, most\nof all.\"\n\n\"I can't go to you now, Mr. Dunlop,\" Tom replied regretfully. \"I'm\ncommitted to the development of this piece of property, which is\nonly a third my property.\"\n\n\"Bosh!  A decent farm would be worth more to you than this claim,\"\nargued Mr. Dunlop derisively.\n\n\"Perhaps.  But neither of my partners has quit, Mr. Dunlop, and I'm\nnot going to quit, either.\"\n\n\"This is the last chance I can give you, Reade.  You'd better take it.\"\n\n\"No; though I beg you to accept my best thanks, Mr. Dunlop.  However,\nHazelton can go over and help you.\"\n\n\"Both, or neither,\" returned Mr. Dunlop firmly.\n\nHarry looked half eagerly at Reade, but Tom shook his head.\n\n\"What do you say, Mr. Reade?\" pressed the promoter.  \"Last call\nto the dining car.  With your funds running low, and a hard winter\ncoming on you'll soon know what it means to be hungry.\"\n\n\"I'm much obliged, sir but I'm going to stick here at my own work.\"\n\n\"What do you say, Hazelton?\" coaxed the promoter.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Harry replied loyally.  \"You heard what my partner had\nto say.  In business matters he talks for both of us.\"\n\n\"Good night, then,\" grunted Mr. Dunlop, rising.  \"If you should\nchange your minds in the morning, after breakfast, come and tell me.\"\n\nAfter Dunlop had gone Tom and Harry walked up and down the trail\ntogether under the stars.\n\n\"Sixteen hundred dollars a month Dunlop is offering the two of\nus,\" half sighed Hazelton.  \"Two months of that would mean thirty-two\nhundred dollars.  How much money have we now, Tom?\"\n\n\"Six hundred and forty-two dollars and nineteen cents,\" Reade\nanswered dryly.\n\n\"That won't last us long, will it?\"\n\n\"No; especially as we owe some of it on bills soon due at Dugout.\"\n\n\"Then---what?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Tom answered almost fiercely.  \"Yes; I do know!\nAs soon as our present few pennies are gone it means a future of\nfight and toil, on empty stomachs.  But it's worth it, Harry---if\nwe live through the ordeal.\"\n\n\"And for what are we fighting?\" inquired Harry musingly.\n\n\"First of all, then, for gold.\"\n\n\"Tom, I never knew you to be so crazy about gold before.  What\nare we going to do with it---if we get it?\"\n\n\"There are the folks at home.\"\n\n\"Of course, Tom, and they would be our first thought---if we had\nthe gold.  But we can do all we want to for the home folks out\nof the pay that we are able to earn at steady jobs.\"\n\n\"True.\"\n\n\"Then why are we fooling around here?  We are nearly broke, but\nwe can honestly settle all the debts we owe.  Then we could get\nback to work and have bank accounts again within a few months.\"\n\n\"Yes; but only pitiful bank accounts---a few hundreds of dollars,\nor a few thousands.\"\n\nIt would be steady and growing.\"\n\n\"Yes; but it would take years to pile up a fortune, Harry.\"\n\n\"What do we really want with fortunes?\"\n\n\"We want them, Harry,\" Tom went on, almost passionately, \"because\nwe have ambitions.  Look out upon the great mountains of this\nRange.  Think of the rugged bits of Nature in any part of the\nworld, waiting for the conquering hand and the constructive brain\nof the engineer!  Harry, don't you long to do some of the big\nthings that are done by engineers?  Don't you want to get into\nthe real---the big performances of our profession?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" nodded Hazelton.  \"For that reason, aren't we doubly\nwasting our time here?\"\n\n\"That's just as it turns out,\" Reade went on, with a vehemence\nthat astonished his chum.  \"Harry, what's our office address?\nWhere are our assistant engineers---where our draftsmen?  Where\nare our foremen that we could summon to great undertakings?  Where\nis the costly equipment that we would need as a firm of really\ngreat engineers?  You know that we must these things before we\ncan climb to the top of our profession.  The gold that's hidden\nsomewhere under that ridge would give us the offices, the assistants,\nthe draftsmen, the equipment and the bank account that we need\nbefore we can launch ourselves into first class engineering feats\nof the great civilization that rules the world today.  Harry,\nI've firm faith in our claim, and I can go on working on a meal\nevery third day.\"\n\n\"Then now, as always, you can count on me to stand by you without\nlimit or complaint,\" said Harry generously.\n\n\"But, just the same, you haven't my faith in the mine, have you?\"\nTom queried half-disappointedly.\n\n\"Er---er---\"\n\n\"Out with it, chum!\"\n\n\"So far I have been disappointed in the claim.  But I am well\naware that I may be wrong.  Listen, Tom, old fellow.  This isn't\na matter of faith in the mine; it's one of faith in you.  Go as\nfar as you like, and, whichever way it turns out, remember that\nI regard your judgment as being many times as good as my own.\"\n\n\"Yet you'd drop out if the decision rested solely with you, wouldn't\nyou, Harry,\"\n\n\"You'll never again get my opinion of this claim of ours,\" laughed\nHazelton.  \"You'll have to be contented with my good opinion of\nyou and your judgment.\"\n\n\"But see here, Harry, I wish you'd get out of here for a while.\nGo back into the world; take a position that will support you\nand provide the luxuries and savings as well.  I'll work here\nfaithfully and work for both of us at the same time.\"\n\n\"You must have a mighty small opinion of me, Tom Reade, to think\nI'd leave you in the lurch like that.\"\n\n\"But I ask it as a favor, Harry.\"\n\n\"If you ever ask that sort of a favor again, Tom Reade, you and\nI will be nearer to fighting than we've ever been yet in our lives!\"\n\nIt was plain that Hazelton intended to stick to the mine, even\nto the starving point, if Reade did.  After some further talk\nthe two went back to their tent and lay down on their cots.\n\nFive minutes later Harry's quiet, regular breathing betrayed the\nfact that he was asleep.  With a stealthy movement, Tom Reade\nthrew down the blankets, reached for his shoes, his coat and hat\nand stole out into the quiet and darkness.\n\nFrom other tents and shacks nearby came snores that showed how\nsoundly miners could sleep.\n\n\"I believe this is the first night that I ever failed to sleep\non account of business worries,\" muttered Reade grimly, as he\nstrode away.  \"This may be a fine start toward becoming a nervous\nwreck.  In time I may become as shattered as poor little Alf Drew.\nI wonder if I shall ever fall so low as to smoke cigarettes!\"\n\nFor some minutes Tom plodded on through the darkness.  He did\nnot go toward the claim, but in the opposite direction.  He walked\nlike one who felt the need of physical exhaustion.  Presently\ncoming to a steep trail winding along among boulders he took to\nthe trail, striding on at barely diminished speed.\n\nAt last, out of breath from the rapid climb, Tom halted and gazed\ndown over the rugged landscape.  \"The gold is there,\" he muttered.\n\"I'm sure of it.  Oh, if we could only find it!\"\n\nAs Tom stood, deep in thought, the face of his patient friend\nrose before him.\n\n\"I don't mind going to smash for myself, in a good, hard fight,\"\nReade went on audibly.  \"But it seems a crime to drag Harry down\nto poverty with me.  If I could only get him to go away I'd give\nup my own life, if need be, to prove what's under our ridge of\nNevada dirt.\"\n\n\"Ye'll give up your life for less'n that, I reckon!\" sounded\nanother voice, close at hand.\n\nAround a boulder Dolph Gage stepped into view, followed by two of\nhis men.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE MAN WHO MADE GOOD\n\n\n\"Good evening, Gage,\" Tom responded pleasantly, after a slight\nstart of alarm.  \"What brings you in this section again?\"\n\n\"Wanter know?\" sneered Gage, while his companions scowled.\n\n\"That was my object in inquiring,\" Tom smiled.\n\n\"We're hiding---that's what we're doing here,\" Gage volunteered\nharshly, though he spoke in a low voice.\n\n\"Hiding here---with the officers looking for you?\"\n\n\"Well, what could be a safer place than right where we're wanted?\"\ndemanded Dolph.  \"The officers are scouring other counties for\nus, and they have handbills up offering rewards for us.  Right\nhere, overlooking your claim, they'd never think of looking for\nmen who have a price set on their capture.\"\n\n\"Well, you needn't be afraid of me,\" offered Reade, with mock\ngenerosity.  \"I'm short of money, but I'm not looking for blood\nmoney.  You had better travel fast from here.  I'll give you until\ndaylight before I send word to the law's officers.\"\n\n\"Daylight?  You'll never see daylight again,\" Gage retorted.\n\"You will be lying here, looking up at the stars, but you won't\nsee anything!\"\n\n\"Your words have a mysterious ring to them,\" laughed Tom.\n\nHe wasn't in any doubt as to what the rascals meant to do with\nhim.  It was a rule with Tom Reade, however, that he wasn't dead\nuntil he had actually been killed.  Even while he spoke so lightly,\nTom, through his half-closed eyes, was taking in every detail\nof the situation.\n\nNone of the trio had yet drawn their weapons, though all wore\nthem in plain sight.  If they started to draw their pistols Tom\ndecided that he would leap forward holding to Gage, kicking one\nof the latter's companions so as to render the fellow helpless,\nand----\n\n\"But the third man will get me with his pistol,\" Tom decided.\n\"That is, unless they become flustered when I show fight.  It's\na slim chance for me---a mighty slim chance, but I'll do my best\nas soon as these wretches start something!\"\n\n\"Lost your money in your claim, haven't you?\" jeered Gage, who\nwas plainly playing with his intended victim.  \"Serves you right,\nafter jumping us out of the property just because the law said\nyou could!  But the gold's there, and we've got a man with mineral\nrights to nab the claim as soon as you give up.\"\n\n\"That will be a long while, I imagine,\" Tom smiled back at the rascal.\n\n\"Not as long as you may think,\" laughed Gage harshly.  \"We've\ngot you now, and we'll get Hazelton and Jim Ferrers, next thing\nyou know.  Then our claim will be established through our friend,\nand we'll protect him from being jumped by any one else.\"\n\n\"If you live,\" Tom reminded the fellow.\n\n\"Oh, we'll live!\" Gage retorted grimly.  \"We're hunted, now, and\nwe'll kill every man that comes near enough.\"\n\n\"Begin with this cub!\" spoke up Eb, gruffly.  \"Don't play with\nhim until he tricks us and gets away.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you don't realize how close help is to me,\" Tom broke in\nquickly.  It was a \"bluff,\" but he hoped that it might have its\neffect.\n\n\"If there's help near you,\" quivered Gage, his anger rising, \"we'll\nmake sure that it doesn't get here in time to do you any good.\nDraw and finish him boys!\"\n\nBefore Reade could tense his muscles for a spring, a shot rang\nout behind them.  Eb fell, with a swift, smothered groan of pain.\n\n\"Duck!\" panted Dolph Gage.  \"Out of this!  To cover, and then\nwe'll reckon with any one who tries to follow us!\"\n\nIn the same instant Tom turned, bounding down the trail in the\ndirection from which the shot had come.\n\n\"Good!  Keep on going, boss!\" whispered a calm voice.  \"Don't\nlet 'em catch you again.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" Tom demanded, halting and trying to make out the\nman's face in the intense shadow under a ledge of rock.\n\n\"Duck!\" commanded the same voice.  \"I'll follow close.  I'm alone,\nand some of that crew may pluck up heart and follow us.  Vamoose!\"\n\n\"I'll go at your side, but I won't run ahead of you,\" Tom whispered\nback.  \"I know you, now.  Thank you, Leon!\"\n\nIn the darkness, in lieu of shaking hands Tom gripped one of the\nman's elbows in sign of thanks.\n\n\"We'd better get out of this,\" Tom went on, in a barely louder whisper.\n\"But how did you come to be on hand, Leon?\"\n\n\"Followed you,\" was the terse reply.\n\n\"From the camp?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Wanted to get even with you.\"\n\n\"You're talking in riddles,\" Reade protested, in a puzzled tone.\n\"At the same time I'm greatly obliged to you.\"\n\n\"Thought you'd be,\" grunted Leon.  \"That's how I got even.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Tom wanted to know.  \"You got even by placing\nme under a great obligation?\"\n\n\"Just that,\" nodded the cook, \"we had trouble, once, and you\ncame out on top, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Yes; but that little affair needn't have prevented us from being\nfriends.\"\n\n\"It did, until I had done something to make you needed me as a\nfriend,\" the cook declared.\n\nTom laughed at this statement of the case.  It accorded quite closely,\nhowever, with the cook's generally sulky disposition.  Even a\nfriendship Leon would offer or accept grudgingly.\n\n\"But why did you follow me?\" Tom continued, as they neared the camp.\n\"Did you think I was going to run into danger?\"\n\nLeon hesitated.\n\n\"Well,\" he admitted, finally, \"when I saw you stealing off, soft\nlike, I had a queer notion come over me that, maybe, you were\ndiscouraged, and that you were going off to put an end to yourself.\"\n\nTom started, stared in amazement, then spoke in a tone of pretended\nanger:\n\n\"Much obliged for your fine opinion of me, Leon,\" he declared.\n\"Only cowards and lunatics commit suicide.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" nodded the cook doggedly.  \"I've seen men\nlose their minds out here in these gold fields.\"\n\nThey were now in camp.\n\n\"Wait, and I'll call Ferrers and a few of the men, Leon,\" Tom\nproposed.\n\n\"What for?  To stand guard?\"\n\n\"No; we must send back a few of the men to find that man you wounded.\nIt was Eb.  He fell in a heap.  If his own companions didn't\ncarry him away he was left in a bad fix.\"\n\n\"You'll be going back to nurse rattlesnakes yet!\" almost exploded\nthe cook.\n\n\"That's all right, but we're going to find that wounded man if\nhe's in need of help,\" Tom stoutly maintained.\n\nHe called Jim Ferrers, who roused five more men.  Then the party\nreturned to the place on the trail where Eb had been left.  There\nwere still blood spots on the ground, but Eb had vanished.  The\nparty spent some minutes in searching the vicinity, then concluded\nthat Gage had rescued and carried away the wounded man.\n\nIt may be said, in passing, that Eb was subsequently found, by\nofficers, lying in a shack not far from Dugout City.  The fellow\nwas nearly dead, when found, from careless handling of his wound.\nAt Dugout the surgeons amputated his wounded leg, and Eb finally\nwound up in prison.\n\nDuring all the excitement Hazelton had not been aroused.  He knew\nnothing of what had happened until morning came.\n\nBefore Tom Reade turned in that night he shook hands with the\nsullen cook.\n\n\"I think you and I are going to be good friends, after this, Leon,\"\nTom smiled.  \"I hope so, anyway.\"\n\n\"And I'm glad you gave me back my gun,\" grunted Leon.  \"It gave\nme a chance to do something for you.  Yes; I reckon we'll be good\nfriends after this.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nTHE MINERS WHO \"STUCK\"\n\n\n\"Hey, Tom!\" Harry called down, from the top of their shaft, now\none hundred and thirty feet down into the ground.\n\n\"Yes!\" Reade answered from below, making a trumpet of his hands.\n\n\"Doing anything?\" Harry bawled.\n\n\"Not much.  Why?\"\n\n\"If you want to come up I'll show you something.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The first snow of winter is falling.\" Harry tried to speak jovially,\nbut his tone was almost sepulchral.\n\n\"Yes, I'll come up, then,\" Tom Reade answered.  \"It's high time\nfor us to see to building a shelter that will keep out of the\nshaft the big snows that are coming.\"\n\n\"The big snows are likely to be here, now, within a week,\" remarked\none of the miners who had paused to rest from digging for a moment.\n\"Men!\" bawled Tom, stepping from the long into the short tunnel.\n\"All hands knock off and go up to the surface.\"\n\nThere was a tub hand-hoist for carrying up ore, but the men always\nused the series of ladders that had been built in on the side\nof the shaft.  Two minutes later these ladders swarmed with men\ngoing above.\n\nAs they stepped out into the world the first soft flakes of winter\nfloated into their faces.\n\n\"Reade, we'll have to start building the cover to the shaft,\" spoke\nJim Ferrers, who stood beside Hamilton.\n\n\"I know it,\" Tom nodded.  \"However, first of all, I want a few words\nwith you and Harry.\"\n\nThe three partners stepped aside, waiting in silence while a whispered\nconsultation went on around Tom.\n\nAt length Reade stepped back.\n\n\"Men\" he began, and every eye was turned in his direction.  \"You\nare waiting for orders to start on shedding over the shaft, and the\nlumber is ready.  However, we mean to be fair with you.  You all\nknow that this claim has been going badly.  When my partners and I\nstarted we had some capital.  Before we do any more work here it\nis only fair to tell you something.  We now have money enough left\nso that we can pay you your wages up to Saturday.  When we've paid\nthat we shall have a few dollars left.  If you men want to quit\nnow we'll pay you up to Saturday, and you'll have time to be in\nDugout before your time here is up.\"\n\n\"Do you want us to go, Mr. Reade?\" asked Tim Walsh.\"\n\n\"Why, no, of course not,\" Tom smiled.  \"If we had the money we'd\nwant to keep you here all winter.  But we haven't, and so we've no\nright to ask you to stay.\"\n\nWalsh glanced around him, as though to inquire whether the men were\nwilling that he be their spokesman.  Receiving their nods the big\nminer went on:\n\n\"Mr. Reade, sir, we've seen this coming, though, of course, we\ndidn't know just how big your pile was.  We've talked it over\nsome, and I know what the fellows think.  If you don't pay us\nour wages, but put the money into grub only, you can keep a-going\nhere some weeks yet.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Tom nodded.  \"But in that case, if the mine didn't pan out,\nwe wouldn't have a cent left out of which to pay you off.  At least,\nnot until Reade and I had been at work for months, perhaps a year,\non some salaried job.  So you see that we can't fairly encourage you\nmen to remain here.\"\n\n\"Mr. Reade,\" Walsh declared, this time without glancing at the\nother men, and there was a slight huskiness in the big miner's\nvoice, \"we wouldn't feel right if we went anywhere else to work.\nWe've never worked under men as fair and square as you three\nmen have been.  You've treated all of us white.  Now, what kind\nof fellows would we be if we cleared out and left you just because\nthe snow had come and the money had gone.  No, sir!  By your leave,\ngentlemen, we'll stay here as long as you do, and the money can\ntake care of itself until it shows up again.  Mr. Reade, and gentlemen,\nwe stick as long as you'll let us!\"\n\nTom felt slightly staggered, as his face showed it.\n\n\"Men,\" he protested, \"this is magnificent on your part.  But it\nwouldn't be fair to let you do it.  You are all of you working for\nyour living.\"\n\n\"Well, aren't you three working for your living, too?\" grinned Walsh.\n\n\"Yes; but we stand to make the big stake here, in case of victory\nat last.\"\n\n\"And I reckon we stand a show of having a little extra coming to\nus, if we do right by you at this minute,\" laughed Walsh.\n\n\"Yes, you do---if we strike the rich vein for which we're hunting.\nYet have you men any idea a how little chance we may have of\nstriking that vein?  Men, the mine may---perhaps I would better\nsay probably will---turn out a fizzle.  I am afraid you men are\nvoting for some weeks of wasted work and a hungry tramp back to\nDugout City at the end.  As much as we want to go on with the work,\nwe hate to see you all stand to lose so much.\"\n\n\"You're no fool, Mr. Reade.  Neither is Mr. Hazelton,\" returned\nWalsh bluntly.  \"You're both engineers, and not green ones, either.\nYou've been studying mines and mining, and it isn't just guess-work\nwith you when you say that you feel sure of striking rich ore.\"\n\n\"Only one of us is sure,\" smiled Tom Reade wistfully.  \"I'm the\nsure one.  As for my partners, I'm certain that they're sticking\nto me just because they're too loyal to desert a partner.  For\nmyself, I wouldn't blame them if they left me any day.  As for\nyou men, I shall be glad to have you stay and stand by us, now\nthat you know the state of affairs, but I won't blame you if you\ndecide to take your money and the path back to Dugout City.\"\n\n\"It's no use, Mr. Reade,\" laughed Walsh, shaking his shaggy head.\n\"You couldn't persuade one of us to leave you now.\"\n\n\"And I'd thrash any man who tried to,\" declared another miner.\n\n\"Men, I thank you,\" Tom declared, his eyes shining, \"and I hope\nthat we shall all win out together.\"\n\n\"Now, what do you want us to do?\" asked Walsh.\n\n\"We have timbers and boards here,\" Tom replied.  \"If the big snows\nare likely to be upon us within a week, then we can't lose any time\nin getting our shaft protected.  At the same time we must use other\ntimber for putting up two or three more shacks.  The tents will\nhave to come down until spring.\"\n\nHarry immediately took eight of the men and started the erection\nof three wooden shacks not far from the mine shaft.  Ferrers took\nthe rest of the men and speedily had timbers going up in place\nover the mouth of the shaft.\n\nFor three hours the snow continued to float lightly down.  Then\nthe skies cleared, but the wind came colder and more biting.\n\nJim Ferrers and one of the men started for Dugout City with a\ntwo-horse wagon, that the camp might be kept well-supplied with\nfood.\n\nBy night of the day following all of the carpenter work had been\nfinished, though not an hour too soon, for now the weather was\nbecoming colder.\n\n\"Never put in a winter on the Indian Smoke Range, did you, Mr.\nReade?\" Walsh inquired.\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Then you'll find out what cold weather is like.  A winter on\nthis Range isn't much worse, though, than what I've heard about\ncold weather in Alaska.\"\n\n\"It'll be a relief to see six feet of snow, after living on the\nhot desert of Arizona,\" Harry muttered.\n\nBy evening of the following day, when Jim and his companion returned\nwith the wagon-load of provisions, another day's work had been\ndone in the mine.\n\n\"Any color today?\" was Ferrers's first question.\n\n\"No signs of gold,\" sighed Harry.\n\n\"I heard a new one over at Dugout City,\" Jim remarked carelessly.\n\n\"Heard a new one?\" echoed Tom.  \"What was it?\"\n\n\"A baby,\" Jim answered dryly.\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" Harry demanded.  \"What has a baby\nto do with a 'new one'?\"\n\nWhen the men began to laugh Harry suddenly discovered the joke.\n\n\"That's all right, Jim,\" growled Harry.  \"But I know something\nthat would tickle you.\"\n\n\"A feather, or a straw,\" mocked Ferrers.\n\n\"No!  A crowbar!\" grunted Hazelton making a reach for a tool of\nthat description.\n\nJim hastily jumped out of the way as Harry balanced the bar.\n\n\"Go and tell the men about the 'new one' you heard, Jim,\" laughed\nTom.  \"By the time you get back Harry will have the joke pried loose\nwith that bar of his.\"\n\n\"'Heard a new one'!\" grunted Harry.  But his look of disgust was\nbecause it had taken him so long to penetrate the \"sell.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nTHE GODDESS OF FORTUNE SMILES WISTFULLY\n\n\n\"Haul away!\" called Jim, from the bottom of the shaft.\n\nUp came the tub, filled with chunks of ore, each about the size\nof a man's head.\n\nAt the top stood Harry Hazelton, on the crust of two feet of frozen\nsnow.\n\nTom thrust his head out through the doorway of the nearby shack\nin which the partners lived.\n\n\"Is Jim sending up any bricks\" he inquired.\n\n\"He's sending up ore, but I don't know whether it's any good,\"\nHarry answered.\n\n\"Why don't you look the stuff over?\"\n\n\"I haven't had the heart to look at it.\"\n\nClose to the shaft stood a wagon.  The horses were resting in\nthe stable shack, for by this time the weather averaged only a\nfew degrees above zero and the horses were brought out only when\nthey could be used.\n\n\"Take a good look at the stuff, Harry,\" called Tom, as soon as\nhe saw two of the workmen dumping it.\n\nThen Reade closed the door, and went back to the furnace that\nhe had rigged up under the chimney at one end of the shack.\n\n\"Oh, what's the use?\" sighed Hazelton, to himself, as he paused,\nirresolute.  \"In weeks and weeks we haven't brought up enough\ngold to pay for the keep of the horses.\"\n\nStill, as Tom had asked him to do so, Hazelton presently walked\nover to the little pile that had just been dumped.\n\n\"You men up there work faster,\" sounded Jim's voice.  \"We want\nto send up a tub every five minutes.\"\n\n\"Want the team yet?\" bawled the teamster, from another shack.\n\n\"No,\" Harry answered.  \"Not for a half an hour yet.\"\n\nThat question was enough to cause the young engineer to forget\nthat he had intended to inspect the tub-load of ore.  He strolled\nback to the head of the shaft.  The wind was biting keenly today.\nHarry was dressed in the warmest clothing he had, yet his feet\nfelt like lumps of lead in his shoes.\n\n\"Arizona may be hot, but I'd rather do my mining down there, anyway,\"\nthought the young engineer.  \"If I could move about more, this\nwouldn't be so bad.\"\n\nJust off of the shaft was a rough shack several feet square which\ncontained a small cylinder of a wood stove.  There was a fire\ngoing in the stove, now, but Harry knew from experience that if\nhe went in to the stove to get warm, he would only feel the cold\nmore severely when he came out again.\n\n\"Say, I don't know why I couldn't run that furnace as well as\nTom, and he likes this cold stuff better than I do,\" murmured\nHazelton.  \"I am going to see if he won't swap jobs for a couple\nof hours.\"\n\n\"Getting anything out of those ore-tests of yesterday's dump?\"\nHarry demanded, entering their shack.\n\n\"Not so much,\" Tom replied cheerily.  \"We're in a bad streak of\nstuff, Harry.  But I thought you were watching the dump.  What's\nthe matter?  Too cold out there?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" nodded Harry.  \"I feel like a last year's cold storage\negg.  Don't you want to spell me a bit out there, Tom?  I can\nrun the furnace in here.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Reade agreed, leaping up.  \"There's nothing to do,\nnow, but weigh the button when it cools.\"\n\n\"Did you really get a button?\" Harry asked, casually, as he drew\noff his heavy overcoat.\n\n\"Yes; a small one.\"\n\n\"How much ore did you take it from?\"\n\n\"About two tons, I should say.\"\n\n\"Then, if the button is worth sixty cents,\" mocked Harry, \"it\nwill show that our ore is running thirty cents to the ton.\"\n\n\"Oh, we'll have better ore, after a while,\" Tom laughed.\n\n\"We've got to have,\" grunted Hazelton, \"or else we'll have to\nwalk all the way to our next job.\"\n\n\"Just weigh the button, when it cools, and enter the weight on\nthis page of the notebook,\" directed Reade, then went for his\nown outdoor clothing.  \"Have you been inspecting the dump as the\nstuff came up?\"\n\n\"You'll think me a fool,\" cried Harry, \"but I totally forgot it.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" Tom answered cheerily.  \"I've been doing bench work\nso long in here that I need exercise.  I can run over all the\nstuff.\"\n\nAfter Reade had pulled on his overcoat and buttoned it he fastened\na belt around his waist.  Through this he thrust a geologist's\nhammer.\n\n\"Don't go to sleep, Harry, old fellow, until you've cooled and\nweighed the button.  Then you may just as well take a nap as not.\"\n\n\"There he goes,\" muttered Hazelton, as the door closed briskly.\n\"Faith and enthusiasm are keeping Tom up.  He could work twenty-four\nhours and never feel it.  I wish I had some of his faith in this\nridge.  I could work better for it.  Humph!  I'm afraid the ridge\nwill never yield anything better than clay for brick-making!\"\n\nHarry did succeed in keeping his eyes open long enough to attend\nto the button.  That tiny object weighed, and the weight entered,\nHazelton sat back in his chair.  Within a minute his eyes had\nclosed and he was asleep.\n\nTom Reade, out at the ore dump, looked anything but sleepy.  With\ntireless energy he turned over the pieces of rock, pausing, now\nand then, to hold up one for inspection.\n\nIn reaching for a new piece his foot slipped.  Glancing down,\nto see just where the object was on which he had slipped, Tom\nsuddenly became so interested that he dropped down on his knees\nin the snow.\n\nIt was a piece of rock that had come up in the first tubful.\nAt one point on the piece of rock there was a small, dull yellow\nglow.\n\nReads pawed the rock over in eager haste.  Then he drew the hammer\nfrom his belt, striking the rock sharply.  Piece after piece fell\naway until a solid yellow mass, streaked here and there faintly\nwith quartz, lay in his hand.\n\n\"By the great Custer!\" quivered Tom.\n\n\"What's the matter, boss?\" called one of the workmen.  \"Got a sliver\nin your hand?\"\n\n\"Have I?\" retorted Tom joyously.  \"Come here and take a look.\"\n\n\"Haul away!\" sounded Ferrers's hoarse voice from below.\n\n\"Tell Jim to stop sending and come up a minute,\" nodded Tom.\n\n\"Do you often see a finer lump than this?\"  Tom wanted to know\nas the two workmen came to him.  He held up a nugget.  Shaped\nsomewhat like a horn-of-plenty, it weighed in the neighborhood\nof three ounces.\n\n\"Say, if there are many more like that down at the foot of the\nshaft this old hole-in-the-ridge will be a producer before another\nweek is out!\" answered one of the workmen.  \"How much is it worth,\nboss?\"\n\n\"Allowing for the quartz that streaks this little gold-piece,\nit ought to be worth from forty to fifty dollars,\" Tom responded\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"Fifty dollars?\" broke in Jim Ferrers, as he sprang from the top\nladder to the ground.  \"Is there that much money on the Indian\nSmoke?\"\n\n\"Not minted, of course,\" laughed Tom.  \"But here's something as\ngood as money.\"\n\n\"Where did you get it?\" Jim demanded, tersely, after one look\nat the nugget.\n\n\"In this ore-dump.\"\n\n\"Today's send-up, then?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nWithout a word Ferrers fell at work on the pile of rocks, turning\nthem over fast.\n\nTom helped him.  The two men, released from hoisting duty, also\naided.\n\n\"Nothing more like that sticking out of the rock,\" Jim grunted,\nturning to one of the men.  \"Bring me a sledge.\"\n\nWith that larger hammer, held in both hands, Jim placed ore pieces\nwith his feet, swiftly bringing down sharp blows that reduced\nthe rocks to nearly the size of pebbles.\n\n\"I don't see any more nuggets coming,\" mused!  Tom.  \"But wait\na minute.  Look at the yellow streak through some of these fragments.\"\n\"We're getting into the vein, I believe,\" spoke Jim solemnly.\n\"Look at the stuff!  But wait!  I've a little more hammering to do.\"\n\nBack of them stood the teamster, who had just come up with the horses.\n\n\"Am I to take that stuff and dump it down the ravine?\" he asked\nslowly.\n\n\"If you do,\" retorted Ferrers heatedly, \"I'll hammer in the top\nof your head, Andy!  Reade, won't you pick out what you want for\nthe site of the ore-dump.  We've got some real ore at last!\"\nOne of the two hoist-men now ran to the shaft, shouting down the\ngreat news.\n\n\"Hold on there, Bill,\" Tom called dryly.  \"Don't get the boys excited\nover what may turn out to be nothing.  Don't tell 'em any more than\nthat we have-----\"\n\n\"Tell 'em yourself, boss,\" retorted Bill.  \"Here they come!\"\n\nFrom the ladder a steady stream of men discharged itself until the\nlast one was up.\n\n\"Where are you going, Tim?\" called Tom, turning just in time to\nnote big Walsh's movements.\n\n\"Going to call Mr. Hazelton, sir.\"\n\n\"Don't do it.  Don't get him stirred up for nothing.\"\n\n\"For nothing, boss?\"\n\n\"Don't bother Hazelton until we can tell him something more definite.\nBoys, with all my heart I hope that we have something as good\nas we appear to have.  But every man of you knows that, once in\na while, gold is found abundantly in a few hundred pounds of rock,\nand then, from that point on, no more yellow is found.  We won't\nget excited until we get our first thousand dollars' worth out\nof the ground and have the smelter's check in hand.  We'll hope---and\npray---but we won't cheer just yet.\"\n\n\"Humph!  If you don't want us to cheer, then what shall we do?\"\ndemanded big Walsh.\n\n\"We'll work!\" Tom retorted energetically.  \"We'll work as we never\ndid before.  We'll keep things moving every minute of the time.\nBack with you into the shaft and out into the tunnel!  You hoist-men\nstand by for a big performance with the tub.  Jennison, you may\nstay up from below and tote specimens for me.  I shall be at the\nfurnace until midnight at the least.\"\n\n\"I'll tote for you till daylight, if the good streak only holds\nout,\" laughed Jennison, with glowing eyes.\n\n\"Come softly into the shack when you do come,\" Tom directed.\n\"I'm going to put Mr. Hazelton to bed, and I don't want any one\nto wake him.  When I play out tonight he'll have to be fresh enough\nto take my place at the assay bench and furnace.\"\n\nSoftly Tom entered their shack.\n\nHarry lay fast asleep, breathing heavily.\n\n\"This won't do, old fellow,\" spoke Tom gently, shaking his chum's\nshoulder.  \"No; don't wake up.  Just get into bed.  I may want\nto turn in later, and, when I do, I may have some work left over\nthat I'll want you to do.\"\n\n\"Anything up?\" asked Harry drowsily.\n\n\"I'm going to be busy for a while, and then I want you to be,\"\nTom answered.\n\nHe half pushed his chum toward the narrow bunk against the wall.\nDrowsy Hazelton needed no urging, but stretched himself out in\nhis bunk.\n\nTom drew the blankets up over him, adding:\n\n\"Don't stir until I call you.\"\n\nHour after hour the men below in the mine sent up tub-lots of\nrock.  Jim spent half of his time above ground, the rest below.\nJennison was busy bringing the best samples in to Reade, but\nhe walked so softly that Harry slept peacefully on.\n\nStill the yellow rock came up.  None of it looked like the richest\nsort of ore, but it was good gold-bearing stuff, none the less.\nTom made many assays.  It was seven in the evening ere the excited\nminers would agree to knock off work for the day.\n\nThen Tom quit and had supper with them.  There was excitement\nin the air, but Tom still counseled patience.\n\n\"We'll know more in a week than we do now,\" he urged.\n\n\"That's all right, Mr. Reade,\" laughed Tim Walsh.  \"As long as\nyou were hopeful we didn't bring up enough yellow to pay for the\ndynamite we used in blasting.  Now, boss, you're begging us not\nto be hopeful, and the luck is changing.\"\n\n\"I'm not kicking against hopefulness,\" Tom objected, smiling.\n\"All I ask of you men is not to spend the whole year's profits\nfrom the mine before we get even one load fit to haul to the smelter.\"\n\n\"We've got the ore dump started,\" retorted Jennison, \"and we don't\nhave to haul stuff to the smelter.  Boss, you can raise money\nenough without hauling a single load before spring.\"\n\n\"How?\" Tom wanted to know.\n\n\"The banks at Dugout will lend you a small fraction of the value\nof the dump as soon as they're satisfied that it has any value,\"\nJim Ferrers explained.\n\n\"I didn't know that,\" Tom admitted.\n\n\"Now you can understand why the boys are excited tonight.  They\nknow you'll outfit the camp liberally enough if the yellow streak\nholds out.\"\n\n\"Outfit the camp liberally?\" repeated Tom.  \"I'll go just as far\nin that line as my partners will stand for.\"\n\n\"We want a bang-up Christmas dinner, you see, boss,\" Tim Walsh\nexplained.  \"We wouldn't have spoken of it if this streak hadn't\npanned today.  Now, we know we're going to have doings on the\nridge this winter.\"\n\n\"If the yellow rook holds out,\" Tom urged.\n\n\"Don't say anything more in that strain, just now, Reade,\" whispered\nJim.  \"If you do, and things go badly, the boys will think you've\nbeen the camp's Jonah.\"\n\nTom went back to work in the partners' shack.  Jim came in at ten\nand went to bed.  It was midnight when Tom shook Harry by the shoulder.\n\n\"Time to get up, young man, and give me a rest,\" Tom announced.\n\nHarry got drowsily out of his bunk.\n\n\"Why didn't you call me before, Tom?\"\n\n\"Well, to tell the truth, I was too busy.  But now you may have\na few hours' work all by yourself, while I turn in,\" drawled Reade.\n\n\"Tom, old fellow, there's something up,\" discovered Hazelton,\nnow studying his chum's face keenly.  \"Out with it.\"\n\nThen Tom told of the day's luck, though he cautioned Harry against\ntoo soon growing elated.\n\n\"We'll just wait and hope,\" Reade finished.  \"Now I'll show you\nthe work that's on the bench.\"\n\nThe gold news had waked up Hazelton.  He examined eagerly the\nassay reports that Tom had filled out, then turned to the specimens\nthat awaited his attention.\n\nAt six in the morning Reade was up again, nor did Harry turn in.\nBoth were present to inspect the first tub-lot of ore that came\nup the shaft.  The yellow streak was continuing.\n\nBy the middle of the afternoon, however, the streak played out.\nThough the men worked an hour overtime they did not succeed in\nsending up any more ore.\n\n\"Just one pocket?\" wondered Tom.  \"Or does our vein run in scattered\npockets?\"\n\n\"Oh, we'll find more pockets soon,\" predicted Harry cheerily.\n\"Our luck has turned again.  It's running in the old channels.\"\n\nA feverish week passed.  Towards its end the first big snow of\nthe winter came, and the ridge was shut off from the rest of the\nworld.  It would have been all but impossible to get over even\nto the Bright Hope Mine.\n\nThe week of brisk work was using up the stock of dynamite, while\nthe rock was too hard to work much with picks.  Moreover, the\nmoney of the partners was gone.  To seek credit at Dugout would\nbe a dangerous proceeding, for those who granted the accommodation\nof credit would be sure to want a high price for it, even to a\ngoodly share in the output of the mine.  More than one mine has\nbeen taken over by creditors, and the original owners have gone\nout into the world again, poor men.\n\nSaturday morning of this week Tom and Harry descended the shaft\ntogether.  Jim was already there with the men.\n\n\"I thought we had two more boxes of dynamite, Reade,\" explained\nFerrers.  \"I find that we have just six sticks left.\"\n\n\"Then may the Fates favor us with some lucky blasts!\", muttered Tom.\n\n\"We can borrow money on our ore dump,\" suggested Harry.\n\n\"How about that?\" asked Tom, looking intently at Ferrers.\n\n\"How much do you figure there is in the dump?\" queried Jim.\n\n\"About two hundred dollars' worth of metal.\"\n\nFerrers shook his head.\n\n\"It would cost us forty dollars to cart the stuff to Dugout in\nthe Spring.  Then there'd be the smelter's charges.  We couldn't\nborrow more than fifty dollars on such security.  No bank is going\nto bother with such a small item.\"\n\nTom said nothing, but went forward to the heading of the tunnel.\nHere he made a careful examination ere he ordered the men to go\nahead.\n\nOne after another five sticks of the dynamite were fired in small\nblasts, but the ore that came out did not suggest hope.\n\nThen another drilling was made, and the sixth stick put in place,\nthe magneto wires being connected with the charge.\n\nTom himself seized the magneto handle.\n\n\"Now, hold your breaths,\" he called, cheerily.  \"This blast means\na lot, and then a bit more, to all of us.  This blast may point\nthe path to fortune!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nHARRY'S SIGNAL OF DISTRESS\n\n\nThrough the tunnel a dull boom sounded.  Then, as if by a common\nimpulse, all hands rushed back to the heading.\n\n\"Hard rock!\" muttered Reade.  \"The blast didn't make much of a\ndent.  Hand me a pick, one of you.\"\n\nThen Tom swung it with all the force and skill of which he was\npossessed.\n\nSome of the miners, who thought themselves strong men, looked on\nadmiringly as Tom swung the pick again and again.\n\nClack!  clack!  clack!\n\n\"Some muscle there,\" proclaimed Tim Walsh.  \"I didn't think it\nwas in a slim fellow like you.\"\n\n\"I haven't so much muscle,\" Tom informed him, \"but I have a tremendous\namount at stake here.  One of you shovelmen come forward and get\nthis stuff back.\"\n\nReade went tirelessly on with his pick.  Some of the big fellows\ncame forward with their tools and worked beside him.  Tom still led.\n\nFor half an hour all hands worked blithely.  Then Tom, halting,\ncalled them off.\n\n\"No use to go any further, boys, until we get some dynamite,\"\nhe declared.  \"We're striking into harder and harder rock every\nminute.  We are dulling our tools without making any headway.\"\n\n\"Dynamite?\" asked Jim Ferrers, who had been looking over the shoveled\nback rook with Harry.  \"Where are we going to get any?\"\n\n\"It's time for a council of war, I reckon,\" sighed Tom.  \"At any\nrate it's no use to work here any longer this morning.  Let's\ngo above.\"\n\nAs it was yet too early for dinner, the men congregated in one of\nthe shacks, while the partners went to their own rough one-room abode.\n\n\"What's to be done?\" asked Harry.\n\n\"I'd say quit,\" muttered Jim Ferrers.  \"Only, if we do, we lose\nour title to our claim.  Of course, I mean quit only for a while---say\nuntil spring---but even that would forfeit our title here.\"\n\n\"Then it's not to be thought of,\" rejoined Tom, with a vigorous\nshake of his head.  \"I haven't lost a bit of my faith that, one of\nthese days, this ridge is going to pay big profits to some one.\"\n\n\"We either have to quit, and give up, or stay and starve,\" rejoined\nFerrers.\n\n\"We've got to stick,\" Tom insisted.  \"In the first place, we owe\nour men a lot of money.\"\n\n\"They offered to take their chances,\" suggested Jim.\n\n\"True, but it's a debt, none the less.  I shall see everyone of\nthese men paid, even if I have to wait until I can save money\nenough at some other job to square the obligations in full.  For\nmyself, I don't intend to quit as long as I can swing a dull pick\nagainst a granite ledge.\"\n\n\"Then what did you come up for?\" asked Harry dryly.\n\n\"Because there's nothing the men can do for the present, and I\nwanted all hands to have a chance to get over their disappointment.\nJim, this snow-crust will bear the weight of a pony, won't it?\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I must get to Dugout City.\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"We haven't a big enough ore dump on which to borrow any money.\nbut I've an idea I can sell this nugget for enough to get another\ngood stock of dynamite.\"\n\n\"You don't want to try to get to Dugout today or tomorrow,\" replied\nFerrers slowly.\n\n\"But I must,\" Tom insisted.  \"Every hour's delay is worse than\nwasted time.  I must get to Dugout and back again as speedily\nas possible.\"\n\n\"Hotel living is expensive in Dugout,\" remarked Jim.\n\n\"But I don't intend to stop at a hotel for more than one meal.\"\n\n\"Have you looked at the sky?\"\n\nIt was Reade's turn to ask:\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Just go to the door and take a look at the sky,\" suggested Ferrers.\n\nTom swung the door open and looked.\n\n\"Well?\" he asked.\n\n\"What do you think of the sky?\" Jim persisted.\n\n\"It looks as though we might have a little snow,\" Tom admitted.\n\n\"A little, and then a whole lot more,\" nodded Ferrers.  \"Notice\nhow still the air is?  We're going to have a howling blizzard,\nand I believe it will start in before night.\"\n\n\"Then we'd better turn the men out to fell and chop firewood,\"\ndeclared Harry, jumping up.  \"We haven't enough on hand to last\nthrough a few days of blizzard.\"\n\n\"Will you look after the wood, Harry?\" asked Tom.  \"I want to\nkeep my mind on getting to Dugout.\"\n\n\"We'll knock over a lot of trees between now and dinner-time,\"\npromised Hazelton, as he hurried away.\n\n\"Now, Reade, you'd better give up your idea of getting to Dugout\nfor the present,\" resumed Jim Ferrers.\n\n\"But the work?  We've got to keep the men busy, and we must keep\nthe blasts a-going.\"\n\n\"You'll have to forget it for a week or so,\" insisted the Nevadan.\n\"Your freezing to death in a gale of snow wouldn't help matters any.\"\n\n\"But I must get to Dugout,\" Tom pleaded.\n\n\"You won't try it unless you're crazy,\" Jim retorted.  \"If you\nmake an attempt to stir from camp this afternoon, Reade, I'll\ncall on the men to hold you down until I can tie you.  Do you\nthink I've waited, Reade, all these years to find a partner like\nyou, and then allow him to go off in a blizzard that would sure\nfinish him?\"\n\n\"Then, if you're sure about this, Jim, I won't attempt to go until\nthe weather moderates.\"\n\n\"When the time's right I'll go,\" proposed Ferrers.  \"A pony is\nno good on this white stuff.  From some of the Swedes we've had\nworking out in this country I've learned how to make a pair of\nskis.  You can travel on skis where a pony would cut his legs\nin two against the snow crust.\"\n\n\"Then, if I'm not going to Dugout, I'll go out and swing an axe\nfor a while,\" Tom suggested.  \"I want to be of some use, and I\ncan't sit still anyway.\"\n\n\"Oh, sit down,\" urged Ferrers, almost impatiently, as he filled\nhis pipe and lighted it.  \"I'll amuse you with some stories about\nblizzards on this Range in years past.\"\n\nOutside they could hear axes ringing against the trees.  Then\nthe dinner-horn called the men in.  Soon after the meal was over\nall the horses in camp were hitched and employed in bringing in\nthe wood.  Harry was out again to superintend the men.\n\nBy half-past two the first big flakes began to come down.  There\nwas still no wind to speak of.\n\nTom had lain down in a bunk, leaving Jim to brighten the fire.\n\nFerrers, too, nodded in his chair.  It was the howling of the\nwind that awoke Tom.\n\n\"Where's Harry?\" he asked, sitting up.\n\n\"Eh?\" queried!  Ferrers, opening his eyes.\n\n\"Where's Harry!  Is he out in this storm?\"\n\n\"I've been dozing,\" Jim confessed.  \"I don't know where he is.\"\n\n\"Hear the wind howl,\" cried Tom, leaping from his bunk and pulling\non his shoes.  Then he rapidly finished dressing, Jim, in the\nmeantime, lighting the reflector lamp.\n\n\"Where on earth can Harry be?\" Tom again demanded.\n\n\"Maybe in one of the other shacks, with some of the men.\"\n\nTom threw open the door.  The snow-laden gale, sweeping in on\nhim, nearly took away his breath.  Then, after filling his lungs,\nhe started resolutely for the nearest shack.\n\n\"Mr. Hazelton in here?\" Tom called, swinging open the door.\n\n\"No, sir; thought he was with you.\"\n\nTom fought his way through the gale to the next shack.  Here Tim\nWalsh had news.\n\n\"We came in, sir, when the blizzard got too bad,\" Walsh explained,\n\"but we found we'd left one of the teams behind in the woods.\nMr. Hazelton said he'd go back and get the team.  Half an hour\nlater one of the boys here noticed that the team was standing\nup against the door of the stable shack.  So I went out and put\nup the team.\"\n\n\"Didn't it occur to you to wonder where Mr. Hazelton was?\" Tom\nasked, rather sharply.\n\n\"Why, no, sir; we thought he had gone to your shack.\"\n\n\"Mr. Hazelton wouldn't leave horses out in a storm like this one,\"\nTom rapped out briskly.  \"As a matter of fact he isn't in camp.\nYou men get out lanterns and be ready to go into the woods.\nWe've got to find Mr. Hazelton at the earliest possible moment!\"\n\nTwenty minutes later the beams of light from lanterns carried\nby the men revealed the form of Harry Hazelton, in the woods and\nnearly covered with snow.\n\n\"Pick him up,\" ordered Tom.  \"Make the fastest time you can to\nour shack.\"\n\nIn the shack the fire was allowed to burn low.  Harry, still unconscious,\nwas stripped and put to bed.\n\n\"Anything you want, let us know, sir,\" said Tim Walsh, as the men\ntramped out again.\n\nThen Tom and Ferrers sat down to try to think out the best thing\nto do for Harry Hazelton.\n\nHe was still alive, his pulse going feebly.  He had been briskly\nrubbed and warmly wrapped, and a quantity of hot, strong coffee\nforced gently down his throat.\n\nAfter a while Hazelton came to, but his eyes had a glassy look\nin them.\n\n\"You're a great one, old fellow, to go out into the snow and get\nlost,\" Tom chided him gently.\n\n\"Did---I get---lost?\" Harry asked drowsily.\n\n\"Yes.  Here, drink some more of this coffee.  Jim, make a fresh\npot.  You can stir the fire up a bit now.\"\n\n\"I---want to sleep,\" Harry protested, but Tom forced him to drink\nmore coffee.  Then Hazelton sank into a deep slumber, breathing more\nheavily.\n\n\"He's all right, now, or will be when he has slept,\" declared\nJim Ferrers.\n\n\"Is he?\" retorted Tom, who held one hand against Harry's flushed\nface, then ran the fingers down under his chum's shirt.  \"Jim, he's\nburning up with fever.  That's all that ails him!\"\n\nThen Tom placed one ear over Hazelton's heart.\n\n\"None too strong,\" Reade announced, shifting his head.  \"And here's\na wheezy sound in his right lung that I don't like at all.\"\n\n\"You don't suppose it's pneumonia?\" asked Jim gravely.\n\nIt was congestion of the right lung that ailed Harry Hazelton.\nBut Tom knew nothing of that.  Jim Ferrers, who had never been\nill in his life, knew even less about sickness.\n\nAs for Harry, he lay dangerously ill, with a doctor's help out\nof the question!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nTOM TURNS DOCTOR\n\n\nThe door opened almost noiselessly.\n\n\"Shut that door,\" cried Tom, angrily, without looking around.\n\"Whoever you are, do you know that we have a sick man here\"\n\n\"Well, the men chased me out of one shack, and wouldn't let me\nin the other, and I don't want to go near the cook,\" complained\na whining young voice.\n\nIt was Alf Drew who uttered the words.\n\n\"Shut the door,\" Tom repeated.\n\n\"May I stay here?\" asked Alf, after obeying.\n\n\"I suppose so, though we have about enough trouble here already.\nWhy did the men chase you out of their shack?\"\n\n\"They said they couldn't stand the smell of cigarettes,\" Drew\nreplied.\n\n\"I don't wonder at that,\" muttered Tom.\n\n\"They were all smoking.  I don't see why I couldn't smoke, too,\"\nAlf whined.\n\n\"That's just the point,\" Tom returned.  \"The men were smoking.\nNow, as I've told you before, the use of cigarettes isn't smoking\nat all.  You annoyed men who were minding their own business.\"\n\n\"They're a mean lot,\" complained young Drew.  Being cold he went\nover to the fire to warm himself.  Then he drew a cigarette from\none of his pockets, and struck a match.  Tom Reade, slipping up\nbehind the youngster, deftly took the cigarette away from him,\ntossing it into the fire.\n\n\"You'll have to quit that,\" Tom ordered sternly.  \"If I catch\nyou trying to light a cigarette then out you go.  We have a man\nhere sick with lung trouble and with a high fever, and we don't\npropose to have any cigarette smoke around here.\"\n\n\"What am I going to do, then?\" asked Alf, after a minute or so\nspent in a kind of trance.\n\n\"Do anything you please, as long as you keep quiet and don't light\nany cigarettes,\" Tom suggested, rummaging in the cupboard for\na medicine chest that he knew was there.\n\n\"But I'll go to pieces, if I can't smoke a cigarette or two,\" whined\nthe boy.\n\nTom had the medicine chest in his lap by this time.  His hand\ntouched a bottle of pellets labeled \"quassia.\"\n\n\"Here, chew on one of these, and you won't need your cigarette,\"\nTom suggested, passing over a pellet.\n\nAlf mutely took the pellet, crushing it with his teeth.\n\n\"Ugh!\" he uttered disgustedly.\n\n\"Don't spit it out,\" urged Tom.  \"It's the best thing possible to\ntake the place of a cigarette.  Keep it in your mouth until it is\nall dissolved.\"\n\nAlf made a wry face, but knew he must obey Tom.  So he stuck to\nthe pellet until the last of it had dissolved on his tongue.  The\npellet was gone, but the taste wasn't.\n\n\"Ugh!\" grunted the youngster.\n\n\"You said that before,\" urged Tom.  \"Try to be original.  Want\nanother pellet?\"\n\n\"No; I don't.  I wouldn't touch one again!\"\n\n\"Don't happen to want a cigarette, either, do you?\"\n\n\"I don't want anything, now, but just to get that taste out of\nmy mouth,\" Alf uttered.\n\n\"All right; go over in the corner and keep quiet.  Jim, do you\nknow anything about the use of the medicines in this chest?\"\n\n\"Not a blessed thing,\" Ferrers replied regretfully.  \"I never\ntook as much as a pinhead of medicine in my life.\"\n\n\"But Harry must have something,\" Tom insisted.  \"We can't let\nhim lie there and die.\"\n\nIt was one of those ready-made medicine chests that are sold to\ncampers and others who must live at a considerable distance from\nmedical aid.  Finding a small book of instructions in the chest,\nTom moved over under the strong light and settled himself to read\nthoughtfully.\n\nHarry tossed restlessly, unmindful of what was going on around\nhim.  His heavy, rapid breathing filled the place.  Once in a\nwhile he moaned slightly, every sound of this kind going through\nTom like a knife.\n\nA particularly deep moan caused Tom to shiver and close the book.\nHe went over and felt Harry's hot, drier skin.\n\n\"Jim,\" he directed, \"I'm sure that, somehow, we should force the\nperspiration through his dry, parched skin.  Take some of the\nblankets out of my bunk and spread them over Harry.\"\n\n\"It'll make his fever worse, won't it?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know,\" Tom admitted helplessly.  \"We'd better\ntry it for a while, anyway.\"\n\nThen Tom stood looking down at the flushed face of his chum, muttering\nbelow his breath:\n\n\"Harry, old fellow, I wish your mother were here.  She'd know\njust what to do.  And for your mother's sake, as well as my own,\nI've just got to blunder into something that will cure you.\"\n\nHeaving a sigh, Tom went back under the lamp to read with blurted\neyes.\n\nAt last he struck a paragraph that he thought bore on the case in\nhand.  He read eagerly, praying for light.\n\n\"I've got it, at last,\" he announced, moving over to the bunk, beside\nwhich Ferrers stood.\n\n\"Got what?\" asked Jim.\n\n\"I believe I'm on the track of the right stuff to give poor old Harry.\"\n\n\"What's the name of the stuff you're going to give harry\"\n\n\"There are three medicines mentioned here,\" replied Reade, holding\nup the book.  \"They're all to be given.\"\n\n\"_Three_ medicines!\" gasped Jim.  \"By the great Custer three are\nenough to kill a horse!\"\n\n\"I'm going to try 'em,\" sighed Tom stolidly.  \"The poor fellow will\ndie if nothing is done for him.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't it be better,\" suggested Ferrers, hopelessly, \"to try\none medicine on the lad and then wait ten minutes.  Then, if that\ndoesn't work, try one of the others on him!  If that doesn't work\nthen you know that the third kind of stuff is the right sort of\nbracer.\"\n\nDespite his great anxiety, Reade could not suppress the smile that\nJim's advice brought out.  It was plain that Ferrers, good fellow\nas he was, would be of no use on the medical end of the fight that\nmust be waged.\n\nTom searched the chest and found the medicines.  Then he looked\nup the doses and started to administer the remedies as directed.\n\nEven over the steadily increasing gale the notes of the supper\nhorn reached them faintly.\n\n\"It's too tough weather to expect the cook to bring the stuff\nover here tonight,\" said Jim.  \"So, if you can spare me, I'll\ngo and eat with the boys.  Then I'll bring your chuck over to\nyou.\"\n\nAlf came out of his corner, pulling on the ragged overcoat that\nhe had picked up in a trade with an undersized man down at the\nBright Hope Mine.\n\nLeft alone, Tom drew a stool up beside the bunk, and sat studying\nhis chum's face.\n\nTwenty minutes later Hazelton opened his eyes.\n\n\"You're feeling better, now, aren't you?\" asked Tom hopefully.\n\n\"I---I guess so,\" Harry muttered faintly.\n\n\"Where does it hurt you most, chum?\"\n\n\"In---in my chest.\"\n\n\"Right lung!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Is the pain severe, Harry?\"\n\n\"It's about all I can---can stand---old fellow.\"\n\n\"Poor chap.  Don't try to talk, now.  We're taking good care of\nyou, and we'll keep on the job day and night.  You've had some\nmedicine, though you didn't know it.  Now, try to sleep, if you\ncan.\"\n\nBut Hazelton couldn't sleep.  He tossed restlessly, his face aflame\nwith fever.\n\nJim Ferrers came back with the supper, but Reade could eat very\nlittle of it.  Alf Drew did not return.  He had made his peace with\nthe workmen.\n\nThrough the night Harry grew steadily worse.  When daylight came\nin, with the blizzard still raging, the young engineer was delirious.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nTHE WOLVES ON THE SNOW CRUST\n\n\nThe blizzard lasted for two days.  Toward the end the temperature\nrose, with the result that three feet of loose snow lay on top\nof the harder packed snow underneath.\n\nHarry Hazelton had passed out of the delirium, but he was weak,\nand apparently sinking.  He was conscious, though he spoke but\nlittle, nor did poor Tom seek to induce him to talk.\n\nBy this time Reade knew the little medicine book by heart.  He\nalso knew the label and dose of every drug in the case.  But he\nhad not been able to improve upon his first selection of treatment.\n\n\"Do you think he's going to die, Jim?\" Tom frequently asked.\n\n\"What's the use of a strong young fellow like him dying?\" demanded\nFerrers.\n\n\"Then why doesn't he get better?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  But he'll come around all right.  Don't worry\nabout that.  Strong men don't go under from a cold in the head,\nor from a bit of wheeze in the lungs.\"\n\n\"But the fever.\"\n\n\"That has to burn itself out, I reckon,\" replied the Nevadan.\n\"Reade, you'll be sick yourself next.  Lay out the medicines, and\nI'll give 'em, to the minute, while you get six hours' sleep.\"\n\n\"No, sir!\" was Reade's quick retort.\n\n\"Then, before you do cave in, partner, suppose you pick out the\nmedicines that you want me to give you when you can't do anything\nfor yourself any longer.\"\n\nTom went back to his chair by the side of Harry's bunk.\n\nOutdoors some of the men were clearing a path to the mine-shaft.\nNot that it was worth while to try to do any work underground.\nThe rock at the tunnel heading was too stubborn to be moved by\nanything less than dynamite.\n\n\"I'd get some lumber together, and make a pair of skis,\" suggested\nJim, the next day, \"but what is the use?  We'll have to have\ntwenty-four hours of freezing weather before we'll have a crust.\nAs soon as we can see snow that will bear a human being I'll start\nfor Dugout City.\"\n\n\"But not for dynamite,\" declared Tom.\n\n\"No; for a doctor, I suppose.\"\n\n\"A physician's visit is the only thing I'm interested in now,\"\nTom declared, glancing at the bunk.  \"I'd give up any mine on\nearth to be able to pull poor old Harry through.\"\n\nOn the fifth day, while the weather still remained too warm for\nthe forming of a snow-crust, Harry began to show signs of improvement.\nHe was gaunt and thin, but his skin felt less hot to the touch.\nHis eyes had lost some of the fever brightness, and he spoke\nof the pain in his chest as being less severe than it had been.\n\n\"I've been an awful nuisance here,\" he whispered, weakly, as his\nchum bent over him.\n\n\"Stow all that kind of talk,\" Reade ordered.  \"Just get your strength\nback as fast as you can.  Sleep all you can, too.  Get a nap, now,\nand maybe when you wake up you'll be hungry enough to want a little\nsomething to eat.\"\n\n\"I don't want anything,\" Harry replied.\n\n\"He's a goner, sure!\" gasped Tom Reade, inwardly, feeling a great\nchill of fear creep up and down his spine.  \"It's the first time\nin his life that I ever knew Harry to refuse to eat.\"\n\n\"The weather is coming on cold,\" Jim Ferrers reported that evening,\nwhen he came back from the coon shack with Tom's supper.\n\n\"Is it going to be cold enough to put a crust on the snow?\" Reade\neagerly demanded.\n\n\"If it keeps on growing cold we ought to have a good crust by\nthe day after tomorrow.\"\n\n\"I'll pray for it,\" said Tom fervently.\n\nNext day the weather continued intensely cold.  Jim Ferrers went\nto another shack to construct a pair of skis.  These are long,\nwooden runners on which Norwegians travel with great speed over\nhard snow.  Jim was positive that he could make the skis and that\nhe could use them successfully.\n\nHarry still remained weak and ill, caring nothing for food, though\nhis refusals to eat drove Reads well-nigh frantic.\n\nThe morning after the skis were made, Jim Ferrers, who had relieved\nworn-out Tom at three in the morning, stepped to the young engineer's\nbunk and shook him lightly.\n\n\"All right,\" said Reade, sitting up in bed.  \"I'll get up.\"\n\nHe was out of the bunk almost instantly.\n\n\"I'm going to send Tim Walsh in to help you a bit,\" Jim whispered.\n\"The crust is right this morning, and I'm off for Dugout.  Before\nwe forget it give me that nugget.\"\n\nTom passed it over, saying solemnly:\n\n\"Remember, Jim, you've got to bring a doctor back with you---if\nyou have to do it at the point of a gun!\"\n\n\"I'll bring one back with me, if there's one left in Dugout,\"\nFerrers promised, fervently.\n\nFifteen minutes later Jim was on his way.  Tim Walsh came in on\ntip-toe, and seemed afraid to stir lest he make some slight sound\nto disturb the sleeping sick lad.\n\n\"A day or two more will tell the tale, Tim,\" Tom whispered in\nthe big miner's ear.\n\n\"Oh, it isn't as bad as that, sir; it can't be,\" protested the big\nfellow in a hoarse whisper.  \"I reckon Mr. Hazelton is going to get\nwell all right.\"\n\n\"He won't eat anything,\" said Tom.\n\n\"He will when he's hungry, sir.\"\n\n\"Tim, have you ever had any practice in looking after sick people?\"\n\n\"Quite a bit, sir.  When I was a younker I was private in the\nhospital corps in the Army.\"\n\n\"Why on earth didn't you tell me that before?\" Tom gasped.\n\n\"Why, because, sir, I allowed that a brainy young man like you\nwould know just what to do a heap better than I would.\"\n\n\"Tim, do you know anything about temperatures and drugs?\"\n\n\"Maybe I'd remember a little bit,\" Walsh answered modestly.  \"It's\ntwelve years since I was in the Army.\"\n\nTom brought the medicine case with trembling hands.\n\n\"To think that, all the time,\" he muttered, \"I've been longing\nfor a doctor's visit, and yet I've had a man in camp who's almost\na doctor.\"\n\n\"No, sir; a long way from that,\" protested Tim Walsh.  \"And, besides,\nI've forgotten a whole lot that I used to know.\"\n\nTom rapidly explained how he had been treating Hazelton, according\nto the directions in the little medicine book.  Tim listened gravely.\n\"Was that all right, Tim?\" Tom asked, breathlessly, when he had\nfinished.\n\n\"I should say about all right, sir.\"\n\n\"Tim, what shall I do next?\"\n\n\"Do you want me to tell you, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes!\"\n\n\"Then I might as well do it, sir, as tell you,\" Tim drawled out.\n\"Mr. Reade, you're worn to pieces.  You get into your bunk and\nI'll take charge for an hour.\"\n\n\"I want to see you do the things you know how to do.\"\n\n\"Not a thing will I do, Mr. Reade, unless you get into your bunk\nfor an hour,\" declared Walsh, sturdily.\n\n\"Will you call me in an hour, if I lie down?\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\n\"You'll call me in an hour?\"\n\n\"On my honor, Mr. Reade.\"\n\nTim Walsh thereupon bundled the young engineer into another bunk,\ncovered him up, and then watched until Tom Reade, utterly exhausted,\nfell into a deep sleep that was more like a trance.\n\n\"But I didn't say in which hour I'd call him,\" muttered Walsh\nunder his breath, his eyes twinkling.  Then he tip-toed over to\nlook at Harry Hazelton, who, also, was asleep.  Through the whole\nday Tom slept nor did the ex-Army nurse once quit the shack.\n\nWhen dark came Tim Walsh had just finished lighting the lamp and\nshading it when he turned to find Tom Reade glaring angrily into\nhis eyes.\n\n\"Tim, what does this treachery mean?\" Reade questioned in a\nhoarse whisper.\n\n\"It means, sir, that you had tired yourself out so that you were\nno longer fit to nurse your partner.  He was in bad hands, taking\nhis medicines and his care from a man as dog-tired as you were,\nMr. Reade.  It also means, sir, that I've been looking after Mr.\nHazelton all day, and he's a bit better this evening.  Him and\nme had a short chat this afternoon, and you never heard us.  Mr.\nHazelton went to sleep only twenty minutes ago.  When he wakes\nup you can feel his skin and take his pulse, and you'll find him\ndoing better.\"\n\n\"Tim, I know you meant it for the best, and that I ought to be\nthankful to you,\" Tom murmured, \"but, man, I've a good notion\nto skin you alive!\"\n\n\"You'd better not try anything like that, sir,\" grinned Walsh.\n\"Remember that I'm in charge here, now, and that you're only\na visitor.  If you interfere between me and my patient, Mr. Reade,\nI'll put you out of here and bar the door against you.\"\n\nTom, though angry at having been allowed to sleep for so long,\nhad the quick good sense to see that the big miner was quite right.\n\n\"All right, Tim Walsh,\" he sighed.  \"If you can take better care\nof my chum than I can then you're the new boss here.  I'll be good.\"\n\n\"First of all,\" ordered Walsh, \"go over to the cook shack and\nget some supper.  Don't dare to come back inside of an hour, so\nyou'll have time to eat a real supper.\"\n\nTom departed obediently.  Once out in the keen air he began to\nunderstand how much good his day's sleep had done him.  He was\nalive and strong again.  Taking in deep breaths, he tramped along\nthe path over to the shaft ere he turned his steps toward the\ncook shack.\n\n\"Come right in, Mr. Reade, and eat something,\" urged Cook Leon.\n\"This is the first time I've seen you in days.  You must be hungry.\"\n\n\"There's a fellow ten times smarter than I who's looking after\nHazelton,\" spoke Tom cheerily, \"so I believe I am hungry.  Yes;\nyou may set me out a good supper.\"\n\n\"Who's the very smart man that's looking after your friend?\" Leon\nasked.\n\n\"Tim Walsh.\"\n\n\"Why, he's nothing but a miner!\"\n\n\"You're wrong there, Leon.  Walsh has been a soldier, and a hospital\ncorps man at that.  He knows more about nursing in a minute than\nI do in a month.  Oh, why didn't I hear about Walsh earlier?\"\n\nLeon soon had a steaming hot supper on the table.  First of all,\nReade swallowed a cupful of coffee.  Then he began his supper.\n\n\"I wonder if Ferrers can get back tonight?\" Tom mused, after the\nmeal.\n\n\"He might, but a doctor couldn't get here tonight, unless he,\ntoo, could move fast on skis,\" Leon replied.\n\n\"Anyway, I'm not as worried as I was,\" sighed Reade.\n\nThe door opened, and Alf Drew entered.  That youngster rarely\ncame to the cook shack alone, but the lad learned that Tom Reade\nwas present.\n\n\"Sit down and keep quiet, if you're going to stay here,\" ordered\nCook Leon.\n\nAlf went to the corner of the shack furthest from the other two.\nTom, watching covertly, saw Alf furtively draw out cigarette\nand match.\n\nVery softly Drew scratched a match.  He was standing, his back\nturned to the others, over a wood-box.\n\nClick-ick-ick! sounded a warning note.\n\n\"Ow-ow-ow-ow!\" howled Alf, jumping back, dropping both match and\ncigarette.\n\n\"What's the matter, youngster?\" demanded Tom placidly.\n\n\"There's a rattlesnake in there under the wood,\" wailed the boy,\nhis face ashen.\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"I heard him rattle!\"\n\nLeon, too, had heard the sound, and would have started after a\npoker, intent on killing the reptile, had he not seen Tom shake\nhis head, a twinkle in his eye.\n\n\"There are no rattlesnakes about in the dead of winter on this\nRange,\" Tom declared positively.\n\n\"That one has been keeping hisself warm in the bottom of the wood-box,\"\ninsisted Alf.\n\nClick-ick-ick!\n\n\"There, didn't you hear it?\" quivered the cigarette fiend.\n\n\"I heard no rattler,\" declared Tom, innocently.  \"Did you, Leon?\"\n\nThe cook thought, to be sure that he had heard one, but he caught\nthe cue from Reade and answered in the negative.\n\n\"Go and turn the wood-box out, Leon, to show the young man that\nthere's no snake there,\" Tom requested.\n\nJust then that task was hardly welcome to the cook, but he was\na man of nerve, and, in addition, he reasoned that Reade must\nknow what he was talking about.  So Leon crossed the room with\nan air of unconcern.\n\n\"Here's your rattlesnake, I reckon,\" growled the cook, picking\nup Alf's dropped cigarette and tossing it toward the boy.\n\n\"That's the only rattlesnake on the Range,\" Tom pursued.  \"I've\nbeen trying to tell Alf that cigarettes are undermining his nerves\nand making him hear and see things.\"\n\nLeon unconcernedly overturned the wood-box.  Alf, with a yell,\nran and jumped upon a stool, standing there, his eyes threatening\nto pop out from sheer terror.\n\nLeon began to stir the firewood about with his foot.\n\nClick-ick-ick!\n\nAlf howled with terror, and seemed in danger of falling from the\nstool.\n\n\"You'll keep on hearing rattlers, I expect,\" grunted Reade, \"when\nall the time it's nothing but the snapping of your nerves from\nsmoking cigarettes.  The next thing you know your brain will snap\nutterly.\"\n\nClick-ick-ick!  On his stool Alf danced a mild war-dance from\nsheer nervousness.\n\n\"Come, be like a man, and give up the pests,\" advised Tom.\n\n\"I---I---be-believe I will,\" half agreed the lad.\n\nClick-ick-ick-ick!\n\n\"Didn't you hear that?\" quavered the youngster.\n\n\"I hear your voice, but no rattlers,\" Reade went on.  \"Are you\nstill hearing the snakes?  Be a man, Alf!  Come, empty your pockets\nof cigarettes and throw them in the fire.\"\n\nLike one in a dream Alf Drew obeyed.  Then he sat down, and presently\nhe began to recover from the worst of his fright.\n\nWhen his hour was up, Tom Reade went back to the other shack.\nHarry was awake, and feeling rather comfortable under big Walsh's\nministrations.\n\nSoon after nine that night, the camp lay wrapped in slumber, save\nin the partner's shack, where the shaded light burned.  Tim Walsh\nwas still on duty, while Tom sat half dozing in a chair.\n\nFor the first time in days the young chief engineer was fairly\ncontented in mind.  He now believed that his chum would surely\nrecover.\n\nHad Tom been outside, hidden and keeping alert watch over the\nsurroundings, his content would have vanished into action.\n\nIn the deep darkness of the night, Dolph Gage glided about on\nthe firm snow crust at the further side of the mine shaft.  With\nhim, looking more like two evil shadows or spectres, were his\ntwo remaining companions.\n\nMost of the time since they had been seen last, Gage and his\nconfederates had been within a mile or so of Reade's camp.  They\nhad found a cave in which they had been passably comfortable.\nFor food they had depended upon the fact that the commissary at\nthe Bright Hope Mine was easily burglarized, and that no very\nstrict account was kept of the miners' food.  Thus the three\nscoundrels had managed not only to hide themselves from the law's\nofficers, but to keep themselves comfortable as well.\n\n\"Now we can fix these youngsters, and slide back to our hiding\nplace during the excitement,\" Gage whispered to his two friends.\n\"This crowd is broke.  If we fix the mine in earnest tonight\nthey won't be able to open it again.  With the dynamite we brought\nup from the Bright Hope on this sled we can fire a blast that\nwill starve and drive Reade and Hazelton away from the Indian\nSmoke Range for good and all!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nDOLPH GAGE FIRES HIS SHOT\n\n\n\"Yes, if we don't blow ourselves to kingdom come in the effort,\"\ngrowled the man known as Josh.\n\n\"You're talking bosh!\" grunted Dolph.  \"Why should we blow ourselves\nup?  Is this the first time we've used dynamite!\"\n\n\"But there's such a lot of the stuff,\" grunted Josh.  \"We must\nhave a hundred and fifty sticks on the sled.\"\n\n\"All of that,\" nodded Gage.\n\n\"If the stuff goes oh accidentally, when we're near-----\"\n\n\"Then our troubles will be over,\" said Gage grimly.\n\n\"I'm not so all-fired anxious to have my troubles over that way,\"\ngrumbled Josh.  The other man said nothing, but he looked extremely\nthoughtful.\n\n\"The best way to make the thing sure,\" Gage went on, \"is to get\nto work before some one comes prowling this way.\"\n\n\"Who's going to prowl?\" queried Josh.  \"The camp is asleep.\"\n\n\"Reade is up; we know that,\" Dolph insisted.\n\n\"Humph!  We saw through the window that he's too drowsy to stir.\"\n\n\"Don't be too sure,\" warned Gage.  \"He may be only a boy, but\nhe's a sure terror, the way he finds out things!  He may be out\nat any time.  Come, we'll hustle, and then get away from here.\"\n\n\"I'm ready,\" said the third man.\n\n\"Then get on to the top ladder,\" ordered Dolph.  \"When you're\ndown about fifteen feet, then stop and light your lantern.  We'll\neach do the same.\"\n\nDolph waited until the other two had reached the bottom of the\nshaft and he could see their lanterns.  Then he, too, descended,\nlighting two more lanterns after he reached firm ground.\n\n\"Where are you going to set the stuff off?\" Josh asked.\n\n\"In two places,\" Gage answered.  \"One big pile in the tunnel,\nhalf-way between the heading and the shaft, and the other at the\nbottom of the shaft.  Get picks and a couple of shovels, and we'll\nsoon lay mines and tamp 'em.\"\n\nWhile the men were obeying, Gage reclimbed the ladders.  Roping\nabout a third of the dynamite sticks, and passing a loop over\none shoulder, he succeeded in carrying the dynamite below.  In\ntwo more trips he brought down the rest.  The fourth trip he came\ndown with a magneto and several coils of light firing wire.\n\nOn account of their industry the time slipped by rapidly.  As\na matter of fact their wicked task occupied them for nearly four\nhours.  However, no sound of what went on underground reached\nthe ears of those who slept in the shacks.\n\n\"We're ready for the wiring,\" announced Josh at last.\n\n\"I'll do that myself,\" said Gage.  \"I want it well done.  Each\nof you hold a lantern here.\"\n\nBy the light thus provided Dolph attached the light wires so that\nthe electric spark would be communicated to each stick in this\n\"mine.\"  This was done by looping a circuit wire around each separate\nstick, and connecting the wire with each detonating cap.  The\ndynamite, frozen on the snow crust, had thawed again at this\nsubterranean level.\n\n\"Now, for the last tamping,\" ordered Gage.\n\nWhile the others worked, Dolph carefully superintended their operations.\n\nAt last the tamping was done, and the connecting wires were carried\nback to the bottom of the shaft.\n\nHere the second mine was connected in the same manner, and the wires\njoined so that the circuit should be complete.\n\n\"One spark from the magneto, now,\" chuckled Dolph, \"and both blasts\nwill go on at once.  Whew!  This old ridge will rock for a few\nseconds!\"\n\nFor a few moments he stood surveying his work with huge satisfaction.\n\n\"Now, get up with you,\" he ordered.  \"Remember, at the bottom of the\nlast ladder, blow out your lanterns.\"\n\n\"The wires?\" queried Josh.\n\n\"I'll carry 'em.  All you have to do is to get out of here.\"\n\nIn quivering silence the three evil-doers ascended.  The light\nof their lanterns extinguished, they stepped out of the shaft\nand once more on the hard snow crust.\n\n\"Now, take the magneto back about two hundred feet, leaving the\nwires stretched on the snow,\" whispered Dolph.\n\n\"Who's that coming?\" Josh demanded, in sudden alarm, clutching\nhis leader's sleeve.\n\nFor an instant all three men quailed.  But they remained silent,\npeering.\n\n\"Don't get any more dreams, Josh,\" Dolph ordered sharply.  \"There's\nno one coming.  It's all in your nerves.\"\n\n\"I was sure I heard some one coming.\" Josh insisted in a whisper.\n\n\"But you didn't\"\n\n\"What if some one comes now?\"\n\n\"No one is coming.\"\n\n\"But if some one should?\"\n\n\"All the more reason for getting our work done with speed.  Once\nwe've connected the magneto and fired the blast our whole job\nwill be done.\"\n\nJosh, only half-convinced, drew a revolver and cocked the weapon.\n\n\"Now, be mighty careful!\" snarled Dolph.  \"Don't get rattled and\nshoot at any shadows!  A shot might spoil our plans tonight, for\nit would bring men tumbling out this way as soon as they could\nget out of their bunks and into some clothes.  Give me that pistol!\"\n\nJosh, hesitating, obeyed, whereupon Dolph Gage let down the hammer\nnoiselessly, next dropping the weapon into a pocket of his own\nbadly-frayed overcoat.\n\n\"Now, get the magneto back, as I told you.  I'll take care of\nthe wires and see that they don't snap or get tangled.\"\n\nThis latter part of the work was quickly executed.  Dolph deftly\nattached the wires to the magneto, then seized the handle, prepared\nto pump.\n\n\"All ready, now!\" he whispered gleefully.  \"Two or three pumps,\nand damage will be done that it would cost at least fifteen thousand\ndollars' worth of material and labor to remedy.  The kid engineers\nhaven't the money and can't raise it.  They'll have to give up---be\ndriven out.  Then we'll send our own man, who has his mineral rights,\nin here to take possession, and the mine will be ours once more---as\nit always has been by rights.\"\n\n\"Let us get a little way to the rear before you fire the blasts,\"\npleaded Josh.\n\n\"Go back a couple of hundred feet, if you want,\" assented Dolph.\n\"But don't you run away!  Remember that part of your job is to\nstand by me if we're followed and fired upon.\"\n\nJosh and his companion carefully made their way back over the crust.\n\nDolph Gage waited until he saw them to be a sufficient distance away.\n\n\"Now, work away, my magneto beauty\" muttered Gage, exultantly.\n\"Do your work, straight and true.  Drive these upstarts off of\nIndian Smoke Range and bring my mine back into my own hands!\nThese fool engineers have found no gold in the ridge, but it's\nthere---waiting for me.  And---now!\"\n\nHe pumped the handle of the magneto vigorously.  In another instant\nthe spark traveled.\n\nFrom underground there came a sudden rocking, followed, after\na breathless interval, by a loud, crashing boom.\n\nBoth blasts had exploded in the same instant, and the dynamite\nhad done its work!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nTOM BEGINS TO DOUBT HIS EYES\n\n\nWhen the shock came it shook the shacks so that nearly all of the\nsleeping miners became instantly alert.\n\nHarry Hazelton, dozing lightly, sat up in bed, then felt dizzy and\nlay down again.\n\n\"You keep on your pillow, Mr. Hazelton,\" Tim Walsh ordered, gently.\n\"It isn't your time to sit up yet, sir.\"\n\n\"What was the racket?\" asked Harry, anxiously.\n\n\"A blast in the mine,\" Tom Reade answered, truthfully enough.\n\n\"I didn't know we had any dynamite left,\" persisted Harry.\n\n\"You haven't been in a condition to know all that has been going\non for the last few days,\" Tom retorted, gently.  \"Now, don't\nask me any more questions, for I've got to go out and see how\nthe blast came along.\"\n\nAs he spoke Tom was hustling into his coat and pulling his cap\ndown over his ears.\n\nThen, full of the liveliest anxiety, the young chief engineer\nhastened out.\n\nHis instant conclusion had been that some treachery was afoot,\nbut whence it came he had no idea.  Just now Tom Reade wanted\nfacts, not conjectures.\n\nAs he closed the door and hurried across the camp, Tom found the\naroused miners flocking out.  Several of them bore rifles, for\nthey, too, had guessed treachery.\n\n\"Here's the boss!\"\n\n\"What's happened, Mr. Reade?\"\n\n\"Men,\" Tom called softly, \"I don't know what's up.  But don't\ntalk loudly or excitedly, for Hazelton has been aroused by the\nnoise and the shake, and I've tried to turn it off.  Don't let\nhim hear your voices.\"\n\n\"It was in the mine, sir, wasn't it?\" asked one man, hurrying\nto Reade's side.\n\n\"It must have been, Hunter.  Come along, all of you.  We'll go\nover to the shaft and take a look.\"\n\nSeveral of the men were carrying lighted lanterns.  At the shaft\none of the first evidences they discovered was the wires running\nback to the magneto.\n\n\"Trickery, here!\" muttered one of the men.  \"Mr. Reade, shall\nwe try to pick up a trail and follow it?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Tom, after a moment's thought.  \"It would be wasted\ntime.  Even if you pick up a trail on this frozen crust, which\nis hardly likely, you couldn't follow it except by lantern light.\nThat would be slow work.  Besides, it would show the rascals\nwhere you were and how fast you were moving.  They could fire\nat you easily.  No; let's have a look at the damage.\"\n\nLooking down the shaft, with their rim light, from the top, all\nlooked as usual about the shaft.\n\n\"Hand me one of the lanterns,\" called Tom.  \"Hunter, you take\nanother and come with me.\"\n\n\"Careful, sir,\" warned another man.  \"The blasts may not be all\nover as yet.\"\n\nTom Reade smiled.\n\n\"The blasts were fired by magneto,\" he explained.  \"There can't\nbe any more blasts, unless some enemy should sneak back and adjust\nthe magneto to some other 'mine.' You won't let any one down the\nshaft for that purpose, I know.\"\n\nThere was a laugh, amid which Tom and Hunter descended.  Near\nthe bottom of the third ladder Reade found that the rest of the\nway down the shaft had been blocked by the smashing of the ladders.\n\n\"Go up, Hunter,\" the young engineer directed, \"and start the men\nto knotting ropes and splicing 'em.  We want at least a hundred\nfeet of knotted rope.\"\n\nTom waited on the last solid rung while this order was being carried\nout.  By and by Hunter reached him with one end of a long, knotted\nline.\n\n\"Don't pass down any more,\" Tom called, \"until I have made this\nend fast.\"\n\nThis was soon done, and the rest of the rope was lowered.\n\n\"Hunter,\" Tom asked, \"are you good for going down a hundred feet\nor so on a knotted rope?\"\n\n\"I don't believe I am, sir.\"\n\n\"Then don't try it.  Go up and send down two or three men who\nfeel sure they can do it.  But urge every man against taking the\nrisk foolishly.  For a man who can't handle himself on a knotted\nrope it's a fine and easy way to break his neck.\"\n\n\"Are you going down now, sir?\"\n\n\"At once.\"\n\n\"Then I'll stay here and hold a lantern for you,\" replied Hunter,\ndoggedly.  \"I won't stir until I know you're safe at the bottom\nof the shaft.\"\n\n\"Go ahead up,\" ordered Tom.  \"I'm tying a lantern to my coat.\"\n\nThis he was even then doing, in fact, making the knot with a\nhandkerchief passed through one of the button-holes of the garment.\n\n\"Why don't you go up, with my message, Hunter?\" Tom demanded.\n\n\"I'm afraid I can't stir, sir, until I know that you're safe at\nthe bottom.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!  What could you do to save me if I lost my hold and fell?\"\nTom questioned.\n\n\"Nothing at all, sir; but I'll feel a heap easier when I know you're\nsafe at the bottom.\"\n\n\"All right, then,\" called Reade.  \"Watch me!\"\n\nHe swung off into space with the skill and sureness of the practiced\nathlete.  A little later Tom touched bottom, calling up:\n\n\"Now, get busy, Hunter.  I'm all right.\"\n\n\"Are you at the bottom of the shaft, sir?\"\n\n\"I'm on solid ground, but I'm not sure about being at the bottom\nof the shaft.  I'm afraid the opening to the tunnel has been blocked.\nSend down two or three men, and then some tools.  The tools can\ncome down in the tub, but forbid any men to try that way.  The\ntub is too uncertain and likely to tip over.\"\n\n\"If the tub tips out a pick or two, they might fall on you, sir,\nand wind up your life,\" Hunter objected.\n\n\"That's a chance to which no good sport can object,\" laughed Tom.\n\"Go ahead and see that my instructions are carried out.\"\n\nOne of the men came down the rope first.  He landed safely, but\nlooked at his hands in the dim light.\n\n\"That's a hard road to travel, Mr. Reade,\" he remarked.  \"I'll\nnot be much pleased with the trip back.\"\n\n\"It's easy to any one who has had enough practice,\" Tom observed,\nmildly.\n\nThen two other men came down in turn.\n\n\"We've enough men here,\" shouted Reade.  \"Now send tools.\"\n\nBefore long the young engineer had his little force busily engaged.\n\nOf course, many of the timbers had been blown out of the walling\nof the shaft.  There was danger of the dirt caving in on the few\nworkers below.\n\n\"Now, you four can keep going, digging straight down and to the\neastward,\" said Tom.  \"I'm going up to get some more men at work,\nputting in temporary walling.  I don't want any of you men hurt\nby saving dirt from the sides of the shaft.\"\n\nAll four men stopped work at once.\n\n\"What's the matter!\" asked Reade.\n\n\"Coming down's easy, sir; we're waiting to see you go _up_\nthat rope.\"\n\n\"Then I'll endeavor not to keep you long away from your tasks,\"\nsmiled the young engineer athlete.\n\nGrasping the rope just above a knot over his head, Tom gave a\nslight heave, then went rapidly up, hand over hand.  He was soon\nlost from the little circle of light thrown by the lanterns at\nthe shaft's bottom.\n\n\"Not many men like him,\" remarked one of the miners named Tibbets,\nadmiringly.\n\n\"I've been told that's what young fellers learn at college,\" said\nanother miner, as he spat on his hands and raised his pick.\n\nFor two hours Reade attended to the mending of the walling, as\nthe system of laying walls in shafts is termed.  Ladders had to\nbe rebuilt even in order to put temporary walling in place.\n\nThen the young chief engineer deemed it time to run over to the\npartners' shack.  He opened the door softly, peeping in.  Feeling\nthe draught Tim Walsh turned and came to the door.\n\n\"Mr. Hazelton is doing all right, sir.\"\n\n\"Has he asked for me?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"If he does, tell him that I'm putting in all night at the mine.\nIf he gets worse run over and get me.\"\n\nThen Tom went back to his labors.\n\nDolph Gage and his fellow rascals, owing to their haste, and also\nto the fact that they did not know as much as they thought they\ndid about laying and tamping blasts, had not done as much harm\nas they had planned.\n\nBy the time that the miners had dug down some four feet, sending\nup the dirt in the hoist-tub, they came to the opening of the\ntunnel.  Thus encouraged, they worked faster than ever, until\na new shift was sent down the repaired ladders to relieve them.\n\nBy daylight the men, changing every two hours for fresher details,\nwere well into the tunnel.\n\nHere, for some yards, the tunnel was somewhat choked.  After this\nsemi-obstruction had been cleared away, Tom Reade was able to\nlead his men for some distance down the tunnel.  Then they came\nupon the scene of the late big blast.\n\nHere the rock had been hurled about in masses.  A scene of apparent\nwreck met the eyes of the miners and their leader, though even\nhere the damage was not as great as had been expected by Gage\nand his rascals.\n\nTo the north of the tunnel lay a great, gaping, jagged tear in\nthe wall of rock.  This tear, or hole, extended some ten feet\nto the north of the tunnel proper.\n\nAs Tom entered, a glint caught his eye.  Something in the aspect\nof that dull illumination, reflected back to him, made his pulses\nleap.\n\nHe passed his left hand over his eyes, wondering if he were dreaming.\n\n\"I---I can't believe it!\" he stammered.  \"Look, boys, and tell\nme what you see!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\"It's the gleam of the real metal in the rock, sir---what's what\nit is,\" gasped one of the miners, as he held up a lantern to aid\nhim in his quest.\n\nIt lay there, in streaks and rifts, a dull gleaming here and there.\nTo be sure, it was nothing at all like a solid golden wall, but\nTom Reade could be contented with less than Golconda.\n\nIn spots the precious metal showed in darkish streaks, instead\nof yellow.  But these dark streaks showed admixtures of silver.\n\n\"Run and get me a hammer, one of you,\" cried Tom, breathing fast.\n\nWhen the miner returned with the chisel-nosed hammer he found\nthe young engineer eagerly exploring the whole length of the new\nwall thus laid bare.\n\n\"I knew that a real vein lay here,\" Tom went on, as he took the\nhammer.  \"The only trouble with us, men, was that we were working\neight or ten feet south of where the true vein lay.  Now, by the\ngreat Custer, we've hit it---thanks to the enemy!\"\n\nEagerly Tom chipped off specimens of the rich gold and silver\nbearing rock.  He loaded down two men and carried more himself.\nEvery piece of rock was a specimen of rich ore.\n\nUp the shaft they went, emerging into the sunlight.\n\n\"I'd like to know who the scamps were that fired the blasts in\nthe mine,\" Tom muttered joyously.  \"I'd like to reward them.\"\n\n\"Party coming, sir,\" reported a miner, pointing to the southward.\n\nOver the snow came a cutter, drawn by two horses, slipping fast\nover the snow.  From one side of the cutter a pair of skis hung\noutward.\n\n\"That's Jim Ferrers and the doctor from Dugout,\" Tom breathed.\n\"But who can the other lot of people be.\"\n\nA pung, drawn also by a pair of horses, contained five men.\n\nJim was quickly on hand to explain matters.\n\n\"I've brought Dr. Scott.  He'll have to see Hazelton quickly, and\nthen get back to Dugout,\" Jim declared.  \"The doctor is afraid the\ncrust may melt, and then he'll be stalled here with his outfit.\n\n\"Those men over there?\" inquired Reade, as the pung stopped, and\nthe five men got out \"Two of them look familiar to me.\"\n\n\"I reckon,\" nodded Jim Ferrers.  \"They're officers---all of 'em.\nThey've come over here to hunt the rocks to the south of here.\nUp at the jail the keepers worried out of Eb some information\nabout a cave where Dolph Gage hangs out.  It seems that Gage and\nhis pals have been stealing supplies at the Bright Hope Mine.\"\n\nJim introduced Dr. Scott, who said:\n\n\"I must see my patient and be away in an hour.  I don't want to\nget stalled here by a thaw.\"\n\nSo Tom led the way to the shack, and did not see the departure of\nthe law's five officers.\n\nOutside Reade carefully dropped the ore he had brought along and\nmade a sign to his workmen to do the same.  Then the partners\nand the physician went inside.\n\nTom watched closely while the physician placed a thermometer in\nHarry's mouth and felt his pulse.  Respiration was also counted,\nafter which Dr. Scott produced a stethoscope and listened at Harry's\nchest and back.  A little more, and the examination was completed.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" announced Dr. Scott, \"you've brought me all this\ndistance over the snow-crust to see a patient who is just about\nconvalescent.  This young man may have some nourishment today,\nand by day after tomorrow he will be calling loudly for the cook.\"\n\n\"What has been the trouble, doc?\" Hazelton asked.\n\n\"Congestion of the right lung, my son, but the congestion has\nalmost wholly disappeared.\"\n\nA mist came before Tom Reade's eyes.  Now that his chum was out\nof danger Reade realized how severe on him the whole ordeal had\nbeen.\n\nAs soon as Tom found a chance he asked Dr. Scott:\n\n\"Will a little excitement of the happiest kind hurt Hazelton any?\"\n\n\"Just what kind of excitement?\"\n\n\"We've had a disappointing mine that has turned over night into\na bonanza.  I've a lot of the finest specimens outside.\"\n\n\"Bring them in,\" directed the physician.\n\nTom came in with an armful.\n\n\"Harry,\" he called briskly, \"we were right in thinking we had\na rich vein.  The only trouble was that we were working eight\nor ten feet south of the real vein.  Look over these specimens.\"\n\nTom ranged half a dozen on the top blanket.  When Harry's glistening\neyes had looked them all over, Tom produced other specimens of\nore.  Dr. Scott examined them, too, with a critical eye.\n\n\"If you've got much of this stuff in your mine, Reade,\" said the\nmedical man, \"you won't need to work much longer.\"\n\n\"Won't need to work much longer?\" gasped Tom Reade.  \"Man alive,\nwe don't want to stop working.  When a man stops working he may\nas well consult the undertaker, for he's practically dead anyway.\nWhat we want gold for is so that we can go on working on a bigger\nscale than ever!  And now, Harry, the name for our mine has come\nto me.\"\n\n\"What are you going to call it?\" Hazelton asked.\n\n\"With your consent, and Ferrers's, we'll name it the Ambition\nMine.  That's just what the mine stands for with us, you know.\"\n\n\"The best name in the world,\" Harry declared.\n\n\"And now, young man,\" said Dr. Scott, addressing Hazelton, \"I\nwant you to rest quietly while Tim Walsh sponges you off and the\ncook is busy making some thin gruel for you.  Reade, in order\nto get you out of here I'll agree to go down in your mine with you.\"\n\nDr. Scott proved more than an interested spectator when he reached\nthe tunnel.  He possessed considerable knowledge of ores.\n\n\"Yes; you have your bonanza here, Reade,\" declared the physician.\n\"Almost any ambition that money will gratify will soon be yours.\nFrom the very appearance of this newly-opened vein I don't believe\nit is one that will give out in a hurry.\"\n\n\"By the way, Doe,\" called Ferrers, joining them, \"here's that\nnugget that you wouldn't take when I offered it to you in Dugout.\nYou've made your visit, and now the nugget is yours.\"\n\n\"I don't want it,\" smiled Dr. Scott.  \"I want real money, in place\nof the nugget, and I'll be content to wait for it.  The owners\nof this mine will be welcome to run up a very considerable bill\nwith me.\"\n\n\"Then can you stay a few days?\" queried Tom eagerly.  \"Until good\nold Harry is wholly out of danger.\"\n\n\"Yes; I'll stay a few days, if you wish it, Mr. Reade.\"\n\nFinally Jim had the presence of mind to pilot the physician to\nthe cook shack.\n\nQuietly enough the officers from Dugout had reentered camp.  With\nthem they had borne one long, covered object---the remains of\nDolph Gage, who had been shot and killed while resisting arrest.\nGage's two remaining companions had been brought in, handcuffed.\nThese expert sheriff's officers from Dugout had been able to\nfind a trail, even on the hard-frozen snow crust, and had tracked\nthe criminals directly to their cave.\n\nJim Ferrers went over to where the body of Gage lay on the snow.\nGently he turned down the cloth that covered the dead man's face.\nFor a few moments Ferrers gazed at the still face; then, awkwardly,\nafter hesitating, he lifted his hat from his head.\n\n\"That man killed your brother, Jim,\" murmured Tom, stepping up\nto his Nevada partner.  \"You had other reasons for hating him.\nIn the old days you would have run Dolph Gage down and killed\nhim yourself.  In these newer days you have left Gage to the hands\nof the law.  It is a much better way, and you will never even have\nto wonder whether you have done any wrong.\"\n\n\"The law's way is always best, I reckon,\" returned Jim Ferrers,\nslowly.\n\nThat same day, after the officers had gone with their men, Jim\nFerrers, finding that the crust was holding, drove fresh horses\nto the doctor's cutter.  The physician remained behind to take\ncare of Harry Hazelton, but Jim went fast toward Dugout City.\nHe was armed with letters from Dr. Scott that told certain dealers\nin Dugout what unlimited credit the partners ought to have on\naccount of their mine.\n\nBefore Harry was sitting up vehicles had been employed to bring\nto Ambition Mine considerable supplies of dynamite, food and all\nelse that was needed, including half a dozen of the latest books\nfor the amusement of the invalid engineer.\n\nEverything went on swiftly now.  More miners, too, were brought\nover, while the hard crust lasted, and a score of carpenters.\nLumber camp also.  There was a constant procession of vehicles\nbetween Dugout and Ambition Mine.  Tom did not hesitate to avail\nhimself of his sudden credit, for every day's work showed that\nthe vein was not giving out.  An ore dump was piling up that meant\nbig returns when the ore could be hauled to the smelter.\n\nAmbition Mine proved a steady \"payer.\"  No; our young men did\nnot become multi-millionaires.  Mines that will do that for three\npartners are scarce, indeed.  Ambition, however, did pay enough\nso that, by spring, Tom and Harry, after looking over their bank\naccount, found that they could go ahead and furnish their engineer\noffices on a handsome scale.  Some thousands, too, found their\nway to their families in the good old home town of Gridley.\n\nThe mine was turned into a stock company.  Tom, Harry and Jim\neach retained one-fourth interest.  The remaining fourth of the\nstock was divided evenly between Cook Leon and the twenty-four\nminers who had stood by so loyally, so that now each of the original\nminers, in addition to his day's pay, owned one per cent. of the\ngold and silver that went up in the new elevator that replaced\nthe tub-hoist.\n\nAlf Drew did not receive one of the small shares in the mine property.\nHis cigarette smoking had made him lazy and worthless, and he had\ndone nothing to promote the success of the once desperate\nmining venture.\n\nHowever, there was hope for Alf.  At the time when he threw his\nremaining \"coffin nails\" in the cook's fire he really did \"swear\noff,\" and he afterwards was able to refrain from the use of tobacco\nin any form.  He grew taller and stouter and developed his muscles.\nTom and Harry employed him at the mine as a checking clerk, where\nhe actually earned his money, and saved a goodly amount of it\nevery month.\n\n\"Tom, you rascal, you promised some day to show me how you scared\nthat boy stiff with your rattlesnake click,\" Harry reminded his\npartner.\n\n\"Nothing very difficult about it,\" laughed Tom.  \"Can you make\na noise by grinding your molars together---your grinding teeth?\nTry it.\"\n\nHarry did.  The noise came forth from his mouth, though it didn't\nsound exactly like the rattle of a rattler.\n\n\"Keep on practicing, and you'll get that rattle down to\nperfection---that's all,\" nodded Tom.\n\nSpring found the young engineers restless for new fields.  They\nlonged to tackle other big feats of engineering.  Jim Ferrers\nunderstood, and said to them:\n\n\"You youngsters know, now, that you can trust me to run this mine.\"\n\n\"We always knew that we could trust you,\" Tom corrected him.\n\n\"Well, you know it now, anyway.  You want to get back into the\nworld.  You are restless for new fields to conquer.  Go ahead;\nonly come back once in a while and shake hands with old Jim.\nWhile you're away I'll send you a monthly statement of your earnings\nand see that the money is placed to your credit.\"\n\nOn their ride to Dugout, Tom and Harry were favored with the company\nof Mr. Dunlop, promoter of the Bright Hope Mine.\n\n\"I suppose it's a lucky thing for you boys that you stuck to your\nown mine,\" said Dunlop.  \"you've come out a good deal better.\nI wish I had secured your services, though.  We're making some\nmoney over at the Bright Hope, but we'd make a lot more with the\nright engineers in charge.  I'm on my way to Dugout to use the\ntelegraph wires in earnest.  I've learned that the real way to\nmake money out of a mine is to have a real engineer in charge.\"\n\nTom and Harry delayed but a couple of hours at Dugout.  Then-----\n\nHowever, their further adventures must be delayed in the narration\nuntil they appear between the covers of the next volume in this\nseries.  It will be published at once under the title, \"_The Young\nEngineers In Mexico; Or, Fighting the Mine Swindlers_.\"\n\nIn this new volume will be described what Tom and Harry did in\na land of mystery and romance; a land where the sharp contrasts\nof wealth and squalor have fostered the development of many noble\ncharacters and have created some of the vilest among men.  The\nforthcoming story is one filled with the glamour and the fascination\nof that neighbor-country of hot-blooded men.  In Mexico, Tom and\nHarry encountered their most startling adventures of all.",

XXI.--THE AVERAGE UNDERGRADUATE.\n\nThose who live much in the society of the very middle-aged, hear from\nthem loud and frequent complaints of the decay of courtesy and the\ngeneral deterioration, both of manners and of habits, observable in\nthe young men of the day. With many portentous shakings of the head,\nthese grizzling censors inform those who care to listen to their\nwailings, that in the time of their own youth it was understood to\nbe the duty of young men to be modest, considerate, generous in their\ntreatment of one another, and chivalrous in their behaviour to women.\nAnd every one of them will probably suggest to his hearers that he was\nintimately acquainted with at least one young man who fulfilled that\nduty with a completeness and a perfection never since attained. Now,\nhowever, they will declare, the case is different. Young men have\nbecome selfish and arrogant. Their respect for age has vanished,\ntheir behaviour to ladies is familiar and flippant, their style of\nconversation is slangy and disreputable, they are wanting in all\nproper reverence, they are pampered, luxurious, affected, foolish, and\ndisingenuous; unworthy, in short, to be mentioned in the same breath\nwith those who have preceded them, and have left to their degenerate\nsuccessors a brilliant but unavailing example of youthful conduct.\nThese diatribes may or may not be founded to some extent in truth.\nAt the best, however, their truth is only a half-truth. So long as\nthe world endures, it is probable that young men will have a large\nallowance of follies, of affectations, of extravagances, and the young\nmen of to-day are certainly not without them. But, in the main, though\nthe task of comparison is difficult, they do not appear to be at all\ninferior in manliness, in modesty of bearing, and in reverence to the\ngenerations that have gone before. Here and there in London the antics\nof some youth plunged into a torrent of folly before he had had time\neven to think of being wise, excite the comments of the world. But\nLondon is not the school to which one would look for youth at its\nbest. To find that in any considerable quantity one must travel either\nto Cambridge or to Oxford, and inspect the average undergraduates, who\nform the vast majority at both these Universities.\n\nNow the Average Undergraduate, as he exists, and has for ages existed,\nis not, perhaps, a very wise young man. Nor does he possess those\nbrilliant qualities which bring the Precocious Undergraduate to\npremature ruin. He has his follies, but they are not very foolish; he\nhas his affectations, but they are innocent; he has his extravagances,\nbut they pass away, and leave him not very much the worse for the\nexperience. On the whole, however, he is a fine specimen of the young\nEnglishman--brave, manly, loyal, and upright. He is the salt of his\nUniversity, and an honour to the country that produces him.\n\nThe Average Undergraduate will have been an average schoolboy, not\nafflicted with too great a love of classics or mathematics, and\ngifted, unfortunately, with a fine contempt for modern languages. But\nhe will have taken an honourable part in all school-games, and will\nhave acquired through them not only vigorous health and strength,\nbut that tolerant and generous spirit of forbearance without which no\nmanly game can be carried on. These qualities he will carry with him\nto the University which his father chooses for him, and to which he\nhimself looks forward rather as a home of liberty slightly tempered by\nProctors, than as a temple of learning, moderated by examiners.\n\nDuring the October term which makes him a freshman, the Average\nUndergraduate devotes a considerable time to mastering the etiquette\nof his University and College. He learns that it is not customary to\nshake hands with his friends more than twice in each term, once at\nthe beginning, and again at the end of the term. If he is a Cambridge\nman, he will cut the tassel of his academical cap short; at Oxford\nhe will leave it long; but at both he will discover that sugar-tongs\nare never used, and that the race of Dons exists merely to plague him\nand his fellows with lectures, to which he pays small attention, with\nenforced chapels, which he sometimes dares to cut, and, with general\ndisciplinary regulations, to which he considers it advisable to\nsubmit, though he is never inclined to admit their necessity. He\nbecomes a member of his college boat-club, and learns that one of\nthe objects of a regular attendance at College Chapel is, to enable\nthe freshman to practise keeping his back straight. Similarly, Latin\nDictionaries and Greek Lexicons are, necessarily, bulky, since,\notherwise, they would be useless as seats on which the budding oarsman\nmay improve the length of his swing in the privacy of his own rooms.\nThese rooms are all furnished on the same pattern. A table, a pedestal\ndesk for writing, half-a-dozen ordinary chairs, a basket arm-chair,\nperhaps a sofa, some photographs of school-groups, family photographs\nin frames, a cup or two, won at the school athletic sports, a football\ncap, and a few prints of popular pictures, complete the furniture and\ndecorations of the average College rooms. Of course there are, even\namongst undergraduates, wealthy æsthetes, who furnish their rooms\nextravagantly--but the Average Undergraduate is not one of them.\n\nOn the fifth of November the freshman sallies forth only to find,\nwith a sense of bitter disappointment, that the rows between Town and\nGown are things of the past. He will have discovered ere this that\nundergraduate etiquette has ordained that while he wears a cap and\ngown he must forswear gloves, and leave his umbrella at home, even\nthough the rain should pour down in torrents. All these ordinances he\nobserves strictly, though he can neither be \"hauled\" nor \"gated\" for\nsetting them at defiance. Towards the end of his first term he begins\nto realise more accurately the joys and privileges of University life,\nhe has formed his set, and more or less found his level, he has become\na connoisseur of cheap wine, he has with pain and labour learned to\nsmoke, he has certainly exceeded his allowance, and he returns to his\nhome with the firm conviction that he knows a great deal of life. He\nwill terrify his mother with tales of proctorial misadventures, and\nwill excite the suspicions of his father by the new brilliance of his\nattire. Indeed it is a curious fact that whatever the special pursuit\nof the Average Undergraduate may be, and whatever may be the calling\nand profession of his father, the two are generally engaged in a\nfinancial war. This always ends in the triumph of the older man, who\nnever scruples to use the power which the possession of the purse\ngives him in order to discomfit his son. From a University point of\nview, the average father has as little variety as the average son.\n\nIt must be noted that away from the University or his family circle,\nand in the society of ladies, the Average Undergraduate is shy.\nThe wit that flashed so brilliantly in the College Debating Club\nis extinguished, the stream of humour that flowed amidst shouts\nof laughter in the Essay Society is frozen at its source, the\nconversation that delighted the frequenters of his rooms is turned\ninto an irresponsive mumble. But as soon as he returns to the academic\ngroves, and knows that petticoats are absent, and that his own\nbeloved \"blazer\" is on his back, Richard is himself again. He has his\nundergraduate heroes whom he worships blindly, hoping himself to be\nsome day a hero and worthy of worship. Moreover, there are in every\nCollege traditions which cause the undergraduate who is a member of it\nto believe that the men of that particular society are finer fellows\nthan the men of any other. These traditions the Average Undergraduate\nholds as though they were articles of his religion.\n\nThe Average Undergraduate generally takes a respectable position\nas a College oarsman or cricketer, though he may fail to attain to\nthe University Eight or to the Eleven. He passes his examinations\nwith effort, but still he passes them. He recks not of Honours. The\n\"poll\" or the pass contents him. Sometimes he makes too much noise,\noccasionally he dines too well. In London, too, his conduct during\nvacations is perhaps a little exuberant, and he is often inclined to\ntreat the promenades at the Leicester Square Variety Palaces as though\nhe had purchased them. But, on the whole, he does but little harm\nto himself and others. He is truthful and ingenuous, and although he\nknows himself to be a man, he never tries to be a very old or a very\nwicked one. In a word, he is wholesome. In the end he takes his degree\ncreditably enough. His years at the University have been years of pure\ndelight to him, and he will always look back to them as the happiest\nof his life. He has not become very learned, but he will always be a\nuseful member of the community, and whether as barrister, clergyman,\ncountry gentleman, or business man, he will show an example of manly\nuprightness which his countrymen could ill afford to lose.\n\nFINIS.--The last nights on earth at the Haymarket are announced of\n_A Village Priest_. May he rest in piece. The play that immediately\nfollows is, _Called Back_; naturally enough a revival, as the title\nimplies. But one thing is absolutely certain, and that is, that\n_A Village Priest_ will never be _Called Back_. Perhaps _L'Abbé\nConstantin_ may now have a chance. Eminently good, but not absolutely\nsaintly. Is there any chance of the _Abbé_ being \"translated?\"\n\n[Illustration: THE SMELLS.\n\n(_EDGAR ALLAN POE \"UP TO DATE.\"_)]\n\n  I.\n\n    Look on London with its Smells--\n      Sickening Smells!\n  What long nasal misery their nastiness foretells!\n    How they trickle, trickle, trickle,\n    On the air by day and night!\n  While our thoraxes they tickle.\n  Like the fumes from brass in pickle,\n   Or from naphtha all alight;\n  Making stench, stench, stench,\n  In a worse than witch-broth drench,\n  Of the muck-malodoration that so nauseously wells\n    From the Smells, Smells, Smells, Smells,\n      Smells, Smells, Smells--\n  From the fuming and the spuming of the Smells.\n\n  II.\n\n    Sniff the fetid sewer Smells--\n      Loathsome Smells!\n  What a lot of typhoid their intensity foretells!\n  Through the pleasant air of night,\n    How they spread, a noxious blight!\n    Full of bad bacterian motes,\n      Quickening soon.\n  What a lethal vapour floats\n  To the foul Smell-fiend who glistens as he gloats\n      On the boon.\n    Oh, from subterranean cells\n  What a gush of sewer-gas voluminously wells!\n      How it swells!\n      How it dwells\n    In our houses!

Its advent\n    was announced by a flash of light which illuminated the whole\n    city. A long fiery streak marked its course, and remained\n    visible for more than a minute. At first this streak was\n    perfectly straight, but, after it had begun to fade, it broke\n    into a zig-zag.\"\n\nThe phenomenon so graphically described, though remarkable, is not,\nwe believe, in the circumstances, entirely novel. Perhaps it is\nnoteworthy as coming a little early in the year. We understand that\non New Year's Day, \"those who are out of doors in Edinburgh at three\no'clock in the morning,\" are not unfrequently startled in somewhat\nsimilar manner.\n\nTHE TOOTHERIES.--\"TOOTH's Gallery\" always strikes as a somewhat\nmisleading appellation. It always appears to have more to do with\npalates than pictures, and to be more concerned with gums than gold\nframes. No doubt the head of the firm of Messrs. ARTHUR TOOTH AND SONS\nis a wise TOOTH, so let him christen his gallery the \"Arthurnæum.\" He\nis a TOOTH that you can_not_ stop, he is always coming out, and this\nautumn he comes out stronger than ever with a most interesting and\nvaried collection. Excellent examples you may find of J.B. BURGESS,\nJ.C. HOOK, BASTIEN LEPAGE, TADEMA, VICAT COLE, PETER GRAHAM, MILLAIS,\nLEADER, C.

Toasts in plenty: music of course. But why\nwas there absent from the harmonious list so appropriate a glee as Sir\nHenry Bishop's:--\n\n  \"Uprouse ye then,\n  My merry merry men,\n  It is our opening day!\"\n\nWhy wasn't Deputy-Sheriff BEARD asked?

She said, \"My lamb\n    Has wool as white as snow;\n  But packed in ice? It don't sound nice,\n    No, Sydney Merchant, No!\n\n  \"Refrigerate my darling! Oh!\n    It makes my bosom bleed.\n  Still, go it must. I think you said,\n    'Delivery guaranteed!'\"\n\n  So Mary's lamb the ocean crossed\n    By \"Frozen Parcel Post;\"\n  And Mary's Cousin said its chops\n    Were most delicious--_most_!\n\n  MORAL.\n\n  Science, though it pays \"cent. per cent.,\"\n    Is destitute of pity;\n  And makes hash of the sentiment\n    Dear to the Nursery ditty.\n\nROBERT AS HUMPIRE.\n\nI was a takin of my favrit walk, larst Friday was a week, from Charing\nCross round to my own privet residence in Queen street, when a yung\nlad tapped me on the sholder and said to me, \"Please, Sir, are you the\nsillybrated Mr. ROBERT, the Citty Waiter?\" In course I replied, \"Yes,\nmost suttenly;\" when he said, \"Then this yere letter's for you, and\nI wants a emediat arnser.\" Concealing my wisibel estonishment, I took\nhim hup Healy Place, where the werry famous Lawyer lives, as can git\nyou out of any amownt of trubbel, and then opened the letter, and read\nthe following most estonishing words, wiz.:--\"Mr. ROBERT,--can you\ncome _immediately_ to the ---- Club, as you alone can decide a very\nheavy wager that is now pending between two Noble Lords who are here\nawaiting your arrival. You will be well paid for your trouble. The\nBearer will show you the way.--J.N.\" I coud learn nothink from my\njewwenile guide, so I told him to lead the way, and off we started,\nand soon arived at the Club.\n\nI need ardly say that, being all quite fust-rate swells, they receaved\nme in the most kindest manner, and ewen smiled upon me most freely,\nwhich in course I felt as a great complement.\n\nOne on 'em then adrest me sumwot as follers, \"I'm sure, Mr. ROBERT,\nwe are all werry much obliged to you for coming so reddily at my\nrequest.\" At which they all cried, \"Here! here!\" \"You of coarse\nunderstand what we wish you to do.\" To which I at once replide, \"Quite\nso, my noble swells.\" At which they all larfed quite lowd, tho' I'm\nsure I don't kno why. He then said that it was thort better not to\nmenshun the names of any of the Gents present, and he then presented\nme with a little packet, which he requested I woud not open till I got\nhome, and then proseeded to xplain the Wager, somthink like this. Two\nof the noble Lords present, it apeared, had disagreed upon a certain\nmatter, and, wanting a Humpire of caracter and xperience to decide\nbetween them, had both agreed to a surgestion that had bin made, that\nof all the many men in London none coudn't be considered more fitter\nfor the post than Mr. ROBERT, the sillybrated Citty Waiter!\n\nI rayther thinks as I blusht wisibly, and I knos as I bust out into\na perfuse prusperashun, but I didn't say a word, but pulled myself\ntogether as I can ginerally do when I feels as it's necessary to\nmanetane my good charackter. He then said, \"The question for you to\ndeside is this: At a great and most himportant Dinner that is about\nto be held soon, at which most of the werry grandest swells left in\nLundon will be present, we intends to hinterduce 'The Loving Cup;'\nnot,\" he added, smiling, \"so much to estonish the natives, as to\nstagger the strangers. The question, therefore, that you, as the\nleading Citty Waiter of the day, have to settle, is, How many of the\nGests stand up while one on 'em drinks?\" Delighted to find how heasy\nwas my tarsk, I ansers, without a moment's hezzitation, \"Three!\" One\non 'em turned garstly pale, and shouted out, \"What for?\" To which I\nreplied, \"One to take off and hold up the cover, the second to bow,\nand drink out of the Cup, and the third to protect the Drinker while\nhe drinks, lest any ennemy should stab him in the back.\"\n\nThe garstly pale Gent wanted to arsk more questions, but the rest\nshouted, \"Horder! Horder!\" and the fust Gent coming up to me again,\nthanked me for what he called my kindness in cumming, so I made 'em my\nvery best bow, which I copied from a certain Poplar Prince, and took\nmy departure.\n\nBeing, I hopes, a man of strict werassity, I never wunce took ewen\nso much as a peep at the little packet as the Gent gave me, but I\ncouldn't help feeling ewery now and then to see if it was quite safe,\nwhich of course it was, and ewen when I reached my umbel abode, I\nstill restrained my natral curiossity, and sat down, and told my\nwundrus tail to the wife of my buzzom, and then placed the little\npacket in her estonished ands, which she hopened with a slite flutter,\nand then perdoosed from it _Five Golden Souverings!_ If any other\nnoble swells wants another Humpire on the same libberal terms, let 'em\nsend to ROBERT.\n\n[Illustration: PHILOMELA AND AQUILA.\n\n[It is stated that Madame PATTI presented Mr. GLADSTONE with a box of\nvoice lozenges.]\n\n  PATTI, take, PATTI, take, Grand Old Man!\n  Give him voice lozenges soon as you can.\n  Pack them, address them, as neat as can be,\n  And courteously hand them to W.G.!\n\n  Mellifluous Nightingale, melody's source\n  Our Golden (mouthed) Eagle hath grown a bit hoarse;\n  But though Aquila's husky with age and long fights,\n  His sweet Philomela will set him to-rights.\n\n  A cough-drop, a lozenge, a jube-jube, from _you_,\n  His larynx will strengthen and lubricate too.\n  His old \"_Camp Town Races_\" he'll pipe again yet;\n  Nay--who knows?--with you may arrange a duet!\n\n  The eagle is scarcely a song-bird, but still,\n  He may have a good ear for the nightingale's trill!\n  Fair Philomel comes to old Aquila's aid!!!\n  Faith! the picture is pretty, so here 'tis portrayed?\n]\n\n[Illustration: CLEOPATRA IN PARIS.

Mr. COMPTON doesn't wish to \"make your flesh creep\" like the Fat\nBoy in _Pickwick_. It is only the story of a tea-planter's romance,\nthough the finding of the gift is most exciting. Interesting and well\nwritten.\n\n_The Cabinet Portrait Gallery_, published by CASSELL & Co., with\nportraits of most of our Celebrities, by Messrs.

BLACKIE & SON.\n\"Among the names,\" says the Baron's juvenile assistant Co. Junior,\n\"we recognise one of our boys' most favourite authors, G.A. HENTY, who\nthis year gives them another exciting historical tale, _By England's\nAid_, which deals with the closing events of the War of Independence\nin Holland. Also _Maori and Settler_, a story of the New Zealand\nWar, when young England was quite a settler for the Maori. Both\nrecommended. _Hal Hungerford_, by J.R. HUTCHINSON, is a good book for\nboys, and _A Rash Promise, or, Meg's Secret_ by CECILIA SELBY LOWNDES,\nis an equally good one for girls, and finally _The Girls' Own Paper\nAnnual_, and _The Boys' Own Paper Annual_, are two very handsome\ncapitally illustrated gift-books.\" Now the Baron's cheerful assistants\nhave done their work, he himself, has something to say.\n\n\"No, my dear and venerable Mr. T.

He never was.

No matter.\nYour health, and book!\"\n\n[Illustration: A Cigarette-Maker's Romance.]\n\nPermit the Baron to strongly recommend MARION CRAWFORD's _A\nCigarette-Maker's Romance_. Slight indeed is the plot, and few the\n_dramatis personæ_: but the latter are drawn with a Meissonier-like\nfinish, and the simple tale is charmingly and touchingly told. The\nwonder of it is that so little to tell should have occupied two\nvolumes; and a greater wonder remains, which is, that, at the close,\nthe reader should wish there were a third. To create this desire\nis, after all, the very perfection of the art of novel-writing. The\nnovelist who does not make the reader \"wish as there was more on it,\"\naccording to the philosophic _dictum_ of _Sam Weller_ on the art of\nepistolary correspondence, has failed. Henceforth this novel of Mr.\nCRAWFORD's goes forth to the world with the Baron's best _imprimatur_.\nThis poor little cigarette-maker requires no puffing of her wares.\nEnough that the Baron should say to his readers, \"_Tolle lege!_\" You\nwill be delighted with it, \"_Il cigaretto per esser felice_.\" It is a\ncharming story, says emphatically,\n\nTHE BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.\n\nHOPE FOR THE EAST END OF LONDON UNDER THE NEW MAYORALTY.--If South\nKensington and the Fashionable West are now complaining of smells\neverywhere in the S. and S.W. district, the City and the East End may,\nfor one year at least, rejoice in the supreme rule of the Savory. We\ncan't write of SAVORY without adding MOORE, so we must mention that\nthe name of SAVORY is ominous for the continuation of the Mayoralty.\nThe Guildhall Banquets end with a Savory. _Absit omen!_\n\nWINTER OPERA.\n\n[Illustration: Our Maggie McIntyre as \"La (Prima) Donna del 'Lago.'\"]\n\nRoyal Italian Opera is quite a winter rose in Covent Garden. It\nblossomed well, and is doing bloomingly. How lovely and of what happy\nomen is the name of MARIA PERI, whose _Valentina_ in _Les Huguenots_\nis worth recording, even though it does not beat the record. It is\nsaid to be an uninteresting part, yet I remember everybody being\nuncommonly enthusiastic about this same _Valentina_ when GRISI played\nit, and _her_ \"Valentine\" was _Romeo_-like MARIO. Their struggle, his\nLeap for Life out of the window after the great \"_Tu M'ami_\" solo and\nduet, her despair, will never be forgotten. \"Nothing in the part,\"\nquotha! Nothing in the person more likely. Signor PADILLA, excellent\nactor, is here again.

From\nthe general demeanour and appearance of the Chorus of \"Ladies and\nKnights,\" and \"Friends of Lord ASHTON,\" the ASHTONS evidently in a\nvery second-rate set at Lammermoor. However, it must be admitted that\ntheir attitude, as spectators of _Lucia's_ delirium, left nothing to\ndesire on the score of repose--the VERE DE VERES themselves could\nnot have been calmer, or less concerned.

You begin your dinner. Take twice, thrice, or, even four times of\nevery course, glaring savagely and defiantly at your neighbour as you\npass the dish.

At least, this is how\nthe German element--a very formidable one at the Hôtel Titlis--for\nthe most part, conducted itself over the principal meal of the day.\nThere were, of course, exceptions, for all Germany is not essentially\nGerman; yet it must be confessed that the prevailing features were\nof this guzzling, and, for the want of a more descriptive word, I\nwould add, \"sweltering\" type, not fully appreciated by the ordinary\ntravelling Briton, who, whatever else he may be, is not a gross\nfeeder, though he does set the proper value on a breath of pure fresh\nair.\n\n\"Get him up? Of course we can get him up,\" rejoined Dr. MELCHISIDEC,\nwarmly.

'Having,' he says, 'severed a wasp in two\n    pieces, I found that the head and thorax with the uninjured\n    wings retained full vitality.... It tried to fly, but\n    evidently lacked the necessary balance through the loss of the\n    abdomen. To test the matter further, I cut out an artificial\n    tail from a piece of thin cardboard, as nearly following the\n    shape of the natural body as possible. To fasten the appendage\n    to the wasp, I used a little oxgall ...; gum or more sticky\n    substances would not do, as it impedes the use of the wings\n    in flight. Presently the operation was complete, and, to my\n    surprise, the wasp, after one or two ineffectual efforts, flew\n    in rather lopsided fashion to the window. It then buzzed about\n    for at least a quarter of an hour, eventually flying out at\n    the top ... it was vigorous when it flew away.\"--_Extract from\n    an Evening Paper._\n\n  The Benefit of Humour in    Philosophers can always do more\n  Philosophy.

Hypocrisy wears a venerable look;\nand relies on its mask to hide its stupidity and fear.\" Now this was\nrather rough on the Bard, who is described as \"an interesting figure,\nwith his long white hair falling over his shoulders.\" It seemed as if\nROBERT INGERSOLL wished to imply, Don't be taken in and accept W.W.\nat his own poetic valuation as a poet, simply because he is wrinkled,\nold, white-haired, and wears a venerable look, which, after all, may\nbe only a hypocritical mask? Mr. INGERSOLL couldn't have been more\ninfelicitous if he had \"come to bury 'WHITMAN,' not to praise him.\"\nThen he went on, \"Neither does WHITMAN accept everything new.\" This\nclearly excepted the testimonial, which, we may suppose, was brand\nnew, or at all events, had been so at some time or other, though\nhaving been \"long contemplated\" it might have got a trifle dusty or\nmouldy. Then finished the orator, magnificently, epigrammatically, and\nemphatically, thus \"He\" (i.e., WALT WHITMAN) \"wants truth.\" And with\nall our heart and soul we reply, \"We wish he may get it.\"\n\nMR. PUNCH'S PRIZE NOVELS.--No. V., \"_Mignon's Mess-Room_,\" will appear\nin our next Number.\n\nEMPLOYMENT OF CAPITAL.\n\nSir,--In the _St. James's Gazette_ of Thursday week there was a\nquotation from Mr. BUCHANAN's _Modern Review_, where, in support of\nhis opinions, he quotes \"_Pope passim_.\" Whatever may be the outward\nand visible form of Mr. BUCHANAN's religion, it is discourteous, at\nleast, even for an ultra-Presbyterian Scotchman, to spell the name of\na Pope without making the initial letter a capital, and it is unlike\na Scotchman not to make capital out of anything. Here, I may say, that\nMr. BUCHANAN's contributions to recent journalistic literature have\nbeen mostly capital letters. But to return. Why POPE _passim_, and\nnot POPE _Passim_, or POPE PASSIM? Is it not mis-spelt? In vain have I\nsearched history for the name of this Pope. _Searchimus iterum_. But\nI must protest, in the mean time, of this particularly mean way of\nBu-chananising a Roman Pontiff. Please accept this as a MEMO FROM\nNEMO.\n\nSOMETHING IN A NAME.--\"MOIR TOD STORMOUTH DARLING\" (any other\nnames?) \"Esq., Advocate, Q.C., H.M.'s Solicitor-General for\nScotland\"--phew!--a good mouthful all this, almost as great as \"JOHN\nRICHARD THOMAS ALEXANDER DWYER,\" of _Rejected Addresses_--has been\nelevated to the Scottish Judicial Bench. Good. The MOIR the Merrier!\nTOD is the first half of Tod-dy which is the foundation of whiskey.\nYour health, More Toddy! STOR-MOUTH is as good a mouth as any other,\nwhatever mouth may be chosen to store away more Toddy. And finally,\n\"DARLING\" is a term sometimes lawful, rarely legal, of endearment, and\nhenceforth in Scotland STORMOUTH not \"CHARLIE\" is \"our DARLING, our\ngay Cavalier!\"\n\nIN OUR GARDEN.\n\n[Illustration: Illuminated 'A']\n\nA very odd thing. Just as we had got into Our Garden, were, so to\nspeak, turning up our sleeves to hoe and dig, I have been called\naway. It is Mr. G. who has done it. The other day the Member for Sark\nand I were out weeding the walk--at least he was weeding, and I was\nremarking to him on the healthfulness of out-door occupation, more\nespecially when pursued on the knees. Up comes the gardener with\nsomething on a pitchfork. Thought at first it was a new development of\nthe polyanthus. (We are always growing strange things. The Member for\nSark says, \"In Our Garden it is the unexpected that happens.\") Turned\nout to be a post-card. Our gardener is very careful to keep up our\nnew character. If the missive had been brought to us in the house, of\ncourse it would have been served up on a plate. In the garden it is\nappropriately handed about on a pitch-fork.\n\n\"My dear TOBY\" (this is the post-card), \"I'm just going up to\nEdinburgh; another Midlothian Campaign; You have been with me every\ntime; don't desert me now; have something quite new and original to\nsay on the Irish Question; would like you to hear it. Perhaps you\nnever heard of Mitchelstown? Been looking up particulars. Mean to\ntell the whole story. Will be nice and fresh; come quite a shock on\nBALFOUR. Don't fail; Yours ever, W.E.G.\"\n\nDidn't fail, and here I am, not in Our Garden, but in Edinburgh. Left\nthe Member for Sark in charge. A little uneasy; never know from day\nto day what his well-meant but ill-directed energy may not achieve.\nAt least the celery will be safe. One day, after I had worn myself out\nwith watching gardener dig trench, Sark came along, and in our absence\nfilled it up. Said it looked untidy to have long hole like that\nin respectable garden. Supposed we had been laying a drain; quite\nsurprised we weren't pleased, when he gleefully announced he had\nfilled it up.\n\nJust come back from great meeting in Corn Exchange. Difficult to\nrealise that it's eleven years since Mr. G. here in first campaign.\nA great deal happened in meantime, but enthusiasm just the same.\nMr. G. I suppose a trifle older, but ROSEBERY still boyish-looking.\nProceedings opened with procession of Delegates presenting addresses\nto Mr. G. Excellently arranged; reflects great credit on PAT CAMPBELL.\n(Capital name that for manager of variety _troupe_.) Leading idea was\nto present imposing representation of Liberal Scotia doing homage\nto its great chief. PAT caught on at once. Engaged thirty stalwart\nmen: none of your seedy sandwich-board fellows; responsible-looking\nburghers of all ages and sizes. Got them together in room at left door\nof stage--I mean of platform; free breakfast; oatmeal cake; unstinted\nheather-honey and haddocks. Mr. G. seated in chair in very middle of\nstage, the place, you know, where great tragedians insist upon dying.\nPrompter's bell rings; Delegates file in, every man with what looks\nlike a red truncheon in right hand; advance slowly along front of\nstage till reach chair where Mr. G. sits, apparently buried in deep\nthought.\n\n\"What ho!\" he cries, looking up with a start.\n\n\"My liege,\" says the sandwich-board man--I mean the Delegate, \"I\nbring hither the address of the Possilpark, Lambhill, Dykehead,\nCamburnathen, Wishaw, Dalbeattie, Catrine, and Sorn Liberal and\nRadical Association. Will I read it?\"\n\n\"I think not,\" said ROSEBERY, quietly, but firmly, and the Delegate,\nhanding the red thing to Mr. G., passed on.\n\nMr. G. smiling and bowing; audience applauded; next man comes.\n_He's_ from the Duntocher, Faifley, Slamannan, Cockpen, Pennicuik,\nClackmannan, Carnoustie, Kirkintilloch, and Lenzie Junior Liberal\nAssociation. He also wants to read the Address, but is mercifully\nhustled off, and the line, ever emerging from L. of stage, crosses,\nand passes on. At other side, PAT CAMPBELL waiting; a little anxious\nlest anything should go wrong to spoil his carefully-devised plan. But\neverything went well.\n\n\"Get ye away now,\" PAT whispered in ear of the man from Possilpark,\n&c.\n\nPossilpark, &c., at the clue, darted round rear of stage; got round in\ngood time to L.; fell into line, and was ready to come on again. Same\nwith the rest. Immense success! At the end of first three-quarters\nof an hour, PAT CAMPBELL arranged a block; pressure of innumerable\nDelegates so great, doncha, couldn't move off the stage in time. This\ngave opportunity for two of the stoutest burghers to go through quick\nchange; reappeared, dressed in kilts. This fairly fetched down house.\n\n\"The interminable procession,\" as ROSEBERY slyly called it, might have\ngone on till now, so perfect were the arrangements. But there was some\ntalk of Mr. G. making a speech, and, at end of hour and fifty minutes\nthe last Delegate slowly crossed in front of delighted audience,\nhanded his red _bâton_ to Mr. G., who, though he had entered\nthoroughly into the fun of the thing, was beginning to look a little\nfagged, and the speaking began.\n\nThis was excellent, especially ROSEBERY's introduction of the\ntravelling Star; a model of terse, felicitous language. Only one hitch\nhere. Speaking of Mr. G.'s honoured age, he likened him to famous\nDoge of Venice, \"old DANDOLO.\" ROSEBERY very popular in Edinburgh. But\naudience didn't like this; something like groan of horror ran along\ncrowded benches.\n\n\"Nae, nae,\" said one old gentleman, momentarily taking his knees out\nof the small of my back, \"that winna do. 'Auld WULLIE' is weel enoo,\nbut to ca' a man Auld DANDOLO to his face gars me greet.\" (Often met\nwith this phrase in songs and Scotch novels: curious to see how it was\ndone; fancy, from what followed, it's Scotch for taking snuff.)\n\nBarring this slip, everything went well. GLADSTONE delightful. So\nfresh, so informing, and so instructive! Began with lucid account\nof Battle of Waterloo; lightly sketched the state of parties at the\nperiod of the Reform agitation in 1832; glanced in passing at the\nregrettable conflict between the Northern and Southern States of\nAmerica (\"sons of one mother\" as he pathetically put it); and so\nglided easily and naturally into a detailed account of the _mêlée_\nat Mitchelstown, which, as he incidentally mentioned, took place four\nyears and a half ago.\n\nAudience sat entranced. You might have heard a pin drop, if indeed\nyou wanted to. I wish the Member for Sark had been here to hear it.\nHe would have been much more usefully employed than in that hopeless\npursuit to which he has given himself up, the growing of the peelless\npotato. He'll never do it.\n\nCORNWALL IN BAKER STREET.--The worst of Cornwall is, it is so far\noff--indeed, it has hitherto been quite out of sight. Everything comes\nto him who knows how to wait. We waited, and Mr. JOHN HOLLINGSHEAD\nbrought Niagara to Westminster. We waited again, and Mr. ARTHUR VOKINS\nbrings Cornwall to Baker Street, and introduces us to a very clever\nyoung sea-scapist, Mr. A. WARNE-BROWNE--altogether a misnomer, for he\nisn't a worn brown at all, he is as fresh and bright and sharp as a\nnewly-minted sovereign. Go and look at his \"_Lizard and Stags_\"--he\nisn't an animal-painter, though the title looks like it--his\n\"_Breaking Weather_,\" his \"_Rain Veils_,\" his \"_Innis Head_,\" or\nany one of his thirty pictures, and say if you don't agree with _Mr.\nPunch_. The whole of them are so true to Nature, are so faithful\nin their wave-drawing, there is such a breeziness, such a saltness\npervades them throughout, and they so accurately convey the character\nof the Cornish coast, that _Mr. P._ felt quite the Cornishman, and\nis unable to decide whether he is the Tre Punch or the Pol Punch.\nOn mature deliberation, he concludes he is the Pen Punch. There's no\ndoubt about _that_!\n\nTHE WELL \"PROTECTED\" FEMALE.--Mrs. COLUMBIA.\n\nNOTICE.--Rejected Communications or Contributions, whether MS.,\nPrinted Matter, Drawings, or Pictures of any description, will in no\ncase be returned, not even when accompanied by a Stamped and Addressed\nEnvelope, Cover, or Wrapper.

The eldest, Marc-Alexandre, entering the army, made a splendid career for himself: he was a good speaker. The second, Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan, showing no particular aptitude for anything, lived mostly in the country, where he hunted, bred horses, and devoted himself to music and painting. The third son, Ren\\xc3\\xa9, destined from his childhood for the law, resigned his deputyship to avoid complicity in the Ferry decrees against the religious orders; and later, perceiving the revival under the presidency of Monsieur Falli\\xc3\\xa8res of the days of Decius and Diocletian, put his knowledge and zeal at the service of the persecuted Church.\r\n\r\nFrom the Concordat of 1801 down to the closing years of the Second Empire all the d'Esparvieus attended mass for the sake of example. Though sceptics in their inmost hearts, they looked upon religion as an instrument of government.\r\n\r\nMark and Ren\\xc3\\xa9 were the first of their race to show any sign of sincere devotion. The General, when still a colonel, had dedicated his regiment to the Sacred Heart, and he practised his faith with a fervour remarkable even in a soldier, though we all know that piety, daughter of Heaven, has marked out the hearts of the generals of the Third Republic as her chosen dwelling-place on earth.\r\n\r\nFaith has its vicissitudes. Under the old order the masses were believers, not so the aristocracy or the educated middle class. Under the First Empire the army from top to bottom was entirely irreligious. To-day the masses believe nothing. The middle classes wish to believe, and succeed at times, as did Marc and Ren\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu. Their brother Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan, on the contrary, the country gentleman, failed to attain to faith. He was an agnostic, a term commonly employed by the modish to avoid the odious one of freethinker. And he openly declared himself an agnostic, contrary to the admirable custom which deems it better to withhold the avowal.\r\n\r\nIn the century in which we live there are so many modes of belief and of unbelief that future historians will have difficulty in finding their way about. But are we any more successful in disentangling the condition of religious beliefs in the time of Symmachus or of Ambrose?\r\n\r\nA fervent Christian, Ren\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu was deeply attached to the liberal ideas his ancestors had transmitted to him as a sacred heritage. Compelled to oppose a Jacobin and atheistical Republic, he still called himself Republican. And it was in the name of liberty that he demanded the independence and sovereignty of the Church.\r\n\r\nDuring the long debates on the Separation and the quarrels over the Inventories, the synods of the bishops and the assemblies of the faithful were held in his house. While the most authoritatively accredited leaders of the Catholic party: prelates, generals, senators, deputies, journalists, were met together in the big green drawing-room, and every soul present turned towards Rome with a tender submission or enforced obedience; while Monsieur d'Esparvieu, his elbow on the marble chimney-piece, opposed civil law to canon law, and protested eloquently against the spoliation of the Church of France, two faces of other days, immobile and speechless, looked down on the modern crowd; on the right of the fire-place, painted by David, was Romain Bussart, a working-farmer at Esparvieu in shirt-sleeves and drill trousers, with a rough-and-ready air not untouched with cunning. He had good reason to smile: the worthy man laid the foundation of the family fortunes when he bought Church lands. On the left, painted by G\\xc3\\xa9rard in full-dress bedizened with orders, was the peasant's son, Baron Emile Bussart d'Esparvieu, prefect under the Empire, Keeper of the Great Seal under Charles X, who died in 1837, churchwarden of his parish, with couplets from _La Pucelle_ on his lips.\r\n\r\nRen\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu married in 1888 Marie-Antoinette Coupelle, daughter of Baron Coupelle, ironmaster at Blainville (Haute Loire). Madame Ren\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu had been president since 1903 of the Society of Christian Mothers. These perfect spouses, having married off their eldest daughter in 1908, had three children still at home--a girl and two boys.\r\n\r\nL\\xc3\\xa9on, the younger, aged seven, had a room next to his mother and his sister Berthe. Maurice, the elder, lived in a little pavilion comprising two rooms at the bottom of the garden. The young man thus gained a freedom which enabled him to endure family life. He was rather good-looking, smart without too much pretence, and the faint smile which merely raised one corner of his mouth did not lack charm.\r\n\r\nAt twenty-five Maurice possessed the wisdom of Ecclesiastes. Doubting whether a man hath any profit of all his labour which he taketh under the sun he never put himself out about anything. From his earliest childhood this young hopeful's sole concern with work had been considering how he might best avoid it, and it was through his remaining ignorant of the teaching of the _\\xc3\\x89cole de Droit_ that he became a doctor of law and a barrister at the Court of Appeal.\r\n\r\nHe neither pleaded nor practised. He had no knowledge and no desire to acquire any; wherein he conformed to his genius whose engaging fragility he forbore to overload; his instinct fortunately telling him that it was better to understand little than to misunderstand a lot.\r\n\r\nAs Monsieur l'Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Patouille expressed it, Maurice had received from Heaven the benefits of a Christian education. From his childhood piety was shown to him in the example of his home, and when on leaving college he was entered at the _\\xc3\\x89cole de Droit_, he found the lore of the doctors, the virtues of the confessors, and the constancy of the nursing mothers of the Church assembled around the paternal hearth. Admitted to social and political life at the time of the great persecution of the Church of France, Maurice did not fail to attend every manifestation of youthful Catholicism; he lent a hand with his parish barricades at the time of the Inventories, and with his companions he unharnessed the archbishop's horses when he was driven out from his palace. He showed on all these occasions a modified zeal; one never saw him in the front ranks of the heroic band exciting soldiers to a glorious disobedience or flinging mud and curses at the agents of the law.\r\n\r\nHe did his duty, nothing more; and if he distinguished himself on the occasion of the great pilgrimage of 1911 among the stretcher-bearers at Lourdes, we have reason to fear it was but to please Madame de la Verdeli\\xc3\\xa8re, who admired men of muscle. Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Patouille, a friend of the family and deeply versed in the knowledge of souls, knew that Maurice had only moderate aspirations to martyrdom. He reproached him with his lukewarmness, and pulled his ear, calling him a bad lot. Anyway, Maurice remained a believer.\r\n\r\nAmid the distractions of youth his faith remained intact, since he left it severely alone. He had never examined a single tenet. Nor had he enquired a whit more closely into the ideas of morality current in the grade of society to which he belonged. He took them just as they came. Thus in every situation that arose he cut an eminently respectable figure which he would have assuredly failed to do, had he been given to meditating on the foundations of morality. He was irritable and hot-tempered and possessed of a sense of honour which he was at great pains to cultivate. He was neither vain nor ambitious. Like the majority of Frenchmen, he disliked parting with his money. Women would never have obtained anything from him had they not known the way to make him give. He believed he despised them; the truth was he adored them. He indulged his appetites so naturally that he never suspected that he had any. What people did not know, himself least of all,--though the gleam that occasionally shone in his fine, light-brown eyes might have furnished the hint--was that he had a warm heart and was capable of friendship. For the rest, he was, in the ordinary intercourse of life, no very brilliant specimen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n     WHEREIN USEFUL INFORMATION WILL BE FOUND CONCERNING A      LIBRARY WHERE STRANGE THINGS WILL SHORTLY COME TO PASS\r\n\r\n\r\nDesirous of embracing the whole circle of human knowledge, and anxious to bequeath to the world a concrete symbol of his encyclop\\xc3\\xa6dic genius and a display in keeping with his pecuniary resources, Baron Alexandre d'Esparvieu had formed a library of three hundred and sixty thousand volumes, both printed and in manuscript, whereof the greater part emanated from the Benedictines of Ligug\\xc3\\xa9.\r\n\r\nBy a special clause in his will he enjoined his heirs to add to his library, after his death, whatever they might deem worthy of note in natural, moral, political, philosophical, and religious science.\r\n\r\nHe had indicated the sums which might be drawn from his estate for the fulfilment of this object, and charged his eldest son, Fulgence-Adolphe, to proceed with these additions. Fulgence-Adolphe accomplished with filial respect the wishes expressed by his illustrious father.\r\n\r\nAfter him, this huge library, which represented more than one child's share of the estate, remained undivided between the Senator's three sons and two daughters; and Ren\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu, on whom devolved the house in the Rue Garanci\\xc3\\xa8re, became the guardian of the valuable collection. His two sisters, Madame Paulet de Saint-Fain and Madame Cuissart, repeatedly demanded that such a large but unremunerative piece of property should be turned into money. But Ren\\xc3\\xa9 and Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan bought in the shares of their two co-legatees, and the library was saved. Ren\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu even busied himself in adding to it, thus fulfilling the intentions of its founder. But from year to year he lessened the number and importance of the acquisitions, opining that the intellectual output in Europe was on the wane.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan enriched it, out of his funds, with works published both in France and abroad which he thought good, and he was not lacking in judgment, though his brothers would never allow that he had a particle. Thanks to this man of leisurely and inquiring mind, Baron Alexandre's collection was kept practically up to date. Even at the present day the d'Esparvieu library, in the departments of theology, jurisprudence, and history is one of the finest private libraries in all Europe. Here you may study physical science, or to put it better, physical sciences in all their branches, and for that matter metaphysic or metaphysics, that is to say, all that is connected with physics and has no other name, so impossible is it to designate by a substantive that which has no substance, and is but a dream and an illusion. Here you may contemplate with admiration philosophers addressing themselves to the solution, dissolution, and resolution of the Absolute, to the determination of the Indeterminate and to the definition of the Infinite.\r\n\r\nAmid this pile of books and booklets, both sacred and profane, you may find everything down to the latest and most fashionable pragmatism.\r\n\r\nOther libraries there are, more richly abounding in bindings of venerable antiquity and illustrious origin, whose smooth and soft-hued texture render them delicious to the touch; bindings which the gilder's art has enriched with gossamer, lace-work, foliage, flowers, emblematic devices, and coats of arms; bindings that charm the studious eye with their tender radiance. Other libraries perhaps harbour a greater array of manuscripts illuminated with delicate and brilliant miniatures by artists of Venice, Flanders, or Touraine. But in handsome, sound editions of ancient and modern writers, both sacred and profane, the d'Esparvieu library is second to none. Here one finds all that has come down to us from antiquity; all the Fathers of the Church, the Apologists and the Decretalists, all the Humanists of the Renaissance, all the Encylop\\xc3\\xa6dists, the whole world of philosophy and science. Therefore it was that Cardinal Merlin, when he deigned to visit it, remarked:\r\n\r\n\"There is no man whose brain is equal to containing all the knowledge which is piled upon these shelves. Happily it doesn't matter.\"\r\n\r\nMonseigneur Cachepot, who worked there often when a curate in Paris, was in the habit of saying:\r\n\r\n\"I see here the stuff to make many a Thomas Aquinas and many an Arius, if only the modern mind had not lost its ancient ardour for good and evil.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no gainsaying that the manuscripts formed the more valuable portion of this immense collection. Noteworthy indeed was the unpublished correspondence of Gassendi, of Father Mersenne, and of Pascal, which threw a new light on the spirit of the seventeenth century. Nor must we forget the Hebrew Bibles, the Talmuds, the Rabbinical treatises, printed and in manuscript, the Aramaic and Samaritan texts, on sheepskin and on tablets of sycamore; in fine, all these antique and valuable copies collected in Egypt and in Syria by the celebrated Mo\\xc3\\xafse de Dina, and acquired at a small cost by Alexandre d'Esparvieu in 1836, when the learned Hebraist died of old age and poverty in Paris.\r\n\r\nThe Esparvienne library occupied the whole of the second floor of the old house. The works thought to be of but mediocre interest, such as books of Protestant exegesis of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the gift of Monsieur Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan, were relegated unbound to the limbo of the upper regions. The catalogue, with its various supplements, ran into no less than eighteen folio volumes. It was quite up to date, and the library was in perfect order. Monsieur Julien Sariette, archivist and pal\\xc3\\xa6ographer, who, being poor and retiring, used to make his living by teaching, became, in 1895, tutor to young Maurice on the recommendation of the Bishop of Agra, and with scarcely an interval found himself curator of the Biblioth\\xc3\\xa8que Esparvienne. Endowed with business-like energy and dogged patience, Monsieur Sariette himself classified all the members of this vast body. The system he invented and put into practice was so complicated, the labels he put on the books were made up of so many capital letters and small letters, both Latin and Greek, so many Arabic and Roman numerals, asterisks, double asterisks, triple asterisks, and those signs which in arithmetic express powers and roots, that the mere study of it would have involved more time and labour than would have been required for the complete mastery of algebra, and as no one could be found who would give the hours, that might be more profitably employed in discovering the law of numbers, to the solving of these cryptic symbols, Monsieur Sariette remained the only one capable of finding his way among the intricacies of his system, and without his help it had become an utter impossibility to discover, among the three hundred and sixty thousand volumes confided to his care, the particular volume one happened to require. Such was the result of his labours. Far from complaining about it, he experienced on the contrary a lively satisfaction.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Sariette loved his library. He loved it with a jealous love. He was there every day at seven o'clock in the morning busy cataloguing at a huge mahogany desk. The slips in his handwriting filled an enormous case standing by his side surmounted by a plaster bust of Alexandre d'Esparvieu. Alexandre wore his hair brushed straight back, and had a sublime look on his face. Like Chateaubriand, he affected little feathery side whiskers. His lips were pursed, his bosom bare. Punctually at midday Monsieur Sariette used to sally forth to lunch at a _cr\\xc3\\xa8merie_ in the narrow gloomy Rue des Canettes. It was known as the _Cr\\xc3\\xa8merie des Quatre \\xc3\\x89v\\xc3\\xaaques_, and had once been the haunt of Baudelaire, Theodore de Banville, Charles Asselineau, and a certain grandee of Spain who had translated the \"Mysteries of Paris\" into the language of the _conquistadores_. And the ducks that paddled so nicely on the old stone sign which gave its name to the street used to recognize Monsieur Sariette. At a quarter to one, to the very minute, he went back to his library, where he remained until seven o'clock. He then again betook himself to the _Quatre \\xc3\\x89v\\xc3\\xaaques_, and sat down to his frugal dinner, with its crowning glory of stewed prunes. Every evening, after dinner, his crony, Monsieur Guinardon, universally known as P\\xc3\\xa8re Guinardon, a scene-painter and picture-restorer, who used to do work for churches, would come from his garret in the Rue Princesse to have his coffee and liqueur at the _Quatre \\xc3\\x89v\\xc3\\xaaques_, and the two friends would play their game of dominoes.\r\n\r\nOld Guinardon, who was like some rugged old tree still full of sap, was older than he could bring himself to believe. He had known Chenavard. His chastity was positively ferocious, and he was for ever denouncing the impurities of neo-paganism in language of alarming obscenity. He loved talking. Monsieur Sariette was a ready listener. Old Guinardon's favourite subject was the Chapelle des Anges in St. Sulpice, in which the paintings were peeling off the walls, and which he was one day to restore; when, that is, it should please God, for, since the Separation, the churches belonged solely to God, and no one would undertake the responsibility of even the most urgent repairs. But old Guinardon demanded no salary.\r\n\r\n\"Michael is my patron saint,\" he said. \"And I have a special devotion for the Holy Angels.\"\r\n\r\nAfter they had had their game of dominoes, Monsieur Sariette, very thin and small, and old Guinardon, sturdy as an oak, hirsute as a lion, and tall as a Saint Christopher, went off chatting away side by side across the Place Saint Sulpice, heedless of whether the night were fine or stormy. Monsieur Sariette always went straight home, much to the regret of the painter, who was a gossip and a nightbird.\r\n\r\nThe following day, as the clock struck seven, Monsieur Sariette would take up his place in the library, and resume his cataloguing. As he sat at his desk, however, he would dart a Medusa-like look at anyone who entered, fearing lest he should prove to be a book-borrower. It was not merely the magistrates, politicians, and prelates whom he would have liked to turn to stone when they came to ask for the loan of a book with an air of authority bred of their familiarity with the master of the house. He would have done as much to Monsieur Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan, the library's benefactor, when he wanted some gay or scandalous old volume wherewith to beguile a wet day in the country. He would have meted out similar treatment to Madame Ren\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu, when she came to look for a book to read to her sick poor in hospital, and even to Monsieur Ren\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu himself, who generally contented himself with the Civil Code and a volume of Dalloz. The borrowing of the smallest book seemed like dragging his heart out. To refuse a volume even to such as had the most incontestable right to it, Monsieur Sariette would invent countless far-fetched or clumsy fibs, and did not even shrink from slandering himself as curator or from casting doubts on his own vigilance by saying that such and such a book was mislaid or lost, when a moment ago he had been gloating over that very volume or pressing it to his bosom. And when ultimately forced to part with a volume he would take it back a score of times from the borrower before he finally relinquished it.\r\n\r\nHe was always in agony lest one of the objects confided to his care should escape him. As the guardian of three hundred and sixty thousand volumes, he had three hundred and sixty thousand reasons for alarm. Sometimes he woke at night bathed in sweat, and uttering a cry of fear, because he had dreamed he had seen a gap on one of the shelves of his bookcases. It seemed to him a monstrous, unheard-of, and most grievous thing that a volume should leave its habitat. This noble rapacity exasperated Monsieur Ren\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu, who, failing to understand the good qualities of his paragon of a librarian, called him an old maniac. Monsieur Sariette knew nought of this injustice, but he would have braved the cruellest misfortune and endured opprobrium and insult to safeguard the integrity of his trust. Thanks to his assiduity, his vigilance and zeal, or, in a word, to his love, the Esparvienne library had not lost so much as a single leaflet under his supervision during the sixteen years which had now rolled by, this ninth of September, 1912.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n     WHEREIN THE MYSTERY BEGINS\r\n\r\n\r\nAt seven o'clock on the evening of that day, having as usual replaced all the books which had been taken from their shelves, and having assured himself that he was leaving everything in good order, he quitted the library, double-locking the door after him. According to his usual habit, he dined at the _Cr\\xc3\\xa8merie des Quatre \\xc3\\x89v\\xc3\\xaaques_, read his newspaper, _La Croix_, and at ten o'clock went home to his little house in the Rue du Regard. The good man had no trouble and no presentiment of evil; his sleep was peaceful. The next morning at seven o'clock to the minute, he entered the little room leading to the library, and, according to his daily habit, doffed his grand frock-coat, and taking down an old one which hung in a cupboard over his washstand, put it on. Then he went in to his workroom, where for sixteen years he had been cataloguing six days out of the seven, under the lofty gaze of Alexandre d'Esparvieu. Preparing to make a round of the various rooms, he entered the first and largest, which contained works on theology and religion in huge cupboards whose cornices were adorned with bronze-coloured busts of poets and orators of ancient days.\r\n\r\nTwo enormous globes representing the earth and the heavens filled the window-embrasures. But at his first step Monsieur Sariette stopped dead, stupefied, powerless alike to doubt or to credit what his eyes beheld. On the blue cloth cover of the writing-table books lay scattered about pell-mell, some lying flat, some standing upright. A number of quartos were heaped up in a tottering pile. Two Greek lexicons, one inside the other, formed a single being more monstrous in shape than the human couples of the divine Plato. A gilt-edged folio was all a-gape, showing three of its leaves disgracefully dog's-eared.\r\n\r\nHaving, after an interval of some moments, recovered from his profound amazement, the librarian went up to the table and recognised in the confused mass his most valuable Hebrew, French, and Latin Bibles, a unique Talmud, Rabbinical treatises printed and in manuscript, Aramaic and Samaritan texts and scrolls from the synagogues--in fine, the most precious relics of Israel all lying in a disordered heap, gaping and crumpled.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Sariette found himself confronted with an inexplicable phenomenon; nevertheless he sought to account for it. How eagerly he would have welcomed the idea that Monsieur Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan, who, being a thoroughly unprincipled man, presumed on the right gained him by his fatal liberality towards the library to rummage there unhindered during his sojourns in Paris, had been the author of this terrible disorder. But Monsieur Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan was away travelling in Italy. After pondering for some minutes Monsieur Sariette's next supposition was that Monsieur Ren\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu had entered the library late in the evening with the keys of his manservant Hippolyte, who, for the past twenty-five years, had looked after the second floor and the attics. Monsieur Ren\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu, however, never worked at night, and did not read Hebrew. Perhaps, thought Monsieur Sariette, perhaps he had brought or allowed to be brought to this room some priest, or Jerusalem monk, on his way through Paris; some Oriental _savant_ given to scriptural exegesis. Monsieur Sariette next wondered whether the Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Patouille, who had an enquiring mind, and also a habit of dog's-earing his books, had, peradventure, flung himself on these talmudic and biblical texts, fired with sudden zeal to lay bare the soul of Shem. He even asked himself for a moment whether Hippolyte, the old manservant, who had swept and dusted the library for a quarter of a century, and had been slowly poisoned by the dust of accumulated knowledge, had allowed his curiosity to get the better of him, and had been there during the night, ruining his eyesight and his reason, and losing his soul poring by moonlight over these undecipherable symbols. Monsieur Sariette even went so far as to imagine that young Maurice, on leaving his club or some nationalist meeting, might have torn these Jewish volumes from their shelves, out of hatred for old Jacob and his modern posterity; for this young man of family was a declared anti-semite, and only consorted with those Jews who were as anti-semitic as himself. It was giving a very free rein to his imagination, but Monsieur Sariette's brain could not rest, and went wandering about among speculations of the wildest extravagance.\r\n\r\nImpatient to know the truth, the zealous guardian of the library called the manservant.\r\n\r\nHippolyte knew nothing. The porter at the lodge could not furnish any clue. None of the domestics had heard a sound. Monsieur Sariette went down to the study of Monsieur Ren\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu, who received him in nightcap and dressing-gown, listened to his story with the air of a serious man bored with idle chatter, and dismissed him with words which conveyed a cruel implication of pity.\r\n\r\n\"Do not worry, my good Monsieur Sariette; be sure that the books were lying where you left them last night.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur Sariette reiterated his enquiries a score of times, discovered nothing, and suffered such anxiety that sleep entirely forsook him. When, on the following day at seven o'clock he entered the room with the busts and globes, and saw that all was in order, he heaved a sigh of relief. Then suddenly his heart beat fit to burst. He had just seen lying flat on the mantelpiece a paper-bound volume, a modern work, the boxwood paper-knife which had served to cut its pages still thrust between the leaves. It was a dissertation on the two parallel versions of Genesis, a work which Monsieur Sariette had relegated to the attic, and which had never left it up to now, no one in Monsieur d'Esparvieu's circle having had the curiosity to differentiate between the parts for which the polytheistic and monotheistic contributors were respectively responsible in the formation of the first of the sacred books. This book bore the label R > 3214-VIII/2. And this painful truth was suddenly borne in upon the mind of Monsieur Sariette: to wit, that the most scientific system of numbering will not help to find a book if the book is no longer in its place. Every day of the ensuing month found the table littered with books. Greek and Latin lay cheek by jowl with Hebrew. Monsieur Sariette asked himself whether these nocturnal flittings were the work of evil-doers who entered by the skylights to steal valuable and precious volumes. But he found no traces of burglary, and, notwithstanding the most minute search, failed to discover that anything had disappeared. Terrible anxiety took possession of his mind, and he fell to wondering whether it was possible that some monkey in the neighbourhood came down the chimney and acted the part of a person engaged in study. Deriving his knowledge of the habits of these animals in the main from the paintings of Watteau and Chardin, he took it that, in the art of imitating gestures or assuming characters they resembled Harlequin, Scaramouch, Zerlin, and the Doctors of the Italian comedy; he imagined them handling a palette and brushes, pounding drugs in a mortar, or turning over the leaves of an old treatise on alchemy beside an athanor. And so it was that, when, on one unhappy morning, he saw a huge blot of ink on one of the leaves of the third volume of the polyglot Bible bound in blue morocco and adorned with the arms of the Comte de Mirabeau, he had no doubt that a monkey was the author of the evil deed. The monkey had been pretending to take notes and had upset the inkpot. It must be a monkey belonging to a learned professor.\r\n\r\nImbued with this idea, Monsieur Sariette carefully studied the topography of the district, so as to draw a cordon round the group of houses amid which the d'Esparvieu house stood. Then he visited the four surrounding streets, asking at every door if there was a monkey in the house. He interrogated porters and their wives, washer-women, servants, a cobbler, a greengrocer, a glazier, clerks in bookshops, a priest, a bookbinder, two guardians of the peace, children, thus testing the diversity of character and variety of temper in one and the same people; for the replies he received were quite dissimilar in nature; some were rough, some were gentle; there were the coarse and the polished, the simple and the ironical, the prolix and the abrupt, the brief and even the silent. But of the animal he sought he had had neither sight nor sound, when under the archway of an old house in the Rue Servandoni, a small freckled, red-haired girl who looked after the door, made reply:\r\n\r\n\"There is Monsieur Ordonneau's monkey; would you care to see it?\"\r\n\r\nAnd without another word she conducted the old man to a stable at the other end of the yard. There on some rank straw and old bits of cloth, a young macaco with a chain round his middle sat and shivered. He was no taller than a five-year-old child. His livid face, his wrinkled brow, his thin lips were all expressive of mortal sadness. He fixed on the visitor the still lively gaze of his yellow eyes. Then with his small dry hand he seized a carrot, put it to his mouth, and forthwith flung it away. Having looked at the newcomers for a moment, the exile turned away his head, as if he expected nothing further of mankind or of life. Sitting huddled up, one knee in his hand, he made no further movement, but at times a dry cough shook his breast.\r\n\r\n\"It's Edgar,\" said the small girl. \"He is for sale, you know.\"\r\n\r\nBut the old book-lover, who had come armed with anger and resentment, thinking to find a cynical enemy, a monster of malice, an antibibliophile, stopped short, surprised, saddened, and overcome, before this little being devoid of strength and joy and hope.\r\n\r\nRecognising his mistake, troubled by the almost human face which sorrow and suffering made more human still, he murmured \"Forgive me\" and bowed his head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n     WHICH IN ITS FORCEFUL BREVITY PROJECTS US TO THE LIMITS OF      THE ACTUAL WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo months elapsed; the domestic upheaval did not subside, and Monsieur Sariette's thoughts turned to the Freemasons. The papers he read were full of their crimes. Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Patouille deemed them capable of the darkest deeds, and believed them to be in league with the Jews and meditating the total overthrow of Christendom.\r\n\r\nHaving now arrived at the acme of power, they wielded a dominating influence in all the principal departments of State, they ruled the Chambers, there were five of them in the Ministry, and they filled the \\xc3\\x89lys\\xc3\\xa9e. Having some time since assassinated a President of the Republic because he was a patriot, they were getting rid of the accomplices and witnesses of their execrable crime. Few days passed without Paris being terror-stricken at some mysterious murder hatched in their Lodges. These were facts concerning which no doubt was possible. By what means did they gain access to the library? Monsieur Sariette could not imagine. What task had they come to fulfil? Why did they attack sacred antiquity and the origins of the Church? What impious designs were they forming? A heavy shadow hung over these terrible undertakings. The Catholic archivist feeling himself under the eye of the sons of Hiram was terrified and fell ill.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he recovered, when he resolved to pass the night in the very spot where these terrible mysteries were enacted, and to take the subtle and dangerous visitors by surprise. It was an enterprise that demanded all his slender courage. Being a man of delicate physique and of nervous temperament, Monsieur Sariette was naturally inclined to be fearful. On the 8th of January at nine o'clock in the evening, while the city lay asleep under a whirling snowstorm, he built up a good fire in the room containing the busts of the ancient poets and philosophers, and ensconced himself in an arm-chair at the chimney corner, a rug over his knees. On a small stand within reach of his hand were a lamp, a bowl of black coffee, and a revolver borrowed from the youthful Maurice. He tried to read his paper, _La Croix_, but the letters danced beneath his eyes. So he stared hard in front of him, saw nothing but the shadows, heard nothing but the wind, and fell asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke the fire was out, the lamp was extinguished, leaving an acrid smell behind. But all around, the darkness was filled with milky brightness and phosphorescent lights. He thought he saw something flutter on the table. Stricken to the marrow with cold and terror, but upheld by a resolve stronger than any fear, he rose, approached the table, and passed his hands over the cloth. He saw nothing; even the lights faded, but under his fingers he felt a folio wide open; he tried to close it, the book resisted, jumped up and hit the imprudent librarian three blows on the head.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Sariette fell down unconscious....\r\n\r\nSince then things had gone from bad to worse. Books left their allotted shelves in greater profusion than ever, and sometimes it was impossible to replace them; they disappeared. Monsieur Sariette discovered fresh losses daily. The Bollandists were now an imperfect set, thirty volumes of exegesis were missing. He himself had become unrecognisable. His face had shrunk to the size of one's fist and grown yellow as a lemon, his neck was elongated out of all proportion, his shoulders drooped, the clothes he wore hung on him as on a peg. He ate nothing, and at the _Cr\\xc3\\xa8merie des Quatre \\xc3\\x89v\\xc3\\xaaques_ he would sit with dull eyes and bowed head, staring fixedly and vacantly at the saucer where, in a muddy juice, floated his stewed prunes. He did not hear old Guinardon relate how he had at last begun to restore the Delacroix paintings at St. Sulpice.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Ren\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu, when he heard the unhappy curator's alarming reports, used to answer drily:\r\n\r\n\"These books have been mislaid, they are not lost; look carefully, Monsieur Sariette, look carefully and you will find them.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he murmured behind the old man's back:\r\n\r\n\"Poor old Sariette is in a bad way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" replied Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Patouille, \"that his brain is going.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n     WHEREIN EVERYTHING SEEMS STRANGE BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS      LOGICAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chapel of the Holy Angels, which lies on the right hand as you enter the Church of St. Sulpice, was hidden behind a scaffolding of planks. Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Patouille, Monsieur Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan, Monsieur Maurice, his nephew, and Monsieur Sariette, entered in single file through the low door cut in the wooden hoarding, and found old Guinardon on the top of his ladder standing in front of the Heliodorus. The old artist, surrounded by all sorts of tools and materials, was putting a white paste in the crack which cut in two the High Priest Onias. Z\\xc3\\xa9phyrine, Paul Baudry's favourite model, Z\\xc3\\xa9phyrine, who had lent her golden hair and polished shoulders to so many Magdalens, Marguerites, sylphs, and mermaids, and who, it is said, was beloved of the Emperor Napoleon III, was standing at the foot of the ladder with tangled locks, cadaverous cheeks, and dim eyes, older than old Guinardon, whose life she had shared for more than half a century. She had brought the painter's lunch in a basket.\r\n\r\nAlthough the slanting rays fell grey and cold through the leaded and iron-barred window, Delacroix's colouring shone resplendent, and the roses on the cheeks of men and angels dimmed with their glorious beauty the rubicund countenance of old Guinardon, which stood out in relief against one of the temple's columns. These frescoes of the Chapel of the Holy Angels, though derided and insulted when they first appeared, have now become part of the classic tradition, and are united in immortality with the masterpieces of Rubens and Tintoretto.\r\n\r\nOld Guinardon, bearded and long-haired, looked like Father Time effacing the works of man's genius. Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan, in alarm, called out to him:\r\n\r\n\"Carefully, Monsieur Guinardon, carefully. Do not scrape too much.\"\r\n\r\nThe painter reassured him.\r\n\r\n\"Fear nothing, Monsieur Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan. I do not paint in that style. My art is a higher one. I work after the manner of Cimabue, Giotto, and Beato Angelico, not in the style of Delacroix. This surface here is too heavily charged with contrast and opposition to give a really sacred effect. It is true that Chenavard said that Christianity loves the picturesque, but Chenavard was a rascal with neither faith nor principle--an infidel.... Look, Monsieur d'Esparvieu, I fill up the crevice, I relay the scales of paint which are peeling. That is all.... The damage, due to the sinking of the wall, or more probably to a seismic shock, is confined to a very small space. This painting of oil and wax applied on a very dry foundation is far more solid than one might think.\r\n\r\n\"I saw Delacroix engaged on this work. Impassioned but anxious, he modelled feverishly, scraped out, re-painted unceasingly; his mighty hand made childish blunders, but the thing is done with the mastery of a genius and the inexperience of a schoolboy. It is a marvel how it holds.\"\r\n\r\nThe good man was silent, and went on filling in the crevice.\r\n\r\n\"How classic and traditional the composition is,\" said Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan. \"Time was when one could recognise nothing but its amazing novelty; now one can see in it a multitude of old Italian formulas.\"\r\n\r\n\"I may allow myself the luxury of being just, I possess the qualifications,\" said the old man from the top of his lofty ladder. \"Delacroix lived in a blasphemous and godless age. A painter of the decadence, he was not without pride nor grandeur. He was greater than his times. But he lacked faith, single-heartedness, and purity. To be able to see and paint angels he needed that virtue of angels and primitives, that supreme virtue which, with God's help, I do my best to practise, chastity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue, Michel; you are as big a brute as any of them.\"\r\n\r\nThus Z\\xc3\\xa9phyrine, devoured with jealousy because that very morning on the stairs she had seen her lover kiss the bread-woman's daughter, to wit the youthful Octavie, who was as squalid and radiant as one of Rembrandt's Brides. She had loved Michel madly in the happy days long since past, and love had never died out in Z\\xc3\\xa9phyrine's heart.\r\n\r\nOld Guinardon received the flattering insult with a smile that he dissembled, and raised his eyes to the ceiling, where the archangel Michael, terrible in azure cuirass and gilt helmet, was springing heavenwards in all the radiance of his glory.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Patouille, blinking, and shielding his eyes with his hat against the glaring light from the window, began to examine the pictures one after another: Heliodorus being scourged by the angels, St. Michael vanquishing the Demons, and the combat of Jacob and the Angel.\r\n\r\n\"All this is exceedingly fine,\" he murmured at last, \"but why has the artist only represented wrathful angels on these walls? Look where I will in this chapel, I see but heralds of celestial anger, ministers of divine vengeance. God wishes to be feared; He wishes also to be loved. I would fain perceive on these walls messengers of peace and of clemency. I should like to see the Seraphim who purified the lips of the prophet, St. Raphael who gave back his sight to old Tobias, Gabriel who announced the Mystery of the Incarnation to Mary, the Angel who delivered St. Peter from his chains, the Cherubim who bore the dead St. Catherine to the top of Sinai. Above all, I should like to be able to contemplate those heavenly guardians which God gives to every man baptized in His name. We each have one who follows all our steps, who comforts us and upholds us. It would be pleasant indeed to admire these enchanting spirits, these beautiful faces.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Abb\\xc3\\xa9! it depends on the point of view,\" answered Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan. \"Delacroix was no sentimentalist. Old Ingres was not very far wrong in saying that this great man's work reeks of fire and brimstone. Look at the sombre, splendid beauty of those angels, look at those androgynes so proud and fierce, at those pitiless youths who lift avenging rods against Heliodorus, note this mysterious wrestler touching the patriarch on the hip....\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush,\" said Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Patouille. \"According to the Bible he is no angel like the others; if he be an angel, he is the Angel of Creation, the Eternal Son of God. I am surprised that the Venerable Cur\\xc3\\xa9 of St. Sulpice, who entrusted the decoration of this chapel to Monsieur Eug\\xc3\\xa8ne Delacroix, did not tell him that the patriarch's symbolic struggle with Him who was nameless took place in profound darkness, and that the subject is quite out of place here, since it prefigures the Incarnation of Jesus Christ. The best artists go astray when they fail to obtain their ideas of Christian iconography from a qualified ecclesiastic. The institutions of Christian art form the subject of numerous works with which you are doubtless acquainted, Monsieur Sariette.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur Sariette was gazing vacantly about him. It was the third morning after his adventurous night in the library. Being, however, thus called upon by the venerable ecclesiastic, he pulled himself together and replied:\r\n\r\n\"On this subject we may with advantage consult Molanus, _De Historia Sacrarum Imaginum et Picturarum_, in the edition given us by No\\xc3\\xabl Paquot, dated Louvain, 1771; Cardinal Frederico Borromeo, _De Pictura Sacra_, and the Iconography of Didron; but this last work must be read with caution.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus spoken, Monsieur Sariette relapsed into silence. He was pondering on his devastated library.\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand,\" continued Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Patouille, \"since an example of the holy anger of the angels was necessary in this chapel, the painter is to be commended for having depicted for us in imitation of Raphael the heavenly messengers who chastised Heliodorus. Ordered by Seleucus, King of Syria, to carry off the treasures contained in the Temple, Heliodorus was stricken by an angel in a cuirass of gold mounted on a magnificently caparisoned steed. Two other angels smote him with rods. He fell to earth, as Monsieur Delacroix shows us here, and was swallowed up in darkness. It is right and salutary that this adventure should be cited as an example to the Republican Commissioners of Police and to the sacrilegious agents of the law. There will always be Heliodoruses, but, let it be known, every time they lay their hands on the property of the Church, which is the property of the poor, they shall be chastised with rods and blinded by the angels.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like this painting, or, better still, Raphael's sublimer conception of the same subject, to be engraved in little pictures fully coloured, and distributed as rewards in all the schools.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uncle,\" said young Maurice, with a yawn, \"I think these things are simply ghastly. I prefer Matisse and Metzinger.\"\r\n\r\nThese words fell unheeded, and old Guinardon from his ladder held forth:\r\n\r\n\"Only the primitives caught a glimpse of Heaven. Beauty is only to be found between the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries. The antique, the impure antique, which regained its pernicious influence over the minds of the sixteenth century, inspired poets and painters with criminal notions and immodest conceptions, with horrid impurities, filth. All the artists of the Renaissance were swine, including Michael-Angelo.\"\r\n\r\nThen, perceiving that Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan was on the point of departure, P\\xc3\\xa8re Guinardon assumed an air of bonhomie, and said to him in a confidential tone:\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan, if you're not afraid of climbing up my five flights, come and have a look at my den. I've got two or three little canvases I wouldn't mind parting with, and they might interest you. All good, honest, straightforward stuff. I'll show you, among other things, a tasty, spicy little Baudouin that would make your mouth water.\"\r\n\r\nAt this speech Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan made off. As he descended the church steps and turned down the Rue Princesse, he found himself accompanied by old Sariette, and fell to unburdening himself to him, as he would have done to any human creature, or indeed to a tree, a lamp-post, a dog, or his own shadow, of the indignation with which the \\xc3\\xa6sthetic theories of the old painter inspired him.\r\n\r\n\"Old Guinardon overdoes it with his Christian art and his Primitives! Whatever the artist conceives of Heaven is borrowed from earth; God, the Virgin, the Angels, men and women, saints, the light, the clouds. When he was designing figures for the chapel windows at Dreux, old Ingres drew from life a pure, fine study of a woman, which may be seen, among many others, in the Mus\\xc3\\xa9e Bonnat at Bayonne. Old Ingres had written at the bottom of the page in case he should forget: 'Mademoiselle C\\xc3\\xa9cile, admirable legs and thighs'--and so as to make Mademoiselle C\\xc3\\xa9cile into a saint in Paradise, he gave her a robe, a cloak, a veil, inflicting thus a shameful decline in her estate, for the tissues of Lyons and Genoa are worthless compared with the youthful living tissue, rosy with pure blood; the most beautiful draperies are despicable compared with the lines of a beautiful body. In fact, clothing for flesh that is desirable and ripe for wedlock is an unmerited shame, and the worst of humiliations\"; and Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan, walking carelessly in the gutter of the Rue Garanci\\xc3\\xa8re, continued: \"Old Guinardon is a pestilential idiot. He blasphemes Antiquity, sacred Antiquity, the age when the gods were kind. He exalts an epoch when the painter and the sculptor had all their lessons to learn over again. In point of fact, Christianity has run contrary to art in so much as it has not favoured the study of the nude. Art is the representation of nature, and nature is pre-eminently the human body; it is the nude.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon, pardon,\" purred old Sariette. \"There is such a thing as spiritual, or, as one might term it, inward beauty, which, since the days of Fra Angelico down to those of Hippolyte Flandrin, Christian art has--\"\r\n\r\nBut Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan, never hearing a word of all this, went on hurling his impetuous observations at the stones of the old street and the snow-laden clouds overhead:\r\n\r\n\"The Primitives cannot be judged as a whole, for they are utterly unlike each other. This old madman confounds them all together. Cimabue is a corrupt Byzantine, Giotto gives hints of powerful genius, but his modelling is bad, and, like children, he gives all his characters the same face. The early Italians have grace and joy, because they are Italians. The Venetians have an instinct for fine colour. But when all is said and done these exquisite craftsmen enamel and gild rather than paint. There is far too much softness about the heart and the colouring of your saintly Angelico for me. As for the Flemish school, that's quite another pair of shoes. They can use their hands, and in glory of workmanship they are on a level with the Chinese lacquer-workers. The technique of the brothers Van Eyck is a marvel, but I cannot discover in their Adoration of the Lamb the charm and mystery that some have vaunted. Everything in it is treated with a pitiless perfection; it is vulgar in feeling and cruelly ugly. Memling may touch one perhaps; but he creates nothing but sick wretches and cripples; under the heavy, rich, and ungraceful robing of his virgins and saints one divines some very lamentable anatomy. I did not wait for Rogier van der Wyden to call himself Roger de la Pasture and turn Frenchman in order to prefer him to Memling. This Rogier or Roger is less of a ninny; but then he is more lugubrious, and the rigidity of his lines bears eloquent testimony to his poverty-stricken figures. It is a strange perversion to take pleasure in these carnivalesque figures when one can have the paintings of Leonardo, Titian, Correggio, Velasquez, Rubens, Rembrandt, Poussin, or Prud'hon. Really it is a perverted instinct.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Patouille and Maurice d'Esparvieu were strolling leisurely along in the wake of the esthete and the librarian. As a general rule the Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Patouille was little inclined to talk theology with laymen, or, for that matter, with clerics either. Carried away, however, by the attractiveness of the subject, he was telling the youthful Maurice all about the sacred mission of those guardian angels which Monsieur Delacroix had so inopportunely excluded from his picture. And in order to give more adequate expression to his thoughts on such lofty themes, the Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Patouille borrowed whole phrases and sentences from Bossuet. He had got them up by heart to put in his sermons, for he adhered strongly to tradition.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my son,\" he was saying, \"God has appointed tutelary spirits to be near us. They come to us laden with His gifts. They return laden with our prayers. Such is their task. Not an hour, not a moment passes but they are at our side, ready to help us, ever fervent and unwearying guardians, watchmen that never slumber.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so, Abb\\xc3\\xa9,\" murmured Maurice, who was wondering by what cunning artifice he could get on the soft side of his mother and persuade her to give him some money of which he was urgently in need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n     WHEREIN P\\xc3\\x88RE SARIETTE DISCOVERS HIS MISSING TREASURES\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning Monsieur Sariette entered Monsieur Ren\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu's study without knocking. He raised his arms to the heavens, his few hairs were standing straight up on his head. His eyes were big with terror. In husky tones he stammered out the dreadful news. A very old manuscript of Flavius Josephus; sixty volumes of all sizes; a priceless jewel, namely, a _Lucretius_ adorned with the arms of Philippe de Vend\\xc3\\xb4me, Grand Prior of France, with notes in Voltaire's own hand; a manuscript of Richard Simon, and a set of Gassendi's correspondence with Gabriel Naud\\xc3\\xa9, comprising two hundred and thirty-eight unpublished letters, had disappeared. This time the owner of the library was alarmed.\r\n\r\nHe mounted in haste to the abode of the philosophers and the globes, and there with his own eyes confirmed the magnitude of the disaster.\r\n\r\nThere were yawning gaps on many a shelf. He searched here and there, opened cupboards, dragged out brooms, dusters, and fire-extinguishers, rattled the shovel in the coke fire, shook out Monsieur Sariette's best frock-coat that was hanging in the cloak-room, and then stood and gazed disconsolately at the empty places left by the Gassendi portfolios.\r\n\r\nFor the past half-century the whole learned world had been loudly clamouring for the publication of this correspondence. Monsieur Ren\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu had not responded to the universal desire, unwilling either to assume so heavy a task, or to resign it to others. Having found much boldness of thought in these letters, and many passages of more libertine tendency than the piety of the twentieth century could endure, he preferred that they should remain unpublished; but he felt himself responsible for their safe-keeping, not only to his country but to the whole civilized world.\r\n\r\n\"How can you have allowed yourself to be robbed of such a treasure?\" he asked severely of Monsieur Sariette.\r\n\r\n\"How can I have allowed myself to be robbed of such a treasure?\" repeated the unhappy librarian. \"Monsieur, if you opened my breast, you would find that question engraved upon my heart.\"\r\n\r\nUnmoved by this powerful utterance, Monsieur d'Esparvieu continued with pent-up fury:\r\n\r\n\"And you have discovered no single sign that would put you on the track of the thief, Monsieur Sariette? You have no suspicion, not the faintest idea, of the way these things have come to pass? You have seen nothing, heard nothing, noticed nothing, learnt nothing? You must grant this is unbelievable. Think, Monsieur Sariette, think of the possible consequences of this unheard-of theft, committed under your eyes. A document of inestimable value in the history of the human mind disappears. Who has stolen it? Why has it been stolen? Who will gain by it? Those who have got possession of it doubtless know that they will be unable to dispose of it in France. They will go and sell it in America or Germany. Germany is greedy for such literary monuments. Should the correspondence of Gassendi with Gabriel Naud\\xc3\\xa9 go over to Berlin, if it is published there by German savants, what a disaster, nay, what a scandal! Monsieur Sariette, have you not thought of that?...\"\r\n\r\nBeneath the stroke of an accusation all the more cruel in that he brought it against himself, Monsieur Sariette stood stupefied, and was silent. And Monsieur d'Esparvieu continued to overwhelm him with bitter reproaches.\r\n\r\n\"And you make no effort. You devise nothing to find these inestimable treasures. Make enquiries, bestir yourself, Monsieur Sariette; use your wits. It is well worth while.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Monsieur d'Esparvieu went out, throwing an icy glance at his librarian.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Sariette sought the lost books and manuscripts in every spot where he had already sought them a hundred times, and where they could not possibly be. He even looked in the coke-box and under the leather seat of his arm-chair. When midday struck he mechanically went downstairs. At the foot of the stairs he met his old pupil Maurice, with whom he exchanged a bow. But he only saw men and things as through a mist.\r\n\r\nThe broken-hearted curator had already reached the hall when Maurice called him back.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Sariette, while I think of it, do have the books removed that are choking up my garden-house.\"\r\n\r\n\"What books, Maurice?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could not tell you, Monsieur Sariette, but there are some in Hebrew, all worm-eaten, with a whole heap of old papers. They are in my way. You can't turn round in the passage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who took them there?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm bothered if I know.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the young man rushed off to the dining-room, the luncheon gong having sounded quite a minute ago.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Sariette tore away to the summer-house. Maurice had spoken the truth. About a hundred volumes were there, on tables, on chairs, even on the floor. When he saw them he was divided betwixt joy and fear, filled with amazement and anxiety. Happy in the finding of his lost treasure, dreading to lose it again, and completely overwhelmed with astonishment, the man of books alternately babbled like an infant and uttered the hoarse cries of a maniac. He recognised his Hebrew Bibles, his ancient Talmuds, his very old manuscript of Flavius Josephus, his portfolios of Gassendi's letters to Gabriel Naud\\xc3\\xa9, and his richest jewel of all, to wit, _Lucretius_ adorned with the arms of the Grand Prior of France, and with notes in Voltaire's own hand. He laughed, he cried, he kissed the morocco, the calf, the parchment, and vellum, even the wooden boards studded with nails.\r\n\r\nAs fast as Hippolyte, the manservant, returned with an armful to the library, Monsieur Sariette, with a trembling hand, restored them piously to their places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n     OF A SOMEWHAT LIVELY INTEREST, WHEREOF THE MORAL WILL, I      HOPE, APPEAL GREATLY TO MY READERS, SINCE IT CAN BE      EXPRESSED BY THIS SORROWFUL QUERY: \"THOUGHT, WHITHER DOST      THOU LEAD ME?\" FOR IT IS A UNIVERSALLY ADMITTED TRUTH THAT      IT IS UNHEALTHY TO THINK AND THAT TRUE WISDOM LIES IN NOT      THINKING AT ALL\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the books were now once more assembled in the pious keeping of Monsieur Sariette. But this happy reunion was not destined to last. The following night twenty volumes left their places, among them the _Lucretius_ of Prior de Vend\\xc3\\xb4me. Within a week the old Hebrew and Greek texts had all returned to the summer-house, and every night during the ensuing month they left their shelves and secretly went on the same path. Others betook themselves no one knew whither.\r\n\r\nOn hearing of these mysterious occurrences, Monsieur Ren\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu merely remarked with frigidity to his librarian:\r\n\r\n\"My poor Sariette, all this is very queer, very queer indeed.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when Monsieur Sariette tentatively advised him to lodge a formal complaint or to inform the Commissaire de Police, Monsieur d'Esparvieu cried out upon him:\r\n\r\n\"What are you suggesting, Monsieur Sariette? Divulge domestic secrets, make a scandal! You cannot mean it. I have enemies, and I am proud of it. I think I have deserved them. What I might complain about is that I am wounded in the house of my friend, attacked with unheard-of violence, by fervent loyalists, who, I grant you, are good Catholics, but exceedingly bad Christians.... In a word, I am watched, spied upon, shadowed, and you suggest, Monsieur Sariette, that I should make a present of this comic-opera mystery, this burlesque adventure, this story in which we both cut somewhat pitiable figures, to a set of spiteful journalists? Do you wish to cover me with ridicule?\"\r\n\r\nThe result of the colloquy was that the two gentlemen agreed to change all the locks in the library. Estimates were asked for and workmen called in. For six weeks the d'Esparvieu household rang from morning till night with the sound of hammers, the hum of centre-bits, and the grating of files. Fires were always going in the abode of the philosophers and globes, and the people of the house were simply sickened by the smell of heated oil. The old, smooth, easy-running locks were replaced, on the cupboards and doors of the rooms, by stubborn and tricky fastenings. There was nothing but combinations of locks, letter-padlocks, safety-bolts, bars, chains, and electric alarm-bells.\r\n\r\nAll this display of ironmongery inspired fear. The lock-cases glistened, and there was much grinding of bolts. To gain access to a room, a cupboard, or a drawer, it was necessary to know a certain number, of which Monsieur Sariette alone was cognisant. His head was filled with bizarre words and tremendous numbers, and he got entangled among all these cryptic signs, these square, cubic, and triangular figures. He himself couldn't get the doors and the cupboards undone, yet every morning he found them wide open, and the books thrown about, ransacked, and hidden away. In the gutter of the Rue Servandoni a policeman picked up a volume of Salomon Reinach on the identity of Barabbas and Jesus Christ. As it bore the book-plate of the d'Esparvieu library he returned it to the owner.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Ren\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu, not even deigning to inform Monsieur Sariette of the fact, made up his mind to consult a magistrate, a friend in whom he had complete confidence, to wit, a certain Monsieur des Aubels, Counsel at the Law Courts, who had put through many an important affair. He was a little plump man, very red, very bald, with a cranium that shone like a billiard ball. He entered the library one morning feigning to come as a book-lover, but he soon showed that he knew nothing about books. While all the busts of the ancient philosophers were reflected in his shining pate, he put divers insidious questions to Monsieur Sariette, who grew uncomfortable and turned red, for innocence is easily flustered. From that moment Monsieur des Aubels had a mighty suspicion that Monsieur Sariette was the perpetrator of the very thefts he denounced with horror; and it immediately occurred to him to seek out the accomplices of the crime. As regards motives, he did not trouble about them; motives are always to be found. Monsieur des Aubels told Monsieur Ren\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu that, if he liked, he would have the house secretly watched by a detective from the Prefecture.\r\n\r\n\"I will see that you get Mignon,\" he said. \"He is an excellent servant, assiduous and prudent.\"\r\n\r\nBy six o'clock next morning Mignon was already walking up and down outside the d'Esparvieus' house, his head sunk between his shoulders, wearing love-locks which showed from under the narrow brim of his bowler hat, his eye cocked over his shoulder. He wore an enormous dull-black moustache, his hands and feet were huge; in fact, his whole appearance was distinctly memorable. He paced regularly up and down from the nearest of the big rams' head pillars which adorn the H\\xc3\\xb4tel de la Sordi\\xc3\\xa8re to the end of the Rue Garanci\\xc3\\xa8re, towards the apse of St. Sulpice Church and the dome of the Chapel of the Virgin.\r\n\r\nHenceforth it became impossible to enter or leave the d'Esparvieus' house without feeling that one's every action, that one's very thoughts, were being spied upon. Mignon was a prodigious person endowed with powers that Nature denies to other mortals. He neither ate nor slept. At all hours of the day and night, in wind and rain, he was to be found outside the house, and no one escaped the X-rays of his eye. One felt pierced through and through, penetrated to the very marrow, worse than naked, bare as a skeleton. It was the affair of a moment; the detective did not even stop, but continued his everlasting walk. It became intolerable. Young Maurice threatened to leave the paternal roof if he was to be so radiographed. His mother and his sister Berthe complained of his piercing look; it offended the chaste modesty of their souls. Mademoiselle Caporal, young L\\xc3\\xa9on d'Esparvieu's governess, felt an indescribable embarrassment. Monsieur Ren\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu was sick of the whole business. He never crossed his own threshold without crushing his hat over his eyes to avoid the investigating ray and without wishing old Sariette, the _fons et origo_ of all the evil, at the devil. The intimates of the household, such as Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Patouille and Uncle Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan, made themselves scarce; visitors gave up calling, tradespeople hesitated about leaving their goods, the carts belonging to the big shops scarcely dared stop. But it was among the domestics that the spying roused the most disorder.\r\n\r\nThe footman, afraid, under the eye of the police, to go and join the cobbler's wife over her solitary labours in the afternoon, found the house unbearable and gave notice. Odile, Madame d'Esparvieu's lady's-maid, not daring, as was her custom after her mistress had retired, to introduce Octave, the handsomest of the neighbouring bookseller's clerks, to her little room upstairs, grew melancholy, irritable and nervous, pulled her mistress's hair while dressing it, spoke insolently, and made advances to Monsieur Maurice. The cook, Madame Malgoire, a serious matron of some fifty years, having no more visits from Auguste, the wine-merchant's man in the Rue Servandoni, and being incapable of suffering a privation so contrary to her temperament, went mad, sent up a raw rabbit to table, and announced that the Pope had asked her hand in marriage. At last, after a fortnight of superhuman assiduity, contrary to all known laws of organic life, and to the essential conditions of animal economy, Mignon, the detective, having observed nothing abnormal, ceased his surveillance and withdrew without a word, refusing to accept a gratuity. In the library the dance of the books became livelier than ever.\r\n\r\n\"That is all right,\" said Monsieur des Aubels. \"Since nothing comes in nor goes out, the evil-doer must be in the house.\"\r\n\r\nThe magistrate thought it possible to discover the criminal without police-warrant or enquiry. On a date agreed upon at midnight, he had the floor of the library, the treads of the stairs, the vestibule, the garden path leading to Monsieur Maurice's summer-house, and the entrance hall of the latter, all covered with a coating of talc.\r\n\r\nThe following morning Monsieur des Aubels, assisted by a photographer from the Prefecture, and accompanied by Monsieur Ren\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu and Monsieur Sariette, came to take the imprints. They found nothing in the garden, the wind had blown away the coating of talc; nothing in the summer-house either. Young Maurice told them he thought it was some practical joke and that he had brushed away the white dust with the hearth-brush. The real truth was, he had effaced the traces left by the boots of Odile, the lady's-maid. On the stairs and in the library the very light print of a bare foot could be discerned, it seemed to have sprung into the air and to have touched the ground at rare intervals and without any pressure. They discovered five of these traces. The clearest was to be found in the abode of the busts and spheres, on the edge of the table where the books were piled. The photographer took several negatives of this imprint.\r\n\r\n\"This is more terrifying than anything else,\" murmured Monsieur Sariette.\r\n\r\nMonsieur des Aubels did not hide his surprise.\r\n\r\nThree days later the anthropometrical department of the Prefecture returned the proofs exhibited to them, saying that they were not in the records.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner Monsieur Ren\\xc3\\xa9 showed the photographs to his brother Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan, who examined them with profound attention, and after a long silence exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"No wonder they have not got this at the Prefecture; it is the foot of a god or of an athlete of antiquity. The sole that made this impression is of a perfection unknown to our races and our climates. It exhibits toes of exquisite grace, and a divine heel.\"\r\n\r\nRen\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu cried out upon his brother for a madman.\r\n\r\n\"He is a poet,\" sighed Madame d'Esparvieu.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle,\" said Maurice, \"you'll fall in love with this foot if you ever come across it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such was the fate of Vivant Denon, who accompanied Bonaparte to Egypt,\" replied Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan. \"At Thebes, in a tomb violated by the Arabs, Denon found the little foot of a mummy of marvellous beauty. He contemplated it with extraordinary fervour, 'It is the foot of a young woman,' he pondered, 'of a princess--of a charming creature. No covering has ever marred its perfect shape.' Denon admired, adored, and loved it. You may see a drawing of this little foot in Denon's atlas of his journey to Egypt, whose leaves one could turn over upstairs, without going further afield, if only Monsieur Sariette would ever let us see a single volume of his library.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes, in bed, Maurice, waking in the middle of the night, thought he heard the sound of pages being turned over in the next room, and the thud of bound volumes falling on the floor.\r\n\r\nOne morning at five o'clock he was coming home from the club, after a night of bad luck, and while he stood outside the door of the summer-house, hunting in his pocket for his keys, his ears distinctly heard a voice sighing:\r\n\r\n\"Knowledge, whither dost thou lead me? Thought, whither dost thou lure me?\"\r\n\r\nBut entering the two rooms he saw nothing, and told himself that his ears must have deceived him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n     WHICH SPEAKS OF LOVE, A SUBJECT WHICH ALWAYS GIVES PLEASURE,      FOR A TALE WITHOUT LOVE IS LIKE BEEF WITHOUT MUSTARD: AN      INSIPID DISH\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing ever astonished Maurice. He never sought to know the causes of things and dwelt tranquilly in the world of appearances. Not denying the eternal truth, he nevertheless followed vain things as his fancy led him.\r\n\r\nLess addicted to sport and violent exercise than most young people of his generation, he followed unconsciously the old erotic traditions of his race. The French were ever the most gallant of men, and it were a pity they should lose this advantage. Maurice preserved it. He was in love with no woman, but, as St. Augustine said, he loved to love. After paying the tribute that was rightly due to the imperishable beauty and secret arts of Madame de la Bertheli\\xc3\\xa8re, he had enjoyed the impetuous caresses of a young singer called Luciole. At present he was joylessly experiencing the primitive perversity of Odile, his mother's lady's-maid, and the tearful adoration of the beautiful Madame Boittier. And he felt a great void in his heart.\r\n\r\nIt chanced that one Wednesday, on entering the drawing-room where his mother entertained her friends--who were, generally speaking, unattractive and austere ladies, with a sprinkling of old men and very young people--he noticed, in this intimate circle, Madame des Aubels, the wife of the magistrate at the Law Courts, whom Monsieur d'Esparvieu had vainly consulted on the mysterious ransacking of his library. She was young, he found her pretty, and not without cause. Gilberte had been modelled by the Genius of the Race, and no other genius had had a part in the work.\r\n\r\nThus all her attributes inspired desire, and nothing in her shape or her being aroused any other sentiment.\r\n\r\nThe law of attraction which draws world to world moved young Maurice to approach this delicious creature, and under its influence he offered to escort her to the tea-table. And when Gilberte was served with tea, he said:\r\n\r\n\"We should hit it off quite well together, you and I, don't you think?\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke in this way, according to modern usage, so as to avoid inane compliments and to spare a woman the boredom of listening to one of those old declarations of love which, containing nothing but what is vague and undefined, require neither a truthful nor an exact reply.\r\n\r\nAnd profiting by the fact that he had an opportunity of conversing secretly with Madame des Aubels for a few minutes, he spoke urgently and to the point. Gilberte, so far as one could judge, was made rather to awaken desire than to feel it. Nevertheless, she well knew that her fate was to love, and she followed it willingly and with pleasure. Maurice did not particularly displease her. She would have preferred him to be an orphan, for experience had taught her how disappointing it sometimes is to love the son of the house.\r\n\r\n\"Will you?\" he said by way of conclusion.\r\n\r\nShe pretended not to understand, and with her little _foie-gras_ sandwich raised half-way to her mouth she looked at Maurice with wondering eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Will I _what_?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"You know quite well.\"\r\n\r\nMadame des Aubels lowered her eyes, and sipped her tea, for her prudishness was not quite vanquished. Meanwhile Maurice, taking her empty cup from her hand, murmured:\r\n\r\n\"Saturday, five o'clock, 126 Rue de Rome, on the ground-floor, the door on the right, under the arch. Knock three times.\"\r\n\r\nMadame des Aubels glanced severely and imperturbably at the son of the house, and with a self-possessed air rejoined the circle of highly respectable women to whom the Senator Monsieur Le Fol was explaining how artificial incubators were employed at the agricultural colony at St. Julienne.\r\n\r\nThe following Saturday, Maurice, in his ground-floor flat, awaited Madame des Aubels. He waited her in vain. No light hand came to knock three times on the door under the arch. And Maurice gave way to imprecation, inwardly calling the absent one a jade and a hussy. His fruitless wait, his frustrated desires, rendered him unjust. For Madame des Aubels in not coming where she had never promised to go hardly deserved these names; but we judge human actions by the pleasure or pain they cause us.\r\n\r\nMaurice did not put in an appearance in his mother's drawing-room until a fortnight after the conversation at the tea-table. He came late. Madame des Aubels had been there for half an hour. He bowed coldly to her, took a seat some way off, and affected to be listening to the talk.\r\n\r\n\"Worthily matched,\" a rich male voice was saying; \"the two antagonists were well calculated to render the struggle a terrible and uncertain one. General Bol, with unprecedented tenacity, maintained his position as though he were rooted in the very soil. General Milpertuis, with an agility truly superhuman, kept carrying out movements of the most dazzling rapidity around his immovable adversary. The battle continued to be waged with terrible stubbornness. We were all in an agony of suspense....\"\r\n\r\nIt was General d'Esparvieu describing the autumn manoeuvres to a company of breathlessly interested ladies. He was talking well and his audience were delighted. Proceeding to draw a comparison between the French and German methods, he defined their distinguishing characteristics and brought out the conspicuous merits of both with a lofty impartiality. He did not hesitate to affirm that each system had its advantages, and at first made it appear to his circle of wondering, disappointed, and anxious dames, whose countenances were growing increasingly gloomy, that France and Germany were practically in a position of equality. But little by little, as the strategist went on to give a clearer definition of the two methods, that of the French began to appear flexible, elegant, vigorous, full of grace, cleverness, and verve; that of the Germans heavy, clumsy, and undecided. And slowly and surely the faces of the ladies began to clear and to light up with joyous smiles. In order to dissipate any lingering shadows of misgiving from the minds of these wives, sisters, and sweethearts, the General gave them to understand that we were in a position to make use of the German method when it suited us, but that the Germans could not avail themselves of the French method. No sooner had he delivered himself of these sentiments than he was button-holed by Monsieur le Truc de Ruffec, who was engaged in founding a patriotic society known as \"Swordsmen All,\" of which the object was to regenerate France and ensure her superiority over all her adversaries. Even children in the cradle were to be enrolled, and Monsieur le Truc de Ruffec offered the honorary presidency to General d'Esparvieu.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Maurice was appearing to be interested in a conversation that was taking place between a very gentle old lady and the Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Lapetite, Chaplain to the Dames du Saint Sang. The old lady, severely tried of late by illness and the loss of friends, wanted to know how it was that people were unhappy in this world.\r\n\r\n\"How,\" she asked Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Lapetite, \"do you explain the scourges that afflict mankind? Why are there plagues, famines, floods, and earthquakes?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is surely necessary that God should sometimes remind us of his existence,\" replied Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Lapetite, with a heavenly smile.\r\n\r\nMaurice appeared keenly interested in this conversation. Then he seemed fascinated by Madame Fillot-Grandin, quite a personable young woman, whose simple innocence, however, detracted all piquancy from her beauty, all savour from her bodily charms. A very sour, shrill-voiced old lady, who, affecting the dowdy, woollen weeds of poverty, displayed the pride of a great lady in the world of Christian finance, exclaimed in a squeaky voice:\r\n\r\n\"Well, my dear Madame d'Esparvieu, so you have had trouble here. The papers speak darkly of robbery, of thefts committed in Monsieur d'Esparvieu's valuable library, of stolen letters....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said Madame d'Esparvieu, \"if we are to believe all the newspapers say....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, so, dear Madame, you have got your treasures back. All's well that ends well.\"\r\n\r\n\"The library is in perfect order,\" asserted Madame d'Esparvieu. \"There is nothing missing.\"\r\n\r\n\"The library is on the floor above this, is it not?\" asked young Madame des Aubels, showing an unexpected interest in the books.\r\n\r\nMadame d'Esparvieu replied that the library occupied the whole of the second floor, and that they had put the least valuable books in the attics.\r\n\r\n\"Could I not go and look at it?\"\r\n\r\nThe mistress of the house declared that nothing could be easier. She called to her son:\r\n\r\n\"Maurice, go and do the honours of the library to Madame des Aubels.\"\r\n\r\nMaurice rose, and without uttering a word, mounted to the second floor in the wake of Madame des Aubels.\r\n\r\nHe appeared indifferent, but inwardly he rejoiced, for he had no doubt that Gilberte had feigned her ardent desire to inspect the library simply to see him in secret. And, while affecting indifference, he promised himself to renew those offers which, this time, would not be refused.\r\n\r\nUnder the romantic bust of Alexandre d'Esparvieu, they were met by the silent shadow of a little wan, hollow-eyed old man, who wore a settled expression of mute terror.\r\n\r\n\"Do not let us disturb you, Monsieur Sariette,\" said Maurice. \"I am showing Madame des Aubels round the library.\"\r\n\r\nMaurice and Madame des Aubels passed on into the great room where against the four walls rose presses filled with books and surmounted by bronze busts of poets, philosophers, and orators of antiquity. All was in perfect order, an order which seemed never to have been disturbed from the beginning of things.\r\n\r\nOnly, a black void was to be seen in the place which, only the evening before, had been filled by an unpublished manuscript of Richard Simon. Meanwhile, by the side of the young couple walked Monsieur Sariette, pale, faded, and silent.\r\n\r\n\"Really and truly, you have not been nice,\" said Maurice, with a look of reproach at Madame des Aubels.\r\n\r\nShe signed to him that the librarian might over-hear. But he reassured her.\r\n\r\n\"Take no notice. It is old Sariette. He has become a complete idiot.\" And he repeated: \"No, you have not been at all nice. I awaited you. You did not come. You have made me unhappy.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a moment's silence, while one heard the low melancholy whistling of asthma in poor Sariette's bronchial tubes, young Maurice continued insistently:\r\n\r\n\"You are wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wrong not to do as I ask you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you still think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"You meant it seriously?\"\r\n\r\n\"As seriously as can be.\"\r\n\r\nTouched by his assurance of sincere and constant feeling, and thinking she had resisted sufficiently, Gilberte granted to Maurice what she had refused him a fortnight ago.\r\n\r\nThey slipped into an embrasure of the window, behind an enormous celestial globe whereon were graven the Signs of the Zodiac and the figures of the stars, and there, their gaze fixed on the Lion, the Virgin, and the Scales, in the presence of a multitude of Bibles, before the works of the Fathers, both Greek and Latin, beneath the casts of Homer, \\xc3\\x86schylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Herodotus, Thucydides, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Demosthenes, Cicero, Virgil, Horace, Seneca, and Epictetus, they exchanged vows of love and a long kiss on the mouth.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately Madame des Aubels bethought herself that she still had some calls to pay, and that she must make her escape quickly, for love had not made her lose all sense of her own importance. But she had barely crossed the landing with Maurice when they heard a hoarse cry and saw Monsieur Sariette plunge madly downstairs, exclaiming as he went:\r\n\r\n\"Stop it, stop it; I saw it fly away! It escaped from the shelf by itself. It crossed the room ... there it is--there! It's going downstairs. Stop it! It has gone out of the door on the ground floor!\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" asked Maurice.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Sariette looked out of the landing window, murmuring horror-struck:\r\n\r\n\"It's crossing the garden! It's going into the summer-house. Stop it, stop it!\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is it?\" repeated Maurice--\"in God's name, what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"My Flavius Josephus,\" exclaimed Monsieur Sariette. \"Stop it!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he fell down unconscious.\r\n\r\n\"You see he is quite mad,\" said Maurice to Madame des Aubels, as he lifted up the unfortunate librarian.\r\n\r\nGilberte, a little pale, said she also thought she had seen something in the direction indicated by the unhappy man, something flying.\r\n\r\nMaurice had seen nothing, but he had felt what seemed like a gust of wind.\r\n\r\nHe left Monsieur Sariette in the arms of Hippolyte and the housekeeper, who had both hastened to the spot on hearing the noise.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman had a wound in his head.\r\n\r\n\"All the better,\" said the housekeeper; \"this wound may save him from having a fit.\"\r\n\r\nMadame des Aubels gave her handkerchief to stop the blood, and recommended an arnica compress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n     WHEREIN IT IS SHOWN THAT, AS AN ANCIENT GREEK POET SAID,      \"NOTHING IS SWEETER THAN APHRODITE THE GOLDEN\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough he had enjoyed Madame des Aubels' favours for six whole months, Maurice still loved her. True they had had to separate during the summer. For lack of funds of his own he had had to go to Switzerland with his mother, and then to stop with the whole family at the Ch\\xc3\\xa2teau d'Esparvieu. She had spent the summer with her mother at Niort, and the autumn with her husband at a little Normandy seaside place, so that they had hardly seen each other four or five times. But since the winter, kindly to lovers, had brought them back to town again, Maurice had been receiving her twice a week in his little flat in the Rue de Rome, and received no one else. No other woman had inspired him with feelings of such constancy and fidelity. What augmented his pleasure was that he believed himself loved, and indeed he was not unpleasing.\r\n\r\nHe thought that she did not deceive him, not that he had any reason to think so, but it appeared right and fitting that she should be content with him alone. What annoyed him was that she always kept him waiting, and was unpunctual in coming to their meeting-place; she was invariably late,--at times very late.\r\n\r\nNow on Saturday, January 30th, since four o'clock in the afternoon, Maurice had been awaiting Madame des Aubels in the little pink room, where a bright fire was burning. He was gaily clad in a suit of flowered pyjamas, smoking Turkish cigarettes. At first he dreamt of receiving her with long kisses, with hitherto unknown caresses. A quarter of an hour having passed, he meditated serious and affectionate reproaches, then after an hour of disappointed waiting he vowed he would meet her with cold disdain.\r\n\r\nAt length she appeared, fresh and fragrant.\r\n\r\n\"It was scarcely worth while coming,\" he said bitterly, as she laid her muff and her little bag on the table and untied her veil before the wardrobe mirror.\r\n\r\nNever, she told her beloved, had she had such trouble to get away. She was full of excuses, which he obstinately rejected. But no sooner had she the good sense to hold her tongue than he ceased his reproaches, and then nothing detracted from the longing with which she inspired him.\r\n\r\nThe curtains were drawn, the room was bathed in warm shadows lit by the dancing gleams of the fire. The mirrors in the wardrobe and on the chimney-piece shone with mysterious lights. Gilberte, leaning on her elbow, head on hand, was lost in thought. A little jeweller, a trustworthy and intelligent man, had shown her a wonderfully pretty pearl and sapphire bracelet; it was worth a great deal, and was to be had for a mere nothing. He had got it from a _cocotte_ down on her luck, who was in a hurry to dispose of it. It was a rare chance; it would be a huge pity to let it slip.\r\n\r\n\"Would you like to see it, darling? I will ask the little man to let me have it to show you.\"\r\n\r\nMaurice did not actually decline the proposal. But it was clear that he took no interest in the wonderful bracelet. \"When small jewellers come across a great bargain, they keep it to themselves, and do not allow their customers to profit by it. Moreover, jewellery means nothing just now. Well-bred women have given up wearing it. Everyone goes in for sport, and jewellery does not go with sport.\"\r\n\r\nMaurice spoke thus, contrary to truth, because having given his mistress a fur coat, he was in no hurry to give her anything more. He was not stingy, but he was careful with his money. His people did not give him a very large allowance, and his debts grew bigger every day. By satisfying the wishes of his inamorata too promptly he feared to arouse others still more pressing. The bargain seemed less wonderful to him than to Gilberte; besides, he liked to take the initiative in choosing his gifts. Above all, he thought that if he gave her too many presents he would be no longer sure of being loved for himself.\r\n\r\nMadame des Aubels felt neither contempt nor surprise at this attitude; she was gentle and temperate, she knew men, and judged that one must take them as one found them, that for the most part they do not give very willingly, and that a woman should know how to make them give.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a gas lamp was lighted in the street, and shone through the gaps in the curtains.\r\n\r\n\"Half-past six,\" she said. \"We must be on the move.\"\r\n\r\nPricked by the touch of Time's fleeting wing, Maurice was conscious of reawakened desires and reanimated powers. A white and radiant offering, Gilberte, with her head thrown back, her eyes half closed, her lips apart, sunk in dreamy languor, was breathing slowly and placidly, when suddenly she started up with a cry of terror.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay still,\" said Maurice, holding her back in his arms.\r\n\r\nIn his present mood, had the sky fallen it would not have troubled him. But in one bound she escaped from him. Crouching down, her eyes filled with terror, she was pointing with her finger at a figure which appeared in a corner of the room, between the fire-place and the wardrobe with the mirror. Then, unable to bear the sight, and nearly fainting, she hid her face in her hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n     WHICH FAR SURPASSES IN AUDACITY THE IMAGINATIVE FLIGHTS OF      DANTE AND MILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nMaurice at length turned his head, saw the figure, and perceiving that it moved, was also frightened. Meanwhile, Gilberte was regaining her senses. She imagined that what she had seen was some mistress whom her lover had hidden in the room. Inflamed with anger and disgust at the idea of such treachery, boiling with indignation, and glaring at her supposed rival, she exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"A woman ... a naked woman too! You bring me into a room where you allow your women to come, and when I arrive they have not had time to dress. And you reproach me with arriving late! Your impudence is beyond belief! Come, send the creature packing. If you wanted us both here together, you might at least have asked me whether it suited me....\"\r\n\r\nMaurice, wide-eyed and groping for a revolver that had never been there, whispered in her ear:\r\n\r\n\"Be quiet ... it is no woman. One can scarcely see, but it is more like a man.\"\r\n\r\nShe put her hands over her eyes again and screamed harder than ever.\r\n\r\n\"A man! Where does he come from? A thief. An assassin! Help! Help! Kill him.... Maurice, kill him! Turn on the light. No, don't turn on the light....\"\r\n\r\nShe made a mental vow that should she escape from this danger she would burn a candle to the Blessed Virgin. Her teeth chattered.\r\n\r\nThe figure made a movement.\r\n\r\n\"Keep away!\" cried Gilberte. \"Keep away!\"\r\n\r\nShe offered the burglar all the money and jewels she had on the table if he would consent not to stir. Amid her surprise and terror the idea assailed her that her husband, dissembling his suspicions, had caused her to be followed, had posted witnesses, and had had recourse to the Commissaire de Police. In a flash she distinctly saw before her the long painful future, the glaring scandal, the pretended disdain, the cowardly desertion of her friends, the just mockery of society, for it is indeed ridiculous to be found out. She saw the divorce, the loss of her position and of her rank. She saw the dreary and narrow existence with her mother, when no one would make love to her, for men avoid women who fail to give them the security of the married state. And all this, why? Why this ruin, this disaster? For a piece of folly, for a mere nothing. Thus in a lightning flash spoke the conscience of Gilberte des Aubels.\r\n\r\n\"Have no fear, Madame,\" said a very sweet voice.\r\n\r\nSlightly reassured, she found strength to ask:\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am an angel,\" replied the voice.\r\n\r\n\"What did you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am an angel. I am Maurice's guardian angel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say it again. I am going mad. I do not understand....\"\r\n\r\nMaurice, without understanding either, was indignant. He sprang forward and showed himself; with his right hand armed with a slipper he made a threatening gesture, and said in a rough voice:\r\n\r\n\"You are a low ruffian; oblige me by going the way you came.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maurice d'Esparvieu,\" continued the sweet voice, \"He whom you adore as your Creator has stationed by the side of each of the faithful a good angel, whose mission it is to counsel and protect him; it is the invariable opinion of the Fathers, it is founded on many passages in the Bible, the Church admits it unanimously, without, however, pronouncing anathema upon those who hold a contrary opinion. You see before you one of these angels, yours, Maurice. I was commanded to watch over your innocence and to guard your chastity.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be,\" said Maurice; \"but you are certainly no gentleman. A gentleman would not permit himself to enter a room at such a moment. To be plain, what the deuce are you doing here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have assumed this appearance, Maurice, because, having henceforth to move among mankind, I have to make myself like them. The celestial spirits possess the power of assuming a form which renders them apparent to the eye and to the touch. This shape is real, because it is apparent, and all the realities in the world are but appearances.\"\r\n\r\nGilberte, pacified at length, was arranging her hair on her forehead.\r\n\r\nThe Angel pursued:\r\n\r\n\"The celestial spirits adopt, according to their fancy, one sex or the other, or both at once. But they cannot disguise themselves at any moment, according to their caprice or fantasy. Their metamorphoses are subject to constant laws, which you would not understand. Thus I have neither desire nor power to transform myself under your eyes, for your amusement or my own, into a lion, a tiger, a fly, or into a sycamore-shaving like the young Egyptian whose story was found in a tomb. I cannot change myself into an ass as did Lucius with the pomade of the youthful Photis. For in my wisdom I had fixed beforehand the hour of my apparition to mankind, nothing could hasten or delay it.\"\r\n\r\nImpatient for enlightenment, Maurice asked for the second time:\r\n\r\n\"Still, what are you up to here?\"\r\n\r\nJoining her voice to his, Madame des Aubels asked: \"Yes, indeed, what are you doing here?\"\r\n\r\nThe Angel replied:\r\n\r\n\"Man, lend your ear. Woman, hear my voice. I am about to reveal to you a secret on which hangs the fate of the Universe. In rebellion against Him whom you hold to be the Creator of all things visible and invisible, I am preparing the Revolt of the Angels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not jest,\" said Maurice, who had faith and did not allow holy things to be played with.\r\n\r\nBut the Angel answered reproachfully: \"What makes you think, Maurice, that I am frivolous and given to vain words?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, come,\" said Maurice, shrugging his shoulders. \"You are not going to revolt against----\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the ceiling--not daring to finish.\r\n\r\nBut the Angel continued:\r\n\r\n\"Do you not know that the sons of God have already revolted and that a great battle took place in the heavens?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was a long time ago,\" said Maurice, putting on his socks.\r\n\r\nThen the Angel replied:\r\n\r\n\"It was before the creation of the world. But nothing has changed since then in the heavens. The nature of the Angels is no different now from what it was originally. What they did then they could do again now.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! It is not possible. It is contrary to faith. If you were an angel, a good angel as you make out you are, it would never occur to you to disobey your Creator.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are in error, Maurice, and the authority of the Fathers condemns you. Origen lays it down in his homilies that good angels are fallible, that they sin every day and fall from Heaven like flies. Possibly you may be tempted to reject the authority of this Father, despite his knowledge of the Scriptures, because he is excluded from the Canon of the Saints. If this be so, I would remind you of the second chapter of Revelation, in which the Angels of Ephesus and Pergamos are rebuked for that they kept not ward over their church. You will doubtless contend that the angels to whom the Apostle here refers are, properly speaking, the Bishops of the two cities in question, and that he calls them angels on account of their ministry. It may be so, and I cede the point. But with what arguments, Maurice, would you counter the opinion of all those Doctors and Pontiffs whose unanimous teaching it is that angels may fall from good into evil? Such is the statement made by Saint Jerome in his Epistle to Damasus....\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur,\" said Madame des Aubels, \"go away, I beg you.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Angel hearkened not, and continued:\r\n\r\n\"Saint Augustine, in his _True Religion_, Chapter XIII; Saint Gregory, in his _Morals_, Chapter XXIV; Isidore----\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur, let me get my things on; I am in a hurry.\"\r\n\r\n\"In his treatise on _The Greatest Good_, Book I, Chapter XII; Bede on Job----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, please, Monsieur ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Chapter VIII; John of Damascus on _Faith_, Book II, Chapter III. Those, I think, are sufficiently weighty authorities, and there is nothing for it, Maurice, but to admit your error. What has led you astray is that you have not duly considered my nature, which is free, active, and mobile, like that of all the angels, and that you have merely observed the grace and felicity with which you deem me so richly endowed. Lucifer possessed no less, yet he rebelled.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what on earth are you rebelling for?\" asked Maurice.\r\n\r\n\"Isaiah,\" answered the child of light, \"Isaiah has already asked, before you: '_Quomodo cecidisti de coelo, Lucifer, qui mane oriebaris?_' Hearken, Maurice. Before Time was, the Angels rose up to win dominion over Heaven, the most beautiful of the Seraphim revolted through pride. As for me, it is science that has inspired me with the generous desire for freedom. Finding myself near you, Maurice, in a house containing one of the vastest libraries in the world, I acquired a taste for reading and a love of study. While, fordone with the toils of a sensual life, you lay sunk in heavy slumber, I surrounded myself with books, I studied, I pondered over their pages, sometimes in one of the rooms of the library, under the busts of the great men of antiquity, sometimes at the far end of the garden, in the room in the summer-house next to your own.\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing these words, young d'Esparvieu exploded with laughter and beat the pillow with his fist, an infallible sign of uncontrollable mirth.\r\n\r\n\"Ah ... ah ... ah! It was you who pillaged papa's library and drove poor old Sariette off his head. You know, he has become completely idiotic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Busily engaged,\" continued the Angel, \"in cultivating for myself a sovereign intelligence, I paid no heed to that inferior being, and when he thought to offer obstacles to my researches and to disturb my work I punished him for his importunity.\r\n\r\n\"One particular winter's night in the abode of the philosophers and globes I let fall a volume of great weight on his head, which he tried to tear from my invisible hand. Then more recently, raising, with a vigorous arm composed of a column of condensed air, a precious manuscript of Flavius Josephus, I gave the imbecile such a fright, that he rushed out screaming on to the landing and (to borrow a striking expression from Dante Alighieri) fell even as a dead body falls. He was well rewarded, for you gave him, Madame, to staunch the blood from his wound, your little scented handkerchief. It was the day, you may remember, when behind a celestial globe you exchanged a kiss on the mouth with Maurice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur,\" said Madame des Aubels, with a frown, \"I cannot allow you....\"\r\n\r\nBut she stopped short, deeming it was an inopportune moment to appear over-exacting on a matter of decorum.\r\n\r\n\"I had made up my mind,\" continued the Angel impassively, \"to examine the foundations of belief. I first attacked the monuments of Judaism, and I read all the Hebrew texts.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know Hebrew, then?\" exclaimed Maurice.\r\n\r\n\"Hebrew is my native tongue: in Paradise for a long time we have spoken nothing else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you are a Jew. I might have deduced it from your want of tact.\"\r\n\r\nThe Angel, not deigning to hear, continued in his melodious voice: \"I have delved deep into Oriental antiquities and also into those of Greece and Rome. I have devoured the works of theologians, philosophers, physicists, geologists, and naturalists. I have learnt. I have thought. I have lost my faith.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? You no longer believe in God?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe in Him, since my existence depends on His, and if He should fail to exist, I myself should fall into nothingness. I believe in Him, even as the Satyrs and the M\\xc3\\xa6nads believed in Dionysus and for the same reason. I believe in the God of the Jews and the Christians. But I deny that He created the world; at the most He organised but an inferior part of it, and all that He touched bears the mark of His rough and unforeseeing touch. I do not think He is either eternal or infinite, for it is absurd to conceive of a being who is not bounded by space or time. I think Him limited, even very limited. I no longer believe Him to be the only God. For a long time He did not believe it Himself; in the beginning He was a polytheist; later, His pride and the flattery of His worshippers made Him a monotheist. His ideas have little connection; He is less powerful than He is thought to be. And, to speak candidly, He is not so much a god as a vain and ignorant demiurge. Those who, like myself, know His true nature, call Him Ialdabaoth.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ialdabaoth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ialdabaoth. What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have already told you. It is the demiurge whom, in your blindness, you adore as the one and only God.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're mad. I don't advise you to go and talk rubbish like that to Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Patouille.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not in the least sanguine, my dear Maurice, of piercing the dense night of your intellect. I merely tell you that I am going to engage Ialdabaoth in conflict with some hopes of victory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mark my words, you won't succeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lucifer shook His throne, and the issue was for a moment in doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Abdiel for the angels and saints, Arcade for mankind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my poor Arcade, I regret to see you going to the bad. But confess that you are jesting with us. I could at a pinch understand your leaving Heaven for a woman. Love makes us commit the greatest follies. But you will never make me believe that you, who have seen God face to face, ultimately found the truth in old Sariette's musty books. No, you will never get me to believe that!\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Maurice, Lucifer was face to face with God, yet he refused to serve Him. As to the kind of truth one finds in books, it is a truth that enables us sometimes to discern what things are not, without ever enabling us to discover what they are. And this poor little truth has sufficed to prove to me that He in whom I blindly believed is not believable, and that men and angels have been deceived by the lies of Ialdabaoth.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no Ialdabaoth. There is God. Come, Arcade, do the right thing. Renounce these follies, these impieties, dis-incarnate yourself, become once more a pure Spirit, and resume your office of guardian angel. Return to duty. I forgive you, but do not let us see you again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like to please you, Maurice. I feel a certain affection for you, for my heart is soft. But fate henceforth calls me elsewhere towards beings capable of thought and action.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Arcade,\" said Madame des Aubels, \"withdraw, I implore you. It makes me horribly shy to be in this position before two men. I assure you I am not accustomed to it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n     RECOUNTS IN WHAT MANNER THE ANGEL, ATTIRED IN THE CAST-OFF      GARMENTS OF A SUICIDE, LEAVES THE YOUTHFUL MAURICE WITHOUT A      HEAVENLY GUARDIAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Reassure yourself, Madame,\" replied the apparition, \"your position is not as risky as you say. You are not confronted with two men, but with one man and an angel.\"\r\n\r\nShe examined the stranger with an eye which, piercing the gloom, was anxiously surveying a vague but by no means negligible indication, and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur, is it quite certain that you are an angel?\"\r\n\r\nThe apparition prayed her to have no doubt about it, and gave some precise information as to his origin.\r\n\r\n\"There are three hierarchies of celestial spirits, each composed of nine choirs; the first comprises the Seraphim, Cherubim, and the Thrones; the second, the Dominations, the Virtues, and the Powers; the third, the Principalities, the Archangels, and the Angels properly so called. I belong to the ninth choir of the third hierarchy.\"\r\n\r\nMadame des Aubels, who had her reasons for doubting this, expressed at least one:\r\n\r\n\"You have no wings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should I, Madame? Am I bound to resemble the angels on your holy-water stoups? Those feathery oars that beat the waves of the air in rhythmic cadences are not always worn by the heavenly messengers on their shoulders. Cherubim may be apterous. That all too beautiful angelic pair who spent an anxious night in the house of Lot compassed about by an Oriental horde--they had no wings! No, they appeared just like men, and the dust of the road covered their feet, which the patriarch washed with pious hand. I would beg you to observe, Madame, that according to the Science of Organic Metamorphosis created by Lamarck and Darwin, the wings of birds have been successively transformed into fore-feet in the case of quadrupeds and into arms in the case of the Linn\\xc3\\xa6an primates. And you may remember, Maurice, that by a rather annoying reversion to type, Miss Kate, your English nurse, who used to be so fond of giving you a whipping, had arms very like the pinions of a plucked fowl. One may say, then, that a being possessing both arms and wings is a monster and belongs to the department of Teratology. In Paradise we have Cherubim and Ker\\xc3\\xbbbs in the shape of winged bulls, but those are the clumsy inventions of an inartistic god. It is nevertheless true, quite true, that the Victories of the Temple of Athena Nike on the Athenian Acropolis are beautiful, and possess both arms and wings; it is also true that the Victory of Brescia is beautiful, with her outstretched arms and her long wings folded on her mighty loins. It is one of the miracles of Greek genius to have known how to create harmonious monsters. The Greeks never err. The Moderns always.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet on the whole,\" said Madame des Aubels, \"you have not the look of a pure Spirit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, I am one, Madame, if ever there was one. And it ill becomes you, who have been baptised, to doubt it. Several of the Fathers, such as St. Justin, Tertullian, Origen, and Clement of Alexandria thought that the Angels were not purely spiritual, but possessed a body formed of some subtile material. This opinion has been rejected by the Church; hence I am merely Spirit. But what is spirit and what is matter? Formerly they were contrasted as being two opposites, and now your human science tends to reunite them as two aspects of the same thing. It teaches that everything proceeds from ether and everything returns to it, that the same movement transforms the waves of air into stones and minerals, and that the atoms scattered throughout illimitable space, form, by the varying speed of their orbits, all the substance of this material world.\"\r\n\r\nBut Madame des Aubels was not listening. She had something on her mind, and to put an end to her suspense, she asked:\r\n\r\n\"How long have you been here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I came with Maurice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--that's a nice thing!\" said she, shaking her head. But the Angel continued with heavenly serenity:\r\n\r\n\"Everything in the Universe is circular, elliptical, or hyperbolic, and the same laws which rule the stars govern this grain of dust. In the original and native movement of its substance, my body is spiritual, but it may affect, as you perceive, this material state, by changing the rhythm of its elements.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus spoken he sat down in a chair on Madame des Aubels' black stockings.\r\n\r\nA clock struck outside.\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens, seven o'clock!\" exclaimed Gilberte. \"What am I to say to my husband? He thinks I am at that tea-party in the Rue de Rivoli. We are dining with the La Verdeli\\xc3\\xa8res to-night. Go away immediately, Monsieur Arcade. I must get ready to go. I have not a second to lose.\"\r\n\r\nThe Angel replied that he would have willingly obeyed Madame des Aubels had he been in a state to show himself decently in public, but that he could not dream of appearing out of doors without any clothes. \"Were I to walk naked in the street,\" he added, \"I should offend a nation attached to its ancient habits, habits which it has never examined. They are the basis of all moral systems. Formerly,\" he added, \"the angels, in revolt like myself, manifested themselves to Christians under grotesque and ridiculous appearances, black, horned, hairy, and cloven-footed. Pure stupidity! They were the laughing-stock of people of taste. They merely frightened old women and children and met with no success.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true he cannot go out as he is,\" said Madame des Aubels with justice.\r\n\r\nMaurice tossed his pyjamas and his slippers to the celestial messenger. Regarded as outdoor habiliments they were not adequate. Gilberte pressed her lover to run at once in quest of other clothes. He proposed to go and get some from the concierge. She was violently opposed to this. It would, she said, be madly imprudent to drag the concierge into such an affair.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want them to know that ...\" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nShe pointed to the Angel and was silent.\r\n\r\nYoung d'Esparvieu went out to seek a clothes-shop.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Gilberte, who could not delay any longer for fear of causing a horrible society scandal, turned on the light and dressed before the Angel. She did it without any awkwardness, for she knew how to adapt herself to circumstances; and she took it that in such an unheard-of encounter in which heaven and earth were mingled in unutterable confusion it was permissible to retrench in modesty.\r\n\r\nMoreover, she knew that she possessed a good figure and had garments as dainty as the fashion demanded. As the apparition's sense of delicacy would not permit him to don Maurice's pyjamas, Gilberte could not help observing by the lamp-light that her suspicions were well-founded, and that angels have the same appearance as men. Curious to know if the appearance were real or imaginary she asked the child of light if Angels were like monkeys, who, to win women, merely lack money.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Gilberte,\" replied Arcade, \"Angels are capable of loving mortals. It is the teaching of the Scriptures. It is said in the Seventh Book of Genesis, 'When men became numerous on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them, the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they took as wives all those which pleased them.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens,\" cried Gilberte all at once, \"I shall never be able to fasten my dress; it hooks down the back.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Maurice entered the room he found the Angel on his knees tying the shoes of the woman taken in _flagrante delicto_.\r\n\r\nTaking her muff and her bag off the table she said:\r\n\r\n\"I have not forgotten anything? No. Good-night, Monsieur Arcade. Good-night, Maurice. I shall not forget to-day.\" And she vanished like a dream.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" said Maurice, throwing the Angel a bundle of clothes.\r\n\r\nThe young man, having seen some dismal rags lying among clarionettes and clyster-pipes in the window of a second-hand shop, had bought for nineteen francs the cast-off suit of some wretched sable-clad mortal who had committed suicide. The Angel, with native majesty, took the garments and put them on. Worn by him, they took on an unexpected elegance. He took a step to the door.\r\n\r\n\"So you are leaving me,\" said Maurice. \"It's settled, then? I very much fear that, some day, you will bitterly regret this hasty action.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must not look back. Adieu, Maurice.\"\r\n\r\nMaurice timidly slipped five louis into his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Adieu, Arcade.\"\r\n\r\nBut when the Angel had passed through the door, and all that was to be seen of him in the door-way was his uplifted heel, Maurice called him back.\r\n\r\n\"Arcade! I never thought of it! I have no guardian angel now!\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite true, Maurice, you have one no longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what will become of me? One must have a guardian angel. Tell me,--are there not grave drawbacks,--is there no danger in not having one?\"\r\n\r\n\"Before replying, Maurice, I must ask you if you wish me to speak to you according to your belief, which formerly was my own, according to the teaching of the Church and the Catholic faith, or according to natural philosophy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care a straw for your natural philosophy. Answer me according to the religion I believe in, and which I profess, and in which I wish to live and die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, my dear Maurice. The loss of your guardian angel will probably deprive you of certain spiritual succour, of certain celestial grace. I am expressing to you the unvarying opinion of the Church on the matter. You will lack an assistance, a support, a consolation which would have guided and confirmed you in the way of salvation. You will have less strength to avoid sin, and as it was you hadn't much. In fact, in spiritual matters, you will be without strength and without joy. Adieu, Maurice; when you see Madame des Aubels, please remember me to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are going?\"\r\n\r\n\"Farewell.\"\r\n\r\nArcade disappeared, and Maurice in the depths of an arm-chair sat for a long time with his head in his hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n     WHEREIN IT IS SET FORTH HOW THE ANGEL MIRAR, WHEN BEARING      GRACE AND CONSOLATION TO THOSE DWELLING IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD      OF THE CHAMPS \\xc3\\x89LYS\\xc3\\x89ES IN PARIS, BEHELD A MUSIC-HALL SINGER      NAMED BOUCHOTTE AND FELL IN LOVE WITH HER\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough streets filled with brown fog, pierced with white and yellow lights, where horses exhaled their smoking breath and motors radiated their rapid search-lights, the angel made his way, and, mingling with the black flood of foot-passengers which rolled unceasingly along, proceeded across the town from north to south till he came to the lonely boulevards on the left bank of the river. Not far from the old walls of Port Royal, a small restaurant flings night by night athwart the pavement the clouded rays of its streaming windows. Coming to a halt there, Arcade entered a room full of warm, savoury odours, pleasing to the unfortunate beings faint with cold and hunger. Glancing round him he beheld Russian Nihilists, Italian Anarchists, refugees, conspirators, revolutionaries from every quarter of the globe, picturesque old faces with tumbled masses of hair and beard that swept downwards even as the torrent and the waterfall sweep over their rocky bed. There were young faces of virginal coldness, expressions sombre and wild, pale eyes of infinite sweetness, drawn faces, and, in a corner, there were two Russian women, one extremely lovely, the other hideous, but both resembling each other in their indifference to ugliness and to beauty. But failing to find the face he sought, for there were no angels in the room, he sat down at a small vacant marble table.\r\n\r\nAngels, when driven by hunger, eat as do the animals of this earth, and their food, transformed by digestive heat, becomes one with their celestial substance. Seeing three angels under the oaks of Mamre, Abraham offered them cakes, kneaded by Sarah, an whole calf, butter and milk, and they ate. Lot, on receiving two angels in his house, ordered unleavened bread to be baked, and they did eat. Arcade was given a tough beef-steak by a seedy waiter, and he did eat. Nevertheless, his dreams were of the sweet leisure, of the repose, of the delightful studies he had quitted, of the heavy task he had undertaken, of the toil, the weariness, the perils which he would have to endure, and his soul was sad and his heart troubled.\r\n\r\nAs he was finishing his modest repast, a young man of poor appearance and thinly clad entered the room, and rapidly surveying the tables approached the angel and greeted him by the name of Abdiel, because he himself was a celestial spirit.\r\n\r\n\"I knew you would answer my call, Mirar,\" replied Arcade, addressing his angelic brother in his turn by the name he formerly bore in heaven. But Mirar was remembered no more in heaven since he, an Archangel, had left the service of God. He was called Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile Belais on earth, and to earn his bread gave music lessons to small children in the day-time and at night played the violin in dancing saloons.\r\n\r\n\"It is you, dear Abdiel?\" replied Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile. \"So here we are reunited in this sad world. I am pleased to see you again. All the same I pity you, for we lead a hard life here.\"\r\n\r\nBut Arcade answered:\r\n\r\n\"Friend, your exile draws to an end. I have great plans. I will confide them to you and associate you with them.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Maurice's guardian angel, having ordered two coffees, revealed his ideas and his projects to his companion: he told how, during his visit on earth, he had abandoned himself to researches little practised by celestial spirits and had studied theologies, cosmogonies, the system of the Universe, theories of matter, modern essays on the transformation and loss of energy. Having, he explained, studied Nature, he had found her in perpetual conflict with the teachings of the Master he served. This Master, greedy of praise, whom he had for a long time adored, appeared to him now as an ignorant, stupid, and cruel tyrant. He had denied Him, blasphemed Him, and was burning to combat Him. His plan was to recommence the revolt of the angels. He wished for war, and hoped for victory.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" he added, \"it is necessary above all to know our strength and that of our adversary.\" And he asked if the enemies of Ialdabaoth were numerous and powerful on earth.\r\n\r\nTh\\xc3\\xa9ophile looked wonderingly at his brother. He appeared not to understand the questions addressed him.\r\n\r\n\"Dear compatriot,\" he said, \"I came at your invitation because it was the invitation of an old comrade. But I do not know what you expect of me, and I fear I shall be unable to help you in anything. I take no hand in politics, neither do I stand forth as a reformer. I am not like you, a spirit in revolt, a freethinker, a revolutionary. I remain faithful, in the depths of my soul, to the Celestial Creator. I still adore the Master I no longer serve, and I lament the days when shrouding myself with my wings I formed with the multitude of the children of light a wheel of flame around His throne of glory. Love, profane love has alone separated me from God. I quitted heaven to follow a daughter of men. She was beautiful and sang in music-halls.\"\r\n\r\nThey rose. Arcade accompanied Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile, who was living at the other end of the town, at the corner of the Boulevard Rochechouart and the Rue de Steinkerque. While walking through the deserted streets he who loved the singer told his brother of his love and his sorrows.\r\n\r\nHis fall, which dated from two years back, had been sudden. Belonging to the eighth choir of the third hierarchy he was a bearer of grace to the faithful who are still to be found in large numbers in France, especially among the higher ranks of the officers of the army and navy.\r\n\r\n\"One summer night,\" he said, \"as I was descending from Heaven, to distribute consolations, the grace of perseverance and of good deaths to divers pious persons in the neighbourhood of the \\xc3\\x89toile, my eyes, although well accustomed to immortal light, were dazzled by the fiery flowers with which the Champs \\xc3\\x89lys\\xc3\\xa9es were sown. Great candelabra, under the trees, marking the entrances to caf\\xc3\\xa9s and restaurants, gave the foliage the precious glitter of an emerald. Long garlands of luminous pearl surrounded the open-air enclosures where a crowd of men and women sat closely packed listening to the sounds of a lively orchestra, whose strains reached my ears confusedly.\r\n\r\n\"The night was warm, my wings were beginning to grow tired. I descended into one of the concerts and sat down, invisible, among the audience. At this moment, a woman appeared on the stage, clad in a short spangled frock. Owing to the reflection of the footlights and the paint on her face all that was visible of the latter was the expression and the smile. Her body was supple and voluptuous.\r\n\r\n\"She sang and danced.... Arcade, I have always loved dancing and music, but this creature's thrilling voice and insidious movements created in me an uneasiness I had never known before. My colour came and went. My eyelids drooped, my tongue clove to my mouth. I could not leave the spot.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile related, groaning, how, possessed by desire for this woman, he did not return to Heaven again, but, taking the shape of a man, lived an earthly life, for it is written: \"In those days the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nA fallen angel, having lost his innocence along with the vision of God, Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile at heart still retained his simplicity of soul. Clad in rags, filched from the stall of a Jewish hawker, he went to seek the woman he loved. She was called Bouchotte and lodged in a small house in Montmartre. He flung himself at her feet and told her she was adorable, that she sang delightfully, that he loved her madly, that, for her, he would renounce his family and his country, that he was a musician and had nothing to eat. Touched by such youthful ingenuousness, candour, poverty, and love, she fed, clothed, and loved him.\r\n\r\nHowever, after long and painful struggles, he procured employment as a music-teacher, and made some money, which he brought to his mistress, keeping nothing for himself. From that time forward she loved him no longer. She despised him for earning so little and did not conceal her indifference, weariness, and disgust. She overwhelmed him with reproaches, irony, and abuse, in spite of which she kept him, for she had had experience of worse partners and was used to domestic quarrels. For the rest, she led a busy, serious, and rather hard life as artist and woman. Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile loved her as he had loved her the first night, and he suffered.\r\n\r\n\"She overworks herself,\" he told his celestial brother, \"that is what makes her so hard to please, but I am certain she loves me. I hope soon to give her more comfort.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he spoke at length of an operetta at which he was working and which he hoped to have brought out at a Paris theatre. A young poet had given him the libretto. It was the story of Aline, queen of Golconda, after an eighteenth-century tale.\r\n\r\n\"I am strewing it profusely with melodies,\" said Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile; \"my music comes from my heart. My heart is an inexhaustible source of melody. Unfortunately nowadays people like recondite arrangements, difficult scoring. They accuse me of being too fluid, too limpid, of not imparting enough colour to my style, not aiming at stronger effects in harmony and more vigorous contrasts. Harmony, harmony!... No doubt it has given its merits, but it does not appeal to the heart. It is melody which carries us away and ravishes us and brings smiles and tears to our eyes.\" At these words he smiled and wept to himself. Then he continued with emotion:\r\n\r\n\"I am a fountain of melody. But the orchestration! there's the rub! In Paradise, you know, Arcade, in the matter of instruments, we only possess the harp, the psaltery, and the hydraulic organ.\"\r\n\r\nArcade was only listening to him with half an ear. He was meditating plans which filled his soul and swelled his heart.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know any angels in revolt?\" he asked his companion. \"As for me, I know only one, Prince Istar, with whom I have exchanged a few letters and who offered to share his attic with me while I was finding a lodging in this town, where I believe rents are very high.\"\r\n\r\nOf angels in revolt Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile knew none. When he met a fallen spirit who had formerly been one of his comrades he shook him by the hand, for he was a faithful friend. Sometimes he saw Prince Istar. But he avoided all those bad angels who shocked him by the violence of their opinions and whose conversations plagued him to death.\r\n\r\n\"Then you don't approve of me?\" asked the impulsive Arcade.\r\n\r\n\"Friend, I neither approve of you nor blame you. I understand nothing of the ideas which trouble you. Neither do I think it good for an artist to concern himself with politics. One has quite sufficient to occupy oneself with one's art.\"\r\n\r\nHe loved his profession, and had hopes of \"arriving\" one day, but theatrical ways disgusted him. The only chance he saw of having his piece played was to take one or two--perhaps three--collaborators, who, without having done any work, would sign their names and share the profits. Soon Bouchotte would fail to find engagements. When she offered her services in some small hall the manager began by asking her how many shares she was taking in the business. Such customs, thought Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile, were deplorable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n     WHEREIN WE HEAR THE BEAUTIFUL ARCHANGEL ZITA UNFOLD HER      LOFTY DESIGNS AND ARE SHOWN THE WINGS OF MIRAR, ALL      MOTH-EATEN, IN A CUPBOARD\r\n\r\n\r\nThus talking, the two archangels had reached the Boulevard Rochechouart. As his eye lighted on a tavern, whence, through the mist, the light fell golden on the pavement, Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile suddenly bethought himself of the Archangel Ithuriel who, in the guise of a poor but beautiful woman, was living in wretched lodgings on La Butte and came every evening to read the papers at this tavern. The musician often met her there. Her name was Zita. Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile had never been curious enough to enquire into the opinions entertained by this archangel, but it was generally supposed that she was a Russian nihilist, and he took her to be, like Arcade, an atheist and a revolutionary. He had heard remarkable tales about her. People said she was an hermaphrodite, and that as the active and passive principles were united within her in a condition of stable equilibrium, she was an example of a perfect being, finding in herself complete and continuous satisfaction, contented yet unfortunate in that she knew not desire.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" added Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile, \"I have my doubts about it. I believe she's a woman and subject to love, like everything else that has life and breath in the Universe. Besides, someone caught her one day kissing her hand to a strapping peasant fellow.\"\r\n\r\nHe offered to introduce his companion to her.\r\n\r\nThe two angels found her alone, reading. As they drew near she lifted her great eyes in whose deeps of molten gold little sparks of light were forever a-dance. Her brows were contracted into that austere fold which we see on the forehead of the Pythian Apollo; her nose was perfect and descended without a curve; her lips were compressed and imparted a disdainful and supercilious air to her whole countenance. Her tawny hair, with its gleaming lights, was carelessly adorned with the tattered remnants of a huge bird of prey, her garments lay about her in dark and shapeless folds. She was leaning her chin on a small ill-tended hand.\r\n\r\nArcade, who had but recently heard references made to this powerful archangel, showed her marked esteem, and placed entire confidence in her. He immediately proceeded to tell of the progress his mind had made towards knowledge and liberty, of his lucubrations in the d'Esparvieu library, of his philosophical reading, his studies of nature, his works on exegesis, his anger and his contempt when he recognised the deception of the demiurge, his voluntary exile among mankind, and, finally, of his project to stir up rebellion in Heaven. Ready to dare all against an odious master, whom he pursued with inextinguishable hatred, he expressed his profound happiness at finding in Ithuriel a mind capable of counselling and helping him in his great undertaking.\r\n\r\n\"You are not a very old hand at revolutions,\" said Zita, smiling.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, she doubted neither his sincerity nor the firmness of his declared resolve, and she congratulated him on his intellectual audacity.\r\n\r\n\"That is what is most lacking in our people,\" she said, \"they do not think.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she added almost immediately: \"But on what can intelligence sharpen its wits, in a country where the climate is soft and existence made easy? Even here, where necessity calls for intellectual activity, nothing is rarer than a person who thinks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless,\" replied Maurice's guardian angel, \"man has created science. The important thing is to introduce it into Heaven. When the angels possess some notions of physics, chemistry, astronomy, and physiology; when the study of matter shows them worlds in an atom, and an atom in the myriads of planets; when they see themselves lost between these two infinities; when they weigh and measure the stars, analyse their composition, and calculate their orbits, they will recognise that these monsters work in obedience to forces which no intelligence can define, or that each star has its particular divinity, or indigenous god; and they will realise that the gods of Aldebaran, Betelgeuse, and Sirius are greater than Ialdabaoth. When at length they come to scrutinise with care the little world in which their lot is cast, and, piercing the crust of the earth, note the gradual evolution of its flora and fauna and the rude origin of man, who, under the shelter of rocks and in cave dwellings, had no God but himself; when they discover that, united by the bonds of universal kinship to plants, beasts, and men, they have successively indued all forms of organic life, from the simplest and the most primitive, until they became at length the most beautiful of the children of light, they will perceive that Ialdabaoth, the obscure demon of an insignificant world lost in space, is imposing on their credulity when he pretends that they issued from nothingness at his bidding; they will perceive that he lies in calling himself the Infinite, the Eternal, the Almighty, and that, so far from having created worlds, he knows neither their number nor their laws. They will perceive that he is like unto one of them; they will despise him, and, shaking off his tyranny, will fling him into the Gehenna where he has hurled those more worthy than himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so?\" murmured Zita, puffing out the smoke of her cigarette.... \"Nevertheless, this knowledge by virtue of which you reckon to enfranchise Heaven, has not destroyed religious sentiment on earth. In countries where they have set up and taught this science of physics, of chemistry, astronomy, and geology, which you think capable of delivering the world, Christianity has retained almost all its sway. If the positive sciences have had such a feeble influence on the beliefs of mankind, it is not likely they will exercise a greater one on the opinions of the angels, and nothing is of such dubious efficacy as scientific propaganda.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed Arcade, \"you deny that Science has given the Church its death-blow? Is it possible? The Church, at any rate, judges otherwise. Science, which you believe has no power over her, is redoubtable to her, since she proscribes it. From Galileo's dialogues to Monsieur Aulard's little manuals she has condemned all its discoveries. And not without reason.\r\n\r\n\"In former days, when she gathered within her fold all that was great in human thought, the Church held sway over the bodies as well as over the souls of men, and imposed unity of obedience by fire and sword. To-day her power is but a shadow and the elect among the great minds have withdrawn from her. That is the state to which Science has reduced her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly,\" replied the beautiful archangel, \"but how slowly, with what vicissitudes, at the price of what efforts, of what sacrifices!\"\r\n\r\nZita did not absolutely condemn scientific propaganda, but she anticipated no prompt or certain results from it. For her it was not so much a question of enlightening the angels; the important thing was to enfranchise them. In her opinion one only exerted a strong influence on individuals, whoever they might be, by rousing their passions, and appealing to their interests.\r\n\r\n\"Persuade the angels that they will cover themselves with glory by overthrowing the tyrant, and that they will be happier once they are free; that is the most practical policy to attempt, and, for my own part, I am devoting all my energies to its fulfilment. It is certainly no light task, because the Kingdom of Heaven is a military autocracy and there is no public opinion in it. Nevertheless, I do not despair of starting an intellectual movement. I do not wish to boast, but no one is more closely acquainted than I with the different classes of angelic society.\"\r\n\r\nThrowing away her cigarette, Zita pondered for a moment, then, amid the click of ivory balls on the billiard table, the clinking of glasses, the curt voices of the players announcing their points, the monotonous answers of the waiters to their customers, the Archangel enumerated the entire population of the spirits of light.\r\n\r\n\"We must not count on the Dominations, the Virtues, nor the Powers, which compose the celestial lower middle class. I have no need to tell you, for you know it as well as I, how selfish, base, and cowardly the middle classes are. As to the great dignitaries, the Ministers, the Generals, Thrones, Cherubim, and Seraphim, you know what they are; they will take no action. Let us, however, once prove ourselves the stronger, and we shall have them with us. For if autocrats do not readily acquiesce in their own downfall, once overthrown, all their forces recoil upon themselves. It will be well to work the Army. Entirely loyal as the Army is, it will allow itself to be influenced by a clever anarchist propaganda. But our greatest and most constant efforts ought to be brought to bear upon the angels of your own category, Arcade; the guardian angels, who dwell upon earth in such great numbers. They fill the lowest ranks of the hierarchy, are for the most part discontented with their lot, and more or less imbued with the ideas of the present century.\"\r\n\r\nShe had already conferred with the guardian angels of Montmartre, Clignancourt, and Filles-du-Calvaire. She had devised the plan of a vast association of Spirits on Earth with the view of conquering Heaven.\r\n\r\n\"To accomplish this task,\" she said, \"I have established myself in France. But not because I had the folly to believe myself freer in a republic than in a monarchy. Quite the contrary, for there is no country where the liberty of the individual is less respected than in France. But the people are indifferent to everything connected with religion; nowhere else, therefore, should I enjoy such tranquillity.\"\r\n\r\nShe invited Arcade to unite his efforts to hers, and when they separated at the door of the _brasserie_ the steel shutter was already making its groaning descent.\r\n\r\n\"Above all,\" said Zita, \"you must meet the gardener. I will take you to his rustic home one day.\"\r\n\r\nTh\\xc3\\xa9ophile, who had slumbered during all this talk, begged his friend to come home with him and smoke a cigarette. He lived quite near in the small street opposite, leading off the Boulevard. Arcade would see Bouchotte, she would please him.\r\n\r\nThey climbed up five flights of stairs. Bouchotte had not yet returned. A tin of sardines lay open on the piano. Red stockings coiled about the arm-chairs.\r\n\r\n\"It's a little place, but it's comfortable,\" said Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile.\r\n\r\nAnd gazing out of the window which looked out on the russet-coloured night, with its myriad lights, he added, \"One can see the _Sacr\\xc3\\xa9 Coeur_.\" His hand on Arcade's shoulder, he repeated several times, \"I am glad to see you.\"\r\n\r\nThen, dragging his former companion in glory into the kitchen passage, he put down his candlestick, drew a key from his pocket, opened a cupboard, and, raising a linen covering, disclosed two large white wings.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" he said, \"I have preserved them. From time to time, when I am alone, I go and look at them; it does me good.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he dabbed his reddened eyes. He stood awhile, overcome by silent emotion. Then, holding the candle near the long pinions which were moulting their down in places, he murmured, \"They are eaten away.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must put some pepper on them,\" said Arcade.\r\n\r\n\"I have done so,\" replied the angelic musician, sighing. \"I have put pepper, camphor, and powder on them. But nothing does any good.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n     WHICH REVEALS THE CHERUB TOILING FOR THE WELFARE OF HUMANITY      AND CONCLUDES IN AN ENTIRELY NOVEL MANNER WITH THE MIRACLE      OF THE FLUTE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first night of his incarnation Arcade slept at the angel Istar's, in a garret in that narrow, gloomy Rue Mazarine which wallows along beneath the shadow of the old Institute of France. Istar, who had been expecting him, had pushed against the wall the shattered retorts, cracked pots, broken bottles, and odds and ends of iron stoves, which made up the furniture of his room, and spread his clothes on the floor to lie on, leaving his guest his folding-bed with its straw mattress.\r\n\r\nThe celestial spirits differ from one another in appearance according to the hierarchy and the choir to which they belong, and according to their own particular nature. They are all beautiful; but in different fashion, and they do not all offer to the eye the soft contours and dimpling smiles of childhood with its rosy lights and pearly tints. Nor do they all adorn themselves with eternal youth, that indefinable beauty that Greek art in its decline has imparted to its most lovingly handled marbles, and whereof Christian painters have so often timidly essayed to give us veiled and softened imitations. In some of them the chin glows with tufts of hair, and the limbs are furnished with such vigorous muscles that it seems as if serpents were writhing beneath the skin. Some have no wings, others possess two, four, or six; others again are formed entirely of conjoined pinions. Many, and these not the least illustrious, take the form of superb monsters, such as the Centaurs of fable; nay, one may even see some who are living chariots, and wheels of fire. A member of the highest celestial hierarchy, Istar belonged to the choir of Cherubim or Ker\\xc3\\xbbbs who see above them the Seraphim alone. In common with all the angelic spirits of his rank he had formerly borne in Heaven the bodily shape of a winged bull surmounted by the head of a horned and bearded man, and carrying between his loins the attributes of generous fecundity. He was vaster and more vigorous than any animal on earth, and when he stood erect with outspread wings he covered with his shadow sixty archangels.\r\n\r\nSuch was Istar in his native home. There he radiated strength and sweetness. His heart was full of courage and his soul benevolent. Moreover, in those days he loved his lord. He believed him to be good and yielded him faithful service. But even while guarding the portals of his Master, he used to ponder unceasingly on the punishment of the rebellious angels and the curse of Eve. His mind worked slowly but profoundly. When, after a long course of centuries, he persuaded himself that Ialdabaoth in creating the world had created evil and death, he ceased to adore and to serve him. His love changed to hatred, his veneration to contempt. He shouted his execrations in his face, and fled to earth.\r\n\r\nEmbodied in human form and reduced to the stature of the sons of Adam, he still retained some characteristics of his former nature. His big protruding eyes, his beaked nose, his thick lips framed in a black beard which descended in curls on to his chest recalled those Cherubs of the tabernacle of Iahveh, of which the bulls of Nineveh afford us a pretty accurate representation. He bore the name of Istar on earth as well as in Heaven, and although exempt from vanity and free from all social prejudice, he was immensely desirous of showing himself sincere and truthful in all things. He therefore proclaimed the illustrious rank in which his birth had placed him in the celestial hierarchy and translated into French his title of Cherub by the equivalent one of Prince, calling himself Prince Istar. Seeking shelter among mankind he had developed an ardent love for them. While awaiting the coming of the hour when he should deliver Heaven from bondage, he dreamed of the salvation of regenerate humanity and was eager to consummate the destruction of this wicked world, in order to raise upon its ashes, to the sound of the lyre, a city radiant with happiness and love. A chemist in the pay of a dealer in nitrates, he lived very frugally. He wrote for newspapers with advanced views on liberty, spoke at public meetings, and had got himself sentenced several times to several months' imprisonment for anti-militarism.\r\n\r\nIstar greeted his brother Arcade cordially, approved of his rupture with the party of crime, and informed him of the descent of fifty of the children of light who, at the present moment, formed a colony near Val de Grace, imbued with a really excellent spirit.\r\n\r\n\"It is simply raining angels in Paris,\" he said, laughing. \"Every day some dignitary of the sacred palace falls on one's head, and soon the Sultan of the Cherubs will have no one to make into Vizirs or guards but the little unbreeched vagabonds of his pigeon coops.\"\r\n\r\nSoothed by the good news, Arcade fell asleep, full of happiness and hope.\r\n\r\nHe awoke in the early dawn and saw Prince Istar bending over his furnaces, his retorts, and his test tubes. Prince Istar was working for the good of humanity.\r\n\r\nEvery morning when Arcade woke he saw Prince Istar fulfilling his work of tenderness and love. Sometimes the Ker\\xc3\\xbbb, huddled up with his head in his hands, would softly murmur a few chemical formul\\xc3\\xa6; at others, drawing himself up to his full height, like a dark naked column, with his head, his arms, nay, his entire bust clean out of the sky-light window, he would deposit his melting-pot on the roof, fearing the perquisition with which he was constantly menaced. Moved by an immense pity for the miseries of the world wherein he dwelt in exile, conscious perhaps of the rumours to which his name gave rise, inebriated with his own virtue, he played the part of apostle to the Human Race, and neglecting the task he had undertaken in coming to earth, he forgot all about the emancipation of the angels. Arcade, who, on the contrary, dreamed of nothing else but of conquering Heaven and returning thither in triumph, reproached the Cherub with forgetting his native land.\r\n\r\nPrince Istar, with a great frank, uncouth laugh, acknowledged that he had no preference for angels over men.\r\n\r\n\"If I am doing my best,\" he replied to his celestial brother, \"if I am doing my best to stir up France and Europe, it is because the day is dawning which will behold the triumph of the social revolution. It is a pleasure to cast one's seed on ground so well prepared. The French having passed from feudalism to monarchy, and from monarchy to a financial oligarchy, will easily pass from a financial oligarchy to anarchy.\"\r\n\r\n\"How erroneous it is,\" retorted Arcade, \"to believe in great and sudden changes in the social order in Europe! The old order is still young in strength and power. The means of defence at her disposal are formidable. On the other hand, the proletariat's plan of defensive organisation is of the vaguest description and brings merely weakness and confusion to the struggle. In our celestial country all goes quite otherwise. Beneath an apparently unchangeable exterior all is rotten within. A mere push would suffice to overturn an edifice which has not been touched for millions of centuries. Out-worn administration, out-worn army, out-worn finance, the whole thing is more worm-eaten than either the Russian or Persian autocracy.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the kindly Arcade adjured the Cherub to fly first to the aid of his brethren who, though dwelling amid the soft clouds with the sound of citterns and their cups of paradisal wine around them, were in more wretched plight than mankind bowed over the grudging earth. For the latter have a conception of justice, while the angels rejoice in iniquity. He exhorted him to deliver the Prince of Light and his stricken companions and to re-establish them in their ancient honours.\r\n\r\nPrince Istar allowed himself to be convinced.\r\n\r\nHe promised to put the sweet persuasiveness of his words and the excellent formul\\xc3\\xa6 of his explosives at the service of the celestial revolution. He gave his promise.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow,\" he said.\r\n\r\nAnd when the morrow came he continued his anti-militarist propaganda at Issy-les-Moulineaux. Like the Titan Prometheus, Istar loved mankind.\r\n\r\nArcade, suffering from all the desires to which the sons of Adam are subjected, found himself lacking in resources to satisfy them. Istar gave him a start in a printing house in the Rue de Vaugirard where he knew the foreman. Arcade, thanks to his celestial intelligence, soon knew how to set up type and became, in a short time, a good compositor.\r\n\r\nAfter standing all day in the whirring workroom, holding the composing-stick in his left hand, and swiftly drawing the little leaden signs from the case in the order required by the copy fixed in the _visorium_, he would go and wash his hands at the pump and dine at the corner bar, a newspaper propped up before him on the marble table. Being now no longer invisible, he could not make his way into the d'Esparvieu library, and was thus debarred from allaying his ardent thirst for knowledge at that inexhaustible source. He went, of an evening, to read at the library of Ste. Genevi\\xc3\\xa8ve on the famous hill of learning, but there were only ordinary books to be had there; greasy things, covered with ridiculous annotations, and lacking many pages.\r\n\r\nThe sight of women troubled and unsettled him. He would remember Madame des Aubels and her charm, and, although he was handsome, he was not loved, because of his poverty and his workaday clothes. He saw much of Zita, and took a certain pleasure in going for walks with her on Sundays along the dusty roads which edge the grass-grown trenches of the fortifications. They wandered, the pair of them, by wayside inns, market-gardens, and green retreats, propounding and discussing the vastest plans that ever stirred the world, and, occasionally, as they passed along by some travelling circus, the steam organ of the merry-go-round would furnish an accompaniment to their words as they breathed fire and fury against Heaven.\r\n\r\nZita used often to say:\r\n\r\n\"Istar means well, but he's a simple fellow. He believes in the goodness of men and things. He undertakes the destruction of the old world and imagines that anarchy of itself will create order and harmony. You, Arcade, you believe in Science; you deem that men and angels are capable of understanding, whereas, in point of fact, they are only creatures of sentiment. You may be quite sure that nothing is to be obtained from them by appealing to their intelligence; one must rouse their interests and their passions.\"\r\n\r\nArcade, Istar, Zita, and three or four other angelic conspirators occasionally foregathered in Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile Belais' little flat, where Bouchotte gave them tea. Though she did not know that they were rebellious angels, she hated them instinctively, and feared them, for she had had a Christian education, albeit she had sadly failed to keep it up.\r\n\r\nPrince Istar alone pleased her; she thought there was something kind-hearted and an air of natural distinction about him. He stove in the sofa, broke down the arm-chairs, and tore corners off sheets of music to make notes, which he thrust into pockets invariably crammed with pamphlets and bottles. The musician used to gaze sorrowfully at the manuscript of his operetta, _Aline, Queen of Golconda_, with its corners all torn off. The prince also had a habit of giving Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile Belais all sorts of things to take care of--mechanical contrivances, chemicals, bits of old iron, powders, and liquids which gave off noisome smells. Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile Belais put them cautiously away in the cupboard where he kept his wings, and the responsibility weighed heavily upon him.\r\n\r\nArcade was much pained at the disdain of those of his fellows who had remained faithful. When they met him as they went on their sacred errands they regarded him as they passed by with looks of cruel hatred or of pity that was crueller still.\r\n\r\nHe used to visit the rebel angels whom Prince Istar pointed out to him, and usually met with a good reception, but as soon as he began to speak of conquering Heaven, they did not conceal the embarrassment and displeasure he caused them. Arcade perceived that they had no desire to be disturbed in their tastes, their affairs, and their habits. The falsity of their judgment, the narrowness of their minds, shocked him; and the rivalry, the jealousy they displayed towards one another deprived him of all hope of uniting them in a common cause. Perceiving how exile debases the character and warps the intellect, he felt his courage fail him.\r\n\r\nOne evening, when he had confessed his weariness of spirit to Zita, the beautiful archangel said:\r\n\r\n\"Let us go and see Nectaire; Nectaire has remedies of his own for sadness and fatigue.\"\r\n\r\nShe led him into the woods of Montmorency and stopped at the threshold of a small white house, adjoining a kitchen garden, laid waste by winter, where far back in the shadows the light shone on forcing-frames and cracked glass melon shades.\r\n\r\nNectaire opened the door to his visitors, and, after quieting the growls of a big mastiff which protected the garden, led them into a low room warmed by an earthenware stove.\r\n\r\nAgainst the whitewashed wall, on a deal board, among the onions and seeds, lay a flute ready to be put to the lips. A round walnut table bore a stone tobacco-jar, a pipe, a bottle of wine and some glasses. The gardener offered each of his guests a cane-seated chair, and himself sat down on a stool by the table.\r\n\r\nHe was a sturdy old man; thick grey hair stood up on his head, he had a furrowed brow, a snub-nose, a red face, and a forked beard.\r\n\r\nThe big mastiff stretched himself at his master's feet, rested his short black muzzle on his paws, and closed his eyes. The gardener poured out some wine for his guests, and when they had drunk and talked a little, Zita said to Nectaire:\r\n\r\n\"Please play your flute to us, you will give pleasure to my friend whom I have brought to see you.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man immediately consented. He put the boxwood pipe to his lips,--so clumsy was it that it looked as if the gardener had fashioned it himself,--and preluded with a few strange runs. Then he developed rich melodies in which the thrills sparkled like diamonds and pearls on a velvet ground. Touched by cunning fingers, animated with creative breath, the rustic pipe sang like a silver flute. There were no over-shrill notes and the tone was always even and pure. One seemed to be listening to the nightingale and the Muses singing together, the soul of Nature and the soul of Man. And the old man ordered and developed his thoughts in a musical language full of grace and daring. He told of love, of fear, of vain quarrels, of all-conquering laughter, of the calm light of the intellect, of the arrows of the mind piercing with their golden shafts the monsters of Ignorance and Hate. He told also of Joy and Sorrow bending their twin heads over the earth and of Desire which brings worlds into being.\r\n\r\nThe whole night listened to the flute of Nectaire. Already the evening star was rising above the paling horizon.\r\n\r\nThere they sat; Zita with hands clasped about her knees, Arcade, his head leaning on his hand, his lips apart. Motionless they listened. A lark, which had awakened hard by in a sandy field, lured by these novel sounds, rose swiftly in the air, hovered a few seconds, then dropped at one swoop into the musician's orchard. The neighbouring sparrows, forsaking the crannies of the mouldering walls, came and sat in a row on the window-ledge whence notes came welling forth that gave them more delight than oats or grains of barley. A jay, coming for the first time out of his wood, folded his sapphire wings on a leafless cherry tree. Beside the drain-head, a large black rat, glistening with the greasy water of the sewers, sitting on his hind legs, raised his short arms and slender fingers in amazement. A field-mouse, that dwelt in the orchard, was seated near him. Down from the tiles came the old tom-cat, who retained the grey fur, the ringed tail, the powerful loins, the courage, and the pride of his ancestors. He pushed against the half-open door with his nose and approaching the flute-player with silent tread, sat gravely down, pricking his ears that had been torn in many a nocturnal combat; the grocer's white cat followed him, sniffing the vibrant air and then, arching her back and closing her blue eyes, listened in ravishment. Mice, swarming in crowds from under the boards, surrounded them, and fearing neither tooth nor claw, sat motionless, their pink hands folded voluptuously on their bosoms. Spiders that had strayed far from their webs, with waving legs, gathered in a charmed circle on the ceiling. A small grey lizard, that had glided on to the doorstep, stayed there, fascinated, and, in the loft, the bat might have been seen hanging by her nails, head down, now half-awakened from her winter sleep, swaying to the rhythm of the marvellous flute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n     WHEREIN WE SEE YOUNG MAURICE BEWAILING THE LOSS OF HIS      GUARDIAN ANGEL, EVEN IN HIS MISTRESS'S ARMS, AND WHEREIN WE      HEAR THE ABB\\xc3\\x89 PATOUILLE REJECT AS VAIN AND ILLUSORY ALL      NOTIONS OF A NEW REBELLION OF THE ANGELS\r\n\r\n\r\nA fortnight had elapsed since the angel's apparition in the flat. For the first time Gilberte arrived before Maurice at the rendezvous. Maurice was gloomy, Gilberte sulky. So far as they were concerned Nature had resumed her drab monotony. They eyed each other languidly, and kept glancing towards the angle between the wardrobe with the mirror and the window, where recently the pale shade of Arcade had taken shape, and where now the blue cretonne of the hangings was the only thing visible. Without giving him a name (it was unnecessary) Madame des Aubels asked:\r\n\r\n\"You have not seen him since?\"\r\n\r\nSlowly, sadly, Maurice turned his head from right to left, and from left to right.\r\n\r\n\"You look as if you missed him,\" continued Madame des Aubels. \"But come, confess that he gave you a terrible fright, and that you were shocked at his unconventionally.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly he was unconventional,\" said Maurice without any resentment.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, Maurice, is it nothing to you now to be with me alone?... You need an angel to inspire you. That is sad, for a young man like you!\"\r\n\r\nMaurice appeared not to hear, and asked gravely:\r\n\r\n\"Gilberte, do you feel that your guardian angel is watching over you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I, not at all. I have never thought of him, and yet I am not without religion. In the first place, people who have none are like animals. And then one cannot go straight without religion. It is impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly, that's just it,\" said Maurice, his eyes on the violet stripes of his flowerless pyjamas; \"when one has one's guardian angel one does not even think about him, and when one has lost him one feels very lonely.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you miss this....\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the fact is....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, yes, you miss him. Well, my dear, the loss of such a guardian angel as that is no great matter. No, no! he is not worth much, that Arcade of yours. On that famous day, while you were out getting him some clothes, he was ever so long fastening my dress, and I certainly felt his hand.... Well, at any rate, don't trust him.\"\r\n\r\nMaurice dreamily lit a cigarette. They spoke of the six days' bicycle race at the winter velodrome, and of the aviation show at the motor exhibition at Brussels, without experiencing the slightest amusement. Then they tried love-making as a sort of convenient pastime, and succeeded in becoming moderately absorbed in it; but at the very moment when she might have been expected to play a part more in accordance with a mutual sentiment, she exclaimed with a sudden start:\r\n\r\n\"Good Heavens! Maurice, how stupid of you to tell me that my guardian angel can see me. You cannot imagine how uncomfortable the idea makes me.\"\r\n\r\nMaurice, somewhat taken aback, recalled, a little roughly, his mistress's wandering thoughts.\r\n\r\nShe declared that her principles forbade her to think of playing a round game with angels.\r\n\r\nMaurice was longing to see Arcade again and had no other thought. He reproached himself for suffering him to depart without discovering where he was going, and he cudgelled his brains night and day thinking how to find him again.\r\n\r\nOn the bare chance, he put a notice in the personal column of one of the big papers, running thus:\r\n\r\n\"Arcade. Come back to your Maurice.\"\r\n\r\nDay after day went by, and Arcade did not return.\r\n\r\nOne morning, at seven o'clock, Maurice went to St. Sulpice to hear Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Patouille say Mass, then, as the priest was leaving the sacristy, he went up to him and asked to be heard for a moment.\r\n\r\nThey descended the steps of the church together and in the bright morning light walked round the fountain of the _Quatre \\xc3\\x89v\\xc3\\xaaques_. In spite of his troubled conscience and the difficulty of presenting so extraordinary a case with any degree of credibility, Maurice related how the angel Arcade had appeared to him and had announced his unhappy resolve to separate from him and to stir up a new revolt of the spirits of glory. And young d'Esparvieu asked the worthy ecclesiastic how to find his celestial guardian again, since he could not bear his absence, and how to lead his angel back to the Christian faith. Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Patouille replied in a tone of affectionate sorrow that his dear child had been dreaming, that he took a morbid hallucination for reality, and that it was not permissible to believe that good angels may revolt.\r\n\r\n\"People have a notion,\" he added, \"that they can lead a life of dissipation and disorder with impunity. They are wrong. The abuse of pleasure corrupts the intelligence and impairs the understanding. The devil takes possession of the sinner's senses, penetrating even to his soul. He has deceived you, Maurice, by a clumsy artifice.\"\r\n\r\nMaurice objected that he was not in any way a victim of hallucinations, that he had not been dreaming, that he had seen his guardian angel with his eyes and heard him with his ears.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur l'Abb\\xc3\\xa9,\" he insisted, \"a lady who happened to be with me at the time,--I need not mention her name,--also saw and heard him. And, moreover, she felt the angel's fingers straying ... well, anyhow, she felt them.... Believe me, Monsieur l'Abb\\xc3\\xa9, nothing could be more real, more positively certain than this apparition. The angel was fair, young, very handsome. His clear skin seemed, in the shadow, as if bathed in milky light. He spoke in a pure, sweet voice.\"\r\n\r\n\"That, alone, my child,\" the Abb\\xc3\\xa9 interrupted quickly, \"proves you were dreaming. According to all the demonologies, bad angels have a hoarse voice, which grates like a rusty lock, and even if they did contrive to give a certain look of beauty to their faces, they cannot succeed in imitating the pure voice of the good spirits. This fact, attested by numerous witnesses, is established beyond all doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Monsieur l'Abb\\xc3\\xa9, I saw him. I saw him sit down, stark naked, in an arm-chair on a pair of black stockings. What else do you want me to tell you?\"\r\n\r\nThe Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Patouille appeared in no way disturbed by this announcement.\r\n\r\n\"I say once more, my son,\" he replied, \"that these unhappy illusions, these dreams of a deeply troubled soul, are to be ascribed to the deplorable state of your conscience. I believe, moreover, that I can detect the particular circumstance that has caused your unstable mind thus to come to grief. During the winter in company with Monsieur Sariette and your Uncle Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan, you came, in an evil frame of mind, to see the Chapel of the Holy Angels in this church, then undergoing repair. As I observed on that occasion, it is impossible to keep artists too closely to the rules of Christian art; they cannot be too strongly enjoined to respect Holy Writ and its authorized interpreters. Monsieur Eug\\xc3\\xa8ne Delacroix did not suffer his fiery genius to be controlled by tradition. He brooked no guidance and, here, in this chapel he has painted pictures which in common parlance we call lurid, compositions of a violent, terrible nature which, far from inspiring the soul with peace, quietude, and calm, plunge it into a state of agitation. In them the angels are depicted with wrathful countenances, their features are sombre and uncouth. One might take them to be Lucifer and his companions meditating their revolt. Well, my son, it was these pictures, acting upon a mind already weakened and undermined by every kind of dissipation, that have filled it with the trouble to which it is at present a prey.\"\r\n\r\nBut Maurice would have none of it.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no! Monsieur l'Abb\\xc3\\xa9,\" he cried, \"it is not Eug\\xc3\\xa8ne Delacroix's pictures that have been troubling me. I didn't so much as look at them. I am completely indifferent to that kind of art.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, my son, believe me: there is no truth, no reality, in any of the story you have just related to me. Your guardian angel has certainly not appeared to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Abb\\xc3\\xa9,\" replied Maurice, who had the most absolute confidence in the evidence of the senses, \"I saw him tying up a woman's shoe-laces and putting on the trousers of a suicide.\"\r\n\r\nAnd stamping his feet on the asphalt, Maurice called as witnesses to the truth of his words the sky, the earth, all nature, the towers of St. Sulpice, the walls of the great seminary, the Fountain of the _Quatre \\xc3\\x89v\\xc3\\xaaques_, the public lavatory, the cabmen's shelter, the taxis and motor 'buses' shelter, the trees, the passers-by, the dogs, the sparrows, the flower-seller and her flowers.\r\n\r\nThe Abb\\xc3\\xa9 made haste to end the interview.\r\n\r\n\"All this is error, falsehood, and illusion, my child,\" said he. \"You are a Christian: think as a Christian,--a Christian does not allow himself to be seduced by empty shadows. Faith protects him against the seduction of the marvellous, he leaves credulity to freethinkers. There are credulous people for you--freethinkers! There is no humbug they will not swallow. But the Christian carries a weapon which dissipates diabolical illusions,--the sign of the Cross. Reassure yourself, Maurice,--you have not lost your guardian angel. He still watches over you. It lies with you not to make this task too difficult nor too painful for him. Good-bye, Maurice. The weather is going to change, for I feel a burning in my big toe.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Patouille went off with his breviary under his arm, hobbling along with a dignity that seemed to foretell a mitre.\r\n\r\nThat very day, Arcade and Zita were leaning over the parapet of La Butte, gazing down on the mist and smoke that lay floating over the vast city.\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible,\" said Arcade, \"for the mind to conceive all the pain and suffering that lie pent within a great city? It is my belief that if a man succeeded in realising it, the weight of it would crush him to the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" answered Zita, \"every living being in that place of torment is enamoured of life. It is a great enigma!\r\n\r\n\"Unhappy, ill-fated, while they live, the idea of ceasing to be is, nevertheless, a horror to them. They look not for solace in annihilation, it does not even bring them the promise of rest. In their madness they even look upon nothingness with terror: they have peopled it with phantoms. Look you at these pediments, these towers and domes and spires that pierce the mist and rear on high their glittering crosses. Men bow in adoration before the demiurge who has given them a life that is worse than death, and a death that is worse than life.\"\r\n\r\nZita was for a long time lost in thought. At length she broke silence, saying:\r\n\r\n\"There is something, Arcade, that I must confess to you. It was no desire for a purer justice or wiser laws that hurried Ithuriel earthward. Ambition, a taste for intrigue, the love of wealth and honour, all these things made Heaven, with its calm, unbearable to me, and I longed to mingle with the restless race of men. I came, and by an art unknown to nearly all the angels, I learned how to fashion myself a body which, since I could change it as the fancy seized me, to whatsoever age and sex I would, has permitted me to experience the most diverse and amazing of human destinies. A hundred times I took a position of renown among the leaders of the day, the lords of wealth and princes of nations. I will not reveal to you, Arcade, the famous names I bore; know only that I was pre-eminent in learning, in the fine arts, in power, wealth, and beauty, among all the nations of the world. At last, it was but a few years since, as I was journeying in France, under the outward semblance of a distinguished foreigner, I chanced to be roaming at evening through the forest of Montmorency, when I heard a flute unfolding all the sorrows of Heaven. The purity and sadness of its notes rent my very soul. Never before had I hearkened to aught so lovely. My eyes were wet with tears, my bosom full of sobs, as I drew near and beheld, on the skirts of a glade, an old man like to a faun, blowing on a rustic pipe. It was Nectaire. I cast myself at his feet, imprinted kisses on his hands and on his lips divine, and fled away....\r\n\r\n\"From that day forth, conscious of the littleness of human achievements, weary of the tumult and the vanity of earthly things, ashamed of my vast and profitless endeavours, and deciding to seek out a loftier aim for my ambition, I looked upwards towards my skiey home and vowed I would return to it as a Deliverer. I rid myself of titles, name, wealth, friends, the horde of sycophants and flatterers and, as Zita the obscure, set to work in indigence and solitude, to bring freedom into Heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" said Arcade, \"I too have heard the flute of Nectaire. But who is this old gardener who can thus woo from a rude wooden pipe notes that are so moving and so beautiful?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will soon know,\" answered Zita.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n     WHEREIN MIRA THE SEERESS, Z\\xc3\\x89PHYRINE, AND THE FATAL AM\\xc3\\x89D\\xc3\\x89E      ARE SUCCESSIVELY BROUGHT UPON THE SCENE, AND WHEREIN THE      NOTION OF EURIPIDES THAT THOSE WHOM ZEUS WISHES TO CRUSH HE      FIRST MAKES MAD, IS ILLUSTRATED BY THE TERRIBLE EXAMPLE OF      MONSIEUR SARIETTE\r\n\r\n\r\nDisappointed at his failure to enlighten an ecclesiastic renowned for his clarity of mind, and frustrated in the hope of finding his angel again on the high road of orthodoxy, Maurice took it into his head to resort to occultism and resolved to go and consult a seer. He would have undoubtedly applied to Madame de Th\\xc3\\xa8bes, but he had already questioned her on the occasion of his early love troubles, and her replies showed such wisdom that he no longer believed her to be a soothsayer. He therefore had recourse to a fashionable medium, Madame Mira. He had heard many examples quoted of the extraordinary insight of this seeress, but it was necessary to present Madame Mira with some object which the absent one had either touched or worn and to which her translucent gaze had to be attracted. Maurice, trying to remember what the angel had touched since his ill-fated incarnation, recollected that in his celestial nudity he had sat down in an arm-chair on Madame des Aubels' black stockings and that he had afterwards helped that lady to dress.\r\n\r\nMaurice asked Gilberte for one of the talismans required by the clairvoyante. But Gilberte could not give him a single one, unless, as she said, she herself were to play the part of the talisman. For the angel had, in her case, displayed the greatest indiscretion, and such agility that it was impossible always to forestall his enterprise. On hearing this confession, which nevertheless told him nothing new, Maurice lost his temper with the angel, calling him by the names of the lowest animals and swearing he would give him a good kick when he got him within reach of his foot. But his fury soon turned against Madame des Aubels; he accused her of having provoked the insolence she now denounced, and in his wrath he referred to her by all the zoological symbols of immodesty and perversity. His love for Arcade was rekindled in his heart, and burned with a more ardent flame than ever, and the deserted youth, with outstretched arms and bended knees, invoked his angel with sobs and lamentations.\r\n\r\nDuring his sleepless nights it occurred to him that perhaps the books the angel had turned over before his incarnation might serve as a talisman. One morning, therefore, Maurice went up to the library and greeted Monsieur Sariette, who was cataloguing under the romantic gaze of Alexandre d'Esparvieu. Monsieur Sariette smiled, but his face was deathly pale. Now that an invisible hand no longer upset the books placed under his charge, now that tranquillity and order once more reigned in the library, Monsieur Sariette was happy, but his strength diminished day by day. There was little left of him but a frail and contented shadow.\r\n\r\n      \"One dies, in full content, of sorrow past.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Sariette,\" said Maurice, \"you remember that time when your books were disarranged every night, how armfuls disappeared, how they were dragged about, turned over, ruined, and sent rolling helter-skelter as far as the gutter in the Rue Palatine. Those were great days! Point out to me, Monsieur Sariette, the books which suffered most.\"\r\n\r\nThis proposition threw Monsieur Sariette into a melancholy stupor, and Maurice had to repeat his request three times before he could make the aged librarian understand. At length he pointed to a very ancient Talmud from Jerusalem as having been frequently touched by those unseen hands. An apocryphal Gospel of the third century, consisting of twenty papyrus sheets, had also quitted its place time after time. Gassendi's Correspondence too seemed to have been well thumbed.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" added Monsieur Sariette, \"the book to which the mysterious visitant devoted the most particular attention was undoubtedly a little copy of _Lucretius_ adorned with the arms of Philippe de Vend\\xc3\\xb4me, Grand Prieur de France, with autograph annotations by Voltaire, who, as is well known, frequently visited the Temple in his younger days. The fearsome reader who caused me such terrible anxiety never grew weary of this _Lucretius_ and made it his bedside book, as it were. His taste was sound, for it's a gem of a thing. Alas! the monster made a blot of ink on page 137 which perhaps the chemists with all the science at their disposal will be powerless to erase.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Monsieur Sariette heaved a profound sigh. He repented having said all this when young d'Esparvieu asked him for the loan of the precious _Lucretius_. Vainly did the jealous custodian affirm that the book was being repaired at the binder's and was not available. Maurice made it clear that he wasn't to be taken in like that. He strode resolutely into the abode of the philosophers and the globes and seating himself in an arm-chair said:\r\n\r\n\"I am waiting.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur Sariette suggested his having another edition. There were some that, textually, were more correct, and were, therefore, preferable from the student's point of view. He offered him Barbou's edition, or Coustelier's, or, better still, a French translation. He could have the Baron des Coutures' version--which was perhaps a little old-fashioned--or La Grange's, or those in the Nisard and Panckouke series; or, again, there were two versions of striking elegance, one in verse and the other in prose, both from the pen of Monsieur de Pongerville of the French Academy.\r\n\r\n\"I don't need a translation,\" said Maurice proudly. \"Give me the Prior de Vend\\xc3\\xb4me's copy.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur Sariette went slowly up to the cupboard in which the jewel in question was contained. The keys were rattling in his trembling hand. He raised them to the lock and withdrew them again immediately and suggested that Maurice should have the common _Lucretius_ published by Garnier.\r\n\r\n\"It's very handy,\" said he with an engaging smile.\r\n\r\nBut the silence with which this proposal was received made it clear that resistance was useless. He slowly drew forth the volume from its place, and having taken the precaution to see that there wasn't a speck of dust on the table-cloth, he laid it tremblingly thereon before the great-grandson of Alexandre d'Esparvieu.\r\n\r\nMaurice began to turn the leaves, and when he got to page 137 he saw the stain which had been made with violet ink. It was about the size of a pea.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, that's it,\" said old Sariette, who had his eye on the _Lucretius_ the whole time; \"that's the trace those invisible monsters left behind them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, there were several of them, Monsieur Sariette?\" exclaimed Maurice.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell. But I don't know whether I have a right to have this blot removed since, like the blot Paul Louis Courier made on the Florentine manuscript, it constitutes a literary document, so to speak.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely were the words out of the old fellow's mouth when the front door bell rang and there was a confused noise of voices and footsteps in the next room. Sariette ran forward at the sound and collided with P\\xc3\\xa8re Guinardon's mistress, old Z\\xc3\\xa9phyrine, who, with her tousled hair sticking up like a nest of vipers, her face aflame, her bosom heaving, her abdominal part like an eiderdown quilt puffed out by a terrific gale, was choking with grief and rage. And amid sobs and sighs and groans and all the innumerable sounds which, on earth, make up the mighty uproar to which the emotions of living beings and the tumult of nature give rise, she cried:\r\n\r\n\"He's gone, the monster! He's gone off with her. He's cleared out the whole shanty and left me to shift for myself with eighteenpence in my purse.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she proceeded to give a long and incoherent account of how Michel Guinardon had abandoned her and gone to live with Octavie, the bread-woman's daughter, and she let loose a torrent of abuse against the traitor.\r\n\r\n\"A man whom I've kept going with my own money for fifty years and more. For I've had plenty of the needful and known plenty of the upper ten and all. I dragged him out of the gutter and now this is what I get for it. He's a bright beauty, that friend of yours. The lazy scoundrel. Why, he had to be dressed like a child, the drunken contemptible brute. You don't know him yet, Monsieur Sariette. He's a forger. He turns out Giottos, Giottos, I tell you, and Fra Angelicos and Grecos, as hard as he can and sells them to art-dealers--yes, and Fragonards too, and Baudouins. He's a debauchee, and doesn't believe in God! That's the worst of the lot, Monsieur Sariette, for without the fear of God....\"\r\n\r\nLong did Z\\xc3\\xa9phyrine continue to pour forth vituperations. When at last her breath failed her, Monsieur Sariette availed himself of the opportunity to exhort her to be calm and bring herself to look on the bright side of things. Guinardon would come back. A man doesn't forget anyone he's lived and got on well with for fifty years----\r\n\r\nThese two observations only goaded her to a fresh outburst, and Z\\xc3\\xa9phyrine swore she would never forget the slight that had been put on her; she swore she would never have the monster back with her any more. And if he came to ask her to forgive him on his knees, she would let him grovel at her feet.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you understand, Monsieur Sariette, that I despise and hate him, that he makes me sick?\"\r\n\r\nSixty times she voiced these lofty sentiments; sixty times she vowed she would never have Guinardon back with her again, that she couldn't bear the sight of him, even in a picture.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Sariette made no attempt to oppose a resolve which, after protestations such as these, he regarded as unshakable. He did not blame Z\\xc3\\xa9phyrine in the least. He even supported her. Unfolding to the deserted one a purer future, he told her of the frailty of human sentiment, exhorted her to display a spirit of renunciation and enjoined her to show a pious resignation to the will of God.\r\n\r\n\"Seeing, in truth, that your friend is so little worthy of affection ...\"\r\n\r\nHe was not suffered to continue. Z\\xc3\\xa9phyrine flew at him, and shaking him furiously by the collar of his frock-coat, she yelled, half choking with rage: \"So little worthy of affection! Michel! Ah! my boy, you find another more kind, more gay, more witty, you find another like him, always young, yes, always. Not worthy of affection! Anyone can see you don't know anything about love, you old duffer.\"\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of the fact that P\\xc3\\xa8re Sariette was thus deeply engaged, young d'Esparvieu slipped the little _Lucretius_ into his pocket, and strolled deliberately past the crouching librarian, bidding him adieu with a little wave of the hand.\r\n\r\nArmed with his talisman, he hastened to the Place des Ternes, to interview Madame Mira. She received him in a red drawing-room where neither owl nor frog nor any of the paraphernalia of ancient magic were to be found. Madame Mira, in a prune-coloured dress, her hair powdered, though already past her prime, was of very good appearance. She spoke with a certain elegance and prided herself on discovering hidden things by the help alone of Science, Philosophy, and Religion. She felt the morocco binding, feigning to close her eyes, and looking meanwhile through the narrow slit between her lids at the Latin title and the coat of arms which conveyed nothing to her.\r\n\r\nAccustomed to receive as tokens such things as rings, handkerchiefs, letters, and locks of hair, she could not conceive to what sort of individual this singular book could belong. By habitual and mechanical cunning she disguised her real surprise under a feigned surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Strange!\" she murmured, \"strange! I do not see quite clearly ... I perceive a woman....\"\r\n\r\nAs she let fall this magic word, she glanced furtively to see what sort of an effect it had and beheld on her questioner's face an unexpected look of disappointment. Perceiving that she was off the track, she immediately changed her oracle:\r\n\r\n\"But she fades away immediately. It is strange, strange! I have a confused impression of some vague form, a being that I cannot define,\" and having assured herself by a hurried glance that, this time, her words were going down, she expatiated on the vagueness of the person and on the mist that enveloped him.\r\n\r\nHowever, the vision grew clearer to Madame Mira, who was following a clue step by step.\r\n\r\n\"A wide street ... a square with a statue ... a deserted street,--stairs. He is there in a bluish room--he is a young man, with pale and careworn face. There are things he seems to regret, and which he would not do again did they still remain undone.\"\r\n\r\nBut the effort at divination had been too great. Fatigue prevented the clairvoyante from continuing her transcendental researches. She spent her remaining strength in impressively recommending him who consulted her to remain in intimate union with God if he wished to regain what he had lost and succeed in his attempts.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Maurice placed a louis on the mantelpiece and went away moved and troubled, persuaded that Madame Mira possessed supernatural faculties, but unfortunately insufficient ones.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the stairs he remembered he had left the little _Lucretius_ on the table of the pythoness, and, thinking that the old maniac Sariette would never get over its loss, went up to recover possession of it.\r\n\r\nOn re-entering the paternal abode his gaze lighted upon a shadowy and grief-stricken figure. It was old Sariette, who in tones as plaintive as the wail of the November wind began to beg for his _Lucretius_. Maurice pulled it carelessly out of his great-coat pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Don't flurry yourself, Monsieur Sariette,\" said he. \"There the thing is.\"\r\n\r\nClasping the jewel to his bosom the old librarian bore it away and laid it gently down on the blue table-cloth, thinking all the while where he might safely hide his precious treasure, and turning over all sorts of schemes in his mind as became a zealous curator. But who among us shall boast of his wisdom? The foresight of man is short, and his prudence is for ever being baffled. The blows of fate are ineluctable; no man shall evade his doom. There is no counsel, no caution that avails against destiny. Hapless as we are, the same blind force which regulates the courses of atom and of star fashions universal order from our vicissitudes. Our ill-fortune is necessary to the harmony of the Universe. It was the day for the binder, a day which the revolving seasons brought round twice a year, beneath the sign of the Ram and the sign of the Scales. That day, ever since morning, Monsieur Sariette had been making things ready for the binder. He had laid out on the table as many of the newly purchased paper-bound volumes as were deemed worthy of a permanent binding or of being put in boards, and also those books whose binding was in need of repair, and of all these he had drawn up a detailed and accurate list. Punctually at five o'clock, old Am\\xc3\\xa9d\\xc3\\xa9e, the man from L\\xc3\\xa9ger-Massieu's, the binder in the Rue de l'Abbaye, presented himself at the d'Esparvieu library and, after a double check had been carried out by Monsieur Sariette, thrust the books he was to take back to his master into a piece of cloth which he fastened into knots at the four corners and hoisted on to his shoulder. He then saluted the librarian with the following words, \"Good night, all!\" and went downstairs.\r\n\r\nEverything went off on this occasion as usual. But Am\\xc3\\xa9d\\xc3\\xa9e, seeing the _Lucretius_ on the table, innocently put it into the bag with the others, and took it away without Monsieur Sariette's perceiving it. The librarian quitted the home of the Philosophers and Globes in entire forgetfulness of the book whose absence had been causing him such horrible anxiety all day long. Some people may take a stern view of the matter and call this a lapse, a defection of his better nature. But would it not be more accurate to say that fate had decided that things should come to pass in this manner, and that what is called chance, and is in fact but the regular order of nature, had accomplished this imperceptible deed which was to have such awful consequences in the sight of man? Monsieur Sariette went off to his dinner at the _Quatre \\xc3\\x89v\\xc3\\xaaques_, and read his paper _La Croix_. He was tranquil and serene. It was only the next morning when he entered the abode of the Philosophers and Globes that he remembered the _Lucretius_. Failing to see it on the table he looked for it everywhere, but without success. It never entered his head that Am\\xc3\\xa9d\\xc3\\xa9e might have taken it away by mistake. What he did think was that the invisible visitant had returned, and he was mightily disturbed.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy curator, hearing a noise on the landing, opened the door and found it was little L\\xc3\\xa9on, who, with a gold-braided _k\\xc3\\xa9pi_ stuck on his head, was shouting \"Vive la France\" and hurling dusters and feather-brooms and Hippolyte's floor polish at imaginary foes. The child preferred this landing for playing soldiers to any other part of the house, and sometimes he would stray into the library. Monsieur Sariette was seized with the sudden suspicion that it was he who had taken the _Lucretius_ to use as a missile and he ordered him, in threatening tones, to give it back. The child denied that he had taken it, and Monsieur Sariette had recourse to cajolery.\r\n\r\n\"L\\xc3\\xa9on, if you bring me back the little red book, I will give you some chocolates.\"\r\n\r\nThe child grew thoughtful; and in the evening, as Monsieur Sariette was going downstairs, he met L\\xc3\\xa9on, who said:\r\n\r\n\"There's the book!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, holding out a much-torn picture-book called _The Story of Gribouille_, demanded his chocolates.\r\n\r\nA few days later the post brought Maurice the prospectus of an enquiry agency managed by an ex-employee at the Prefecture of Police; it promised celerity and discretion. He found at the address indicated a moustached gentleman morose and careworn, who demanded a deposit and promised to find the individual.\r\n\r\nThe ex-police official soon wrote to inform him that very onerous investigations had been commenced and asked for fresh funds. Maurice gave him no more and resolved to carry on the search himself. Imagining, not without some likelihood, that the angel would associate with the wretched, seeing that he had no money, and with the exiled of all nations--like himself, revolutionaries--he visited the lodging-houses at St. Ouen, at la Chapelle, Montmartre, and the Barri\\xc3\\xa8re d'Italie. He sought him in the doss-houses, public-houses where they give you plates of tripe, and others where you can get a sausage for three sous; he searched for him in the cellars at the Market and at P\\xc3\\xa8re Momie's.\r\n\r\nMaurice visited the restaurants where nihilists and anarchists take their meals. There he came across men dressed as women, gloomy and wild-looking youths, and blue-eyed octogenarians who laughed like little children. He observed, asked questions, was taken for a spy, had a knife thrust into him by a very beautiful woman, and the very next day continued his search in beer-houses, lodging-houses, houses of ill-fame, gambling-hells down by the fortifications, at the receivers of stolen goods, and among the \"apaches.\"\r\n\r\nSeeing him thus pale, harassed, and silent, his mother grew worried.\r\n\r\n\"We must find him a wife,\" she said. \"It is a pity that Mademoiselle de la Verdeli\\xc3\\xa8re has not a bigger fortune.\"\r\n\r\nAbb\\xc3\\xa9 Patouille did not hide his anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"This child,\" he said, \"is passing through a moral crisis.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am more inclined to think,\" replied Monsieur Ren\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu, \"that he is under the influence of some bad woman. We must find him an occupation which will absorb him and flatter his vanity. I might get him appointed Secretary to the Committee for the Preservation of Country Churches, or Consulting Counsel to the Syndicate of Catholic Plumbers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n     WHEREIN WE LEARN THAT SOPHAR, NO LESS EAGER FOR GOLD THAN      MAMMON, LOOKED UPON HIS HEAVENLY HOME LESS FAVOURABLY THAN      UPON FRANCE, A COUNTRY BLESSED WITH A SAVINGS BANK AND LOAN      DEPARTMENTS, AND WHEREIN WE SEE, YET ONCE AGAIN, THAT WHOSO      IS POSSESSED OF THIS WORLD'S GOODS FEARS THE EVIL EFFECTS OF      ANY CHANGE\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Arcade led a life of obscure toil. He worked at a printer's in the Rue St. Beno\\xc3\\xaet, and lived in an attic in the Rue Mouffetard. His comrades having gone on strike, he left the workroom and devoted his day to his propaganda. So successful was he that he won over to the side of revolt fifty thousand of those guardian angels who, as Zita had surmised, were discontented with their condition and imbued with the spirit of the times. But lacking money, he lacked liberty, and could not employ his time as he wished in instructing the sons of Heaven. So, too, Prince Istar, hampered by want of funds, manufactured fewer bombs than were needed, and these less fine. Of course he prepared a good many small pocket machines. He had filled Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile's rooms with them, and not a day passed but he forgot some and left them lying about on the seats in various caf\\xc3\\xa9s. But a nice bomb, easily handled and capable of destroying many big mansions, cost him from twenty to twenty-five thousand francs; and Prince Istar only possessed two of this kind. Equally bent on procuring funds, Arcade and Istar both went to make a request for money from a celebrated financier named Max Everdingen, who, as everyone knows, is the managing director of the biggest banking concern in France and indeed in the whole world. What is not so well known is that Max Everdingen was not born of woman, but is a fallen angel. Nevertheless, such is the truth. In Heaven he was named Sophar, and guarded the treasures of Ialdabaoth, a great collector of gold and precious stones. In the exercise of this function Sophar contracted a love of riches which could not be satisfied in a state of society in which banks and stock exchanges are alike unknown. His heart flamed with an ardent love for the god of the Hebrews to whom he remained faithful during a long course of centuries. But at the commencement of the twentieth century of the Christian era, casting his eyes down from the height of the firmament upon France, he saw that this country, under the name of a Republic, was constituted as a plutocracy and that, under the appearance of a democratic government, high finance exercised sovereign sway, untrammelled and unchecked.\r\n\r\nHenceforth life in the Empyrean became intolerable to him. He longed for France as for the promised land, and one day, bearing with him all the precious stones he could carry, he descended to earth and established himself in Paris. This angel of cupidity did good business there. Since his materialisation his face had lost its celestial aspect; it reproduced the Semitic type in all its purity, and one could admire the lines and the puckers which wrinkle the faces of bankers and which are to be seen in the money-changers of Quintin Matsys.\r\n\r\nHis beginnings were humble and his success amazing. He married an ugly woman and they saw themselves reflected in their children as in a mirror. Baron Max Everdingen's large mansion, which rears itself on the heights of the Trocad\\xc3\\xa9ro, is crammed with the spoils of Christian Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Baron received Arcade and Prince Istar in his study,--one of the most modest rooms in his mansion. The ceiling is decorated with a fresco of Tiepolo, taken from a Venetian palace. The bureau of the Regent, Philip of Orleans, is in this room, which is full of cabinets, show-cases, pictures, and statues.\r\n\r\nArcade allowed his gaze to wander over the walls.\r\n\r\n\"How comes it, my brother Sophar,\" said he, \"that you, in spite of your Jewish heart, obey so ill the commandment of the Lord your God who said: 'Thou shalt have no graven images'? for here I see an Apollo of Houdon's and a Hebe of Lemoine's, and several busts by Caffieri. And, like Solomon in his old age, O son of God, you set up in your dwelling-place the idols of strange nations: for such are this Venus of Boucher, this Jupiter of Rubens, and those nymphs that are indebted to Fragonard's brush for the gooseberry jam which smears their gleaming limbs. And here in this single show-case, Sophar, you keep the sceptre of St. Louis, six hundred pearls of Marie Antoinette's broken necklace, the imperial mantle of Charles V, the tiara wrought by Ghiberti for Pope Martin V, the Colonna, Bonaparte's sword--and I know not what besides.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mere trifles,\" said Max Everdingen.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Baron,\" said Prince Istar, \"you even possess the ring which Charlemagne placed on a fairy's finger and which was thought to be lost. But let us discuss the business on which we have come. My friend and I have come to ask you for money.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can well believe it,\" replied Max Everdingen. \"Everyone wants money, but for different reasons. What do you want money for?\"\r\n\r\nPrince Istar replied simply:\r\n\r\n\"To stir up a revolution in France.\"\r\n\r\n\"In France!\" repeated the Baron, \"in France? Well, I shall give you no money for that, you may be quite sure.\"\r\n\r\nArcade did not disguise the fact that he had expected greater liberality and more generous help from a celestial brother.\r\n\r\n\"Our project,\" he said, \"is a vast one. It embraces both Heaven and Earth. It is settled in every detail. We shall first bring about a social revolution in France, in Europe, on the whole planet; then we shall carry war into the heavens, where we shall establish a peaceful democracy. And to reduce the citadels of Heaven, to overturn the mountain of God, to storm celestial Jerusalem, a vast army is needful, enormous resources, formidable machines, and electrophores of a strength yet unknown. It is our intention to commence with France.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are madmen!\" exclaimed Baron Everdingen; \"madmen and fools! Listen to me. There is not one single reform to carry out in France. All is perfect, finally settled, unchangeable. You hear?--unchangeable.\" And to add force to his statement, Baron Everdingen banged his fist three times on the Regent's bureau.\r\n\r\n\"Our points of view differ,\" said Arcade sweetly. \"_I_ think, as does Prince Istar, that everything should be changed in this country. But what boots it to dispute the matter? Moreover, it is too late. We have come to speak to you, O my brother Sophar, in the name of five hundred thousand celestial spirits, all resolved to commence the universal revolution to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nBaron Everdingen exclaimed that they were crazy, that he would not give a _sou_, that it was both criminal and mad to attack the most admirable thing in the world, the thing which renders earth more beautiful than heaven--Finance. He was a poet and a prophet. His heart thrilled with holy enthusiasm; he drew attention to the French Savings Bank, the virtuous Savings Bank, that chaste and pure Savings Bank like unto the Virgin of the Canticle who, issuing from the depths of the country in rustic petticoat, bears to the robust and splendid Bank--her bridegroom, who awaits her--the treasures of her love; and drew a picture of the Bank, enriched with the gifts of its spouse, pouring on all the nations of the world torrents of gold, which, of themselves, by a thousand invisible channels return in still greater abundance to the blessed land from which they sprung.\r\n\r\n\"By Deposit and Loan,\" he went on, \"France has become the New Jerusalem, shedding her glory over all the nations of Europe, and the Kings of the Earth come to kiss her rosy feet. And that is what you would fain destroy? You are both impious and sacrilegious.\"\r\n\r\nThus spoke the angel of finance. An invisible harp accompanied his voice, and his eyes darted lightning.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Arcade, leaning carelessly against the Regent's bureau, spread out under the Banker's eyes various ground-plans, underground-plans, and sky-plans of Paris with red crosses indicating the points where bombs should be simultaneously placed in cellars and catacombs, thrown on public ways, and flung by a flotilla of aeroplanes. All the financial establishments, and notably the Everdingen Bank and its branches, were marked with red crosses.\r\n\r\nThe financier shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! you are but wretches and vagabonds, shadowed by all the police of the world. You are penniless. How can you manufacture all the machines?\"\r\n\r\nBy way of reply, Prince Istar drew from his pocket a small copper cylinder, which he gracefully presented to Baron Everdingen.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" said he, \"this ordinary-looking box. It is only necessary to let it fall on the ground immediately to reduce this mansion with its inmates to a mass of smoking ashes, and to set a fire going which would devour all the Trocad\\xc3\\xa9ro quarter. I have ten thousand like that, and I make three dozen a day.\"\r\n\r\nThe financier asked the Cherub to replace the machine in his pocket, and continued in a conciliatory tone:\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me, my friends. Go and start a revolution at once in Heaven, and leave things alone in this country. I will sign a cheque for you. You can procure all the material you need to attack celestial Jerusalem.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Baron Everdingen was already working up in his imagination a magnificent deal in electrophores and war-material.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n     WHEREIN IS BEGUN THE GARDENER'S STORY, IN THE COURSE OF      WHICH WE SHALL SEE THE DESTINY OF THE WORLD UNFOLDED IN A      DISCOURSE AS BROAD AND MAGNIFICENT IN ITS VIEWS AS BOSSUET'S      DISCOURSE ON THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE IS NARROW AND      DISMAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gardener bade Arcade and Zita sit down in an arbour walled with wild bryony, at the far end of the orchard.\r\n\r\n\"Arcade,\" said the beautiful Archangel, \"Nectaire will perhaps reveal to you to-day the things you are burning to know. Ask him to speak.\"\r\n\r\nArcade did so and old Nectaire, laying down his pipe, began as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"I knew him. He was the most beautiful of all the Seraphim. He shone with intelligence and daring. His great heart was big with all the virtues born of pride: frankness, courage, constancy in trial, indomitable hope. Long, long ago, ere Time was, in the boreal sky where gleam the seven magnetic stars, he dwelt in a palace of diamond and gold, where the air was ever tremulous with the beating of wings and with songs of triumph. Iahveh, on his mountain, was jealous of Lucifer. You both know it: angels like unto men feel love and hatred quicken within them. Capable, at times, of generous resolves, they too often follow their own interests and yield to fear. Then, as now, they showed themselves, for the most part, incapable of lofty thoughts, and in the fear of the Lord lay their sole virtue. Lucifer, who held vile things in proud disdain, despised this rabble of commonplace spirits for ever wallowing in a life of feasts and pleasure. But to those who were possessed of a daring spirit, a restless soul, to those fired with a wild love of liberty, he proffered friendship, which was returned with adoration. These latter deserted in a mass the mountain of God and yielded to the Seraph the homage which That Other would fain have kept for himself alone.\r\n\r\n\"I ranked among the Dominations, and my name, Alaciel, was not unknown to fame. To satisfy my mind--that was ever tormented with an insatiable thirst for knowledge and understanding--I observed the nature of things, I studied the properties of minerals, air, and water. I sought out the laws which govern nature, solid or ethereal, and after much pondering I perceived that the Universe had not been formed as its pretended Creator would have us believe; I knew that all that exists, exists of itself and not by the caprice of Iahveh; that the world is itself its own creator and the spirit its own God. Henceforth I despised Iahveh for his imposture, and I hated him because he showed himself to be opposed to all that I found desirable and good: liberty, curiosity, doubt. These feelings drew me towards the Seraph. I admired him, I loved him. I dwelt in his light. When at length it appeared that a choice had to be made between him and That Other I ranged myself on the side of Lucifer and knew no other aim than to serve him, no other desire than to share his lot.\r\n\r\n\"War having become inevitable, he prepared for it with indefatigable vigilance and all the resourcefulness of a far-seeing mind. Making the Thrones and Dominations into Chalybes and Cyclopes, he drew forth iron from the mountains bordering his domain; iron, which he valued more than gold, and forged weapons in the caverns of Heaven. Then in the desert plain of the North he assembled myriads of Spirits, armed them, taught them, and drilled them. Although prepared in secret, the enterprise was too vast for his adversary not to be soon aware of it. It might in truth be said that he had always foreseen and dreaded it, for he had made a citadel of his abode and a warlike host of his angels, and he gave himself the name of the God of Hosts. He made ready his thunderbolts. More than half of the children of Heaven remained faithful to him; thronging round him he beheld obedient souls and patient hearts. The Archangel Michael, who knew not fear, took command of these docile troops. Lucifer, as soon as he saw that his army could gain no more in numbers or in warlike skill, moved it swiftly against the foe, and promising his angels riches and glory marched at their head towards the mountain upon whose summit stands the Throne of the Universe. For three days our host swept onward over the ethereal plains. Above our heads streamed the black standards of revolt. And now, behold, the Mountain of God shone rosy in the orient sky and our chief scanned with his eyes the glittering ramparts. Beneath the sapphire walls the foe was drawn up in battle array, and, while we marched clad in our iron and bronze, they shone resplendent in gold and precious stones.\r\n\r\n\"Their gonfalons of red and blue floated in the breeze, and lightning flashed from the points of their lances. In a little while the armies were only sundered one from the other by a narrow strip of level and deserted ground, and at this sight even the bravest shuddered as they thought that there in bloody conflict their fate would soon be sealed.\r\n\r\n\"Angels, as you know, never die. But when bronze and iron, diamond point or flaming sword tear their ethereal substance, the pain they feel is more acute than men may suffer, for their flesh is more exquisitely delicate; and should some essential organ be destroyed, they fall inert and, slowly decomposing, are resolved into clouds and during long \\xc3\\xa6ons float insensible in the cold ether. And when at length they resume spirit and form they fail to recover full memory of their past life. Therefore it is but natural that angels shrink from suffering, and the bravest among them is troubled at the thought of being reft of light and sweet remembrance. Were it otherwise the angelic race would know neither the delight of battle nor the glory of sacrifice. Those who, before the beginning of Time, fought in the Empyrean for or against the God of Armies, would have taken part without honour in mock battles, and it would not now become me to say to you, my children, with rightful pride:\r\n\r\n\"'Lo, I was there!'\r\n\r\n\"Lucifer gave the signal for the onset and led the assault. We fell upon the enemy, thinking to destroy him then and there and carry the sacred citadel at the first onslaught. The soldiers of the jealous God, less fiery, but no whit less firm than ours, remained immovable. The Archangel Michael commanded them with the calmness and resolution of a mighty spirit. Thrice we strove to break through their lines, thrice they opposed to our ironclad breast the flaming points of their lances, swift to pierce the stoutest cuirass. In millions the glorious bodies fell. At length our right wing pierced the enemy's left and we beheld the Principalities, the Powers, the Virtues, the Dominations, and the Thrones turn and flee in full career; while the Angels of the Third Choir, flying distractedly above them, covered them with a snow of feathers mingled with a rain of blood. We sped in pursuit of them amid the d\\xc3\\xa9bris of chariots and broken weapons, and we spurred their nimble flight. Suddenly a storm of cries amazed us. It grew louder and nearer. With desperate shrieks and triumphal clamour the right wing of the enemy, the giant archangels of the Most High, had flung themselves upon our left flank and broken it. Thus we were forced to abandon the pursuit of the fugitives and hasten to the rescue of our own shattered troops. Our prince flew to rally them, and re-established the conflict. But the left wing of the enemy, whose ruin he had not quite consummated, no longer pressed by lance or arrow, regained courage, returned, and faced us yet again. Night fell upon the dubious field. While under the shelter of darkness, in the still, silent air stirred ever and anon by the moans of the wounded, his forces were resting from their toils, Lucifer began to make ready for the next day's battle. Before dawn the trumpets sounded the reveille. Our warriors surprised the enemy at the hour of prayer, put them to rout, and long and fierce was the carnage that ensued. When all had either fallen or fled, the Archangel Michael, none with him save a few companions with four wings of flame, still resisted the onslaughts of a countless host. They fell back ceaselessly opposing their breasts to us, and Michael still displayed an impassible countenance. The sun had run a third of its course when we commenced to scale the Mountain of God. An arduous ascent it was: sweat ran from our brows, a dazzling light blinded us. Weighed down with steel, our feathery wings could not sustain us, but hope gave us wings that bore us up. The beautiful Seraph, pointing with glittering hand, mounting ever higher and higher, showed us the way. All day long we slowly clomb the lofty heights which at evening were robed in azure, rose, and violet. The starry host appearing in the sky seemed as the reflection of our own arms. Infinite silence reigned above us. We went on, intoxicated with hope; all at once from the darkened sky lightning darted forth, the thunder muttered, and from the cloudy mountain-top fell fire from Heaven. Our helmets, our breast-plates were running with flames, and our bucklers broke under bolts sped by invisible hands. Lucifer, in the storm of fire, retained his haughty mien. In vain the lightning smote him; mightier than ever he stood erect, and still defied the foe. At length, the thunder, making the mountain totter, flung us down pell-mell, huge fragments of sapphire and ruby crashing down with us as we fell, and we rolled inert, swooning, for a period whose duration none could measure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I awoke in a darkness filled with lamentations. And when my eyes had grown accustomed to the dense shadows I saw round me my companions in arms, scattered in thousands on the sulphurous ground, lit by fitful gleams of livid light. My eyes perceived but fields of lava, smoking craters, and poisonous swamps.\r\n\r\n\"Mountains of ice and shadowy seas shut in the horizon. A brazen sky hung heavy on our brows. And the horror of the place was such that we wept as we sat, crouched elbow on knee, our cheeks resting on our clenched hands.\r\n\r\n\"But soon, raising my eyes, I beheld the Seraph standing before me like a tower. Over his pristine splendour sorrow had cast its mantle of sombre majesty.\r\n\r\n\"'Comrades,' said he, 'we must be happy and rejoice, for behold we are delivered from celestial servitude. Here we are free, and it were better to be free in Hell than serve in Heaven. We are not conquered, since the will to conquer is still ours. We have caused the Throne of the jealous God to totter; by our hands it shall fall. Arise, therefore, and be of good heart.'\r\n\r\n\"Thereupon, at his command, we piled mountain upon mountain and on the topmost peak we reared engines which flung molten rocks against the divine habitations. The celestial host was taken unaware and from the abodes of glory there issued groans and cries of terror. And even then we thought to re-enter in triumph on our high estate, but the Mountain of God was wreathed with lightnings, and thunderbolts, falling on our fortress, crushed it to dust. After this fresh disaster, the Seraph remained awhile in meditation, his head buried in his hands. At length he raised his darkened visage. Now he was Satan, greater than Lucifer. Steadfast and loyal the angels thronged about him.\r\n\r\n\"'Friends,' he said, 'if victory is denied us now, it is because we are neither worthy nor capable of victory. Let us determine wherein we have failed. Nature shall not be ruled, the sceptre of the Universe shall not be grasped, Godhead shall not be won, save by knowledge alone. We must conquer the thunder; to that task we must apply ourselves unwearyingly. It is not blind courage (no one this day has shown more courage than have you) which will win us the courts of Heaven; but rather study and reflection. In these silent realms where we are fallen, let us meditate, seeking the hidden causes of things; let us observe the course of Nature; let us pursue her with compelling ardour and all-conquering desire; let us strive to penetrate her infinite grandeur, her infinite minuteness. Let us seek to know when she is barren and when she brings forth fruit; how she makes cold and heat, joy and sorrow, life and death; how she assembles and disperses her elements, how she produces both the light air we breathe and the rocks of diamond and sapphire whence we have been precipitated, the divine fire wherewith we have been scarred and the soaring thought which stirs our minds. Torn with dire wounds, scorched by flame and by ice, let us render thanks to Fate which has sedulously opened our eyes, and let us rejoice at our lot. It is through pain that, suffering a first experience of Nature, we have been roused to know her and to subdue her. When she obeys us we shall be as gods. But even though she hide her mysteries for ever from us, deny us arms and keep the secret of the thunder, we still must needs congratulate ourselves on having known pain, for pain has revealed to us new feelings, more precious and more sweet than those experienced in eternal bliss, and inspired us with love and pity unknown to Heaven.'\r\n\r\n\"These words of the Seraph changed our hearts and opened up fresh hope to us. Our hearts were filled with a great longing for knowledge and love.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile the Earth was coming into being. Its immense and nebulous orb took on hourly more shape and more certainty of outline. The waters which fed the seaweed, the madrepores and shellfish and bore the light flotilla of the nautilus upon their bosom, no longer covered it in its entirety; they began to sink into beds, and already continents appeared, where, on the warm slime, amphibious monsters crawled. Then the mountains were overspread with forests, and divers races of animals commenced to feed on the grass, the moss, the berries on the trees, and on the acorns. Then there took possession of cavernous shelters under the rocks, a being who was cunning to wound with a sharpened stone the savage beasts, and by his ruses to overcome the ancient denizens of forest, plain, and mountain.\r\n\r\n\"Man entered painfully on his kingdom. He was defenceless and naked. His scanty hair afforded him but little protection from the cold. His hands ended in nails too frail to do battle with the claws of wild beasts, but the position of his thumb, in opposition to the rest of his fingers, allowed him easily to grasp the most diverse objects and endowed him with skill in default of strength. Without differing essentially from the rest of the animals, he was more capable than any others of observing and comparing. As he drew from his throat various sounds, it occurred to him to designate by a particular inflexion of the voice whatever impinged upon his mind, and by this sequence of different sounds he was enabled to fix and communicate his ideas. His miserable lot and his painstaking spirit aroused the sympathy of the vanquished angels, who discerned in him an audacity equalling their own, and the germ of the pride that was at once their glory and their bane. They came in large numbers to be near him, to dwell on this young earth whither their wings wafted them in effortless flight. And they took pleasure in sharpening his talents and fostering his genius. They taught him to clothe himself in the skins of wild beasts, to roll stones before the mouths of caves to keep out the tigers and bears. They taught him how to make the flame burst forth by twirling a stick among the dried leaves and to foster the sacred fire upon the hearth. Inspired by the ingenious spirits he dared to cross the rivers in the hollowed trunks of cleft trees, he invented the wheel, the grinding-mill, and the plough; the share tore up the earth and the wound brought forth fruit, and the grain offered to him who ground it divine nourishment. He moulded vessels in clay, and out of the flint he fashioned various tools.\r\n\r\n\"In fine, taking up our abode among mankind, we consoled them and taught them. We were not always visible to them, but of an evening, at the turn of the road, we would appear to them under forms often strange and weird, at times dignified and charming, and we adopted at will the appearance of a monster of the woods and waters, of a venerable old man, of a beautiful child, or of a woman with broad hips. Sometimes we would mock them in our songs or test their intelligence by some cunning prank. There were certain of us of a rather turbulent humour who loved to tease their women and children, but though lowly folk, they were our brothers, and we were never loath to come to their aid. Through our care their intelligence developed sufficiently to attain to mistaken ideas, and to acquire erroneous notions of the relations of cause and effect. As they supposed that some magic bond existed between the reality and its counterfeit presentment, they covered the walls of their caves with figures of animals and carved in ivory images of the reindeer and the mammoth in order to secure as prey the creatures they represented. Centuries passed by with infinite slowness while their genius was coming to birth. We sent them happy thoughts in dreams, inspired them to tame the horse, to castrate the bull, to teach the dog to guard the sheep. They created the family and the tribe. It came to pass one day that one of their wandering tribes was assailed by ferocious hunters. Forthwith the young men of the tribe formed an enclosed ring with their chariots, and in it they shut their women, children, old people, cattle, and treasures, and from the platform of their chariots they hurled murderous stones at their assailants. Thus was formed the first city. Born in misery and condemned to do murder by the law of Iahveh, man put his whole heart into doing battle, and to war he was indebted for his noblest virtues. He hallowed with his blood that sacred love of country which should (if man fulfils his destiny to the very end) enfold the whole earth in peace. One of us, D\\xc3\\xa6dalus, brought him the axe, the plumb-line, and the sail. Thus we rendered the existence of mortals less hard and difficult. By the shores of the lakes they built dwellings of osier, where they might enjoy a meditative quiet unknown to the other inhabitants of the earth, and when they had learned to appease their hunger without too painful efforts we breathed into their hearts the love of beauty.\r\n\r\n\"They raised up pyramids, obelisks, towers, colossal statues which smiled stiff and uncouth, and genetic symbols. Having learnt to know us or trying at least to divine what manner of beings we were, they felt both friendship and fear for us. The wisest among them watched us with sacred awe and pondered our teaching. In their gratitude the people of Greece and of Asia consecrated to us stones, trees, shadowy woods; offered us victims, and sang us hymns; in fact we became gods in their sight, and they called us Horus, Isis, Astarte, Zeus, Cybele, Demeter, and Triptolemus. Satan was worshipped under the names of Evan, Dionysus, Iacchus, and Len\\xc3\\xa6us. He showed in his various manifestations all the strength and beauty which it is given to mortals to conceive. His eyes had the sweetness of the wood-violet, his lips were brilliant with the ruby-red of the pomegranate, a down finer than the velvet of the peach covered his cheeks and his chin: his fair hair, wound like a diadem and knotted loosely on the crown of his head, was encircled with ivy. He charmed the wild beasts, and penetrating into the deep forests drew to him all wild spirits, every thing that climbed in trees and peered through the branches with wild and timid gaze. On all these creatures fierce and fearful, that lived on bitter berries and beneath whose hairy breasts a wild heart beat, half-human creatures of the woods--on all he bestowed loving-kindness and grace, and they followed him drunk with joy and beauty. He planted the vine and showed mortals how to crush the grapes underfoot to make the wine flow. Magnificent and benign, he fared across the world, a long procession following in his train. To bear him company I took the form of a satyr; from my brow sprang two budding horns. My nose was flat and my ears were pointed. Glands, like those of the goat, hung on my neck, a goat's tail moved with my moving loins, and my hairy legs ended in a black cloven hoof which beat the ground in cadence.\r\n\r\n\"Dionysus fared on his triumphal march over the world. In his company I passed through Lydia, the Phrygian fields, the scorching plains of Persia, Media bristling with hoar-frost, Arabia Felix, and rich Asia where flourishing cities were laved by the waves of the sea. He proceeded on a car drawn by lions and lynxes, to the sound of flutes, cymbals, and drums, invented for his mysteries. Bacchantes, Thyades, and M\\xc3\\xa6nads, girt with the dappled fawn-skin, waved the thyrsus encircled with ivy. He bore in his train the Satyrs, whose joyous troop I led, Sileni, Pans, and Centaurs. Under his feet flowers and fruit sprang to life, and striking the rocks with his wand he made limpid streams gush forth. In the month of the Vintage he visited Greece, and the villagers ran forth to meet him, stained with the green and ruddy juices of the plants, they wore masks of wood, or bark, or leaves; in their hands they bore earthen cups, and danced wanton dances. Their womenfolk, imitating the companions of the God, their heads wreathed with green smilax, fastened round their supple loins skins of fawn or goat. The virgins twined about their throats garlands of fig leaves, they kneaded cakes of flour, and bore the Phallus in the mystic basket. And the vine-dressers, all daubed with lees of wine, standing up in their wains and bandying mockery or abuse with the passers-by, invented Tragedy.\r\n\r\n\"Truly, it was not in dreaming beside a fountain, but by dint of strenuous toil that Dionysus taught them to grow plants and to make them bring forth succulent fruits. And while he pondered the art of transforming the rough woodlanders into a race that should love music and submit to just laws, more than once over his brow, burning with the fire of enthusiasm, did melancholy and gloomy fever pass. But his profound knowledge and his friendship for mankind enabled him to triumph over every obstacle. O days divine! Beautiful dawn of life! We led the Bacchanals on the leafy summits of the mountains and on the yellow shores of the seas. The Naiads and the Oreads mingled with us at our play. Aphrodite at our coming rose from the foam of the sea to smile upon us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n     THE GARDENER'S STORY, CONTINUED\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When men had learned to cultivate the earth, to herd cattle, to enclose their holy places within walls, and to recognise the gods by their beauty, I withdrew to that smiling land girdled with dark woods and watered by the Stymphalos, the Olbios, the Erymanthus, and the proud Crathis, swollen with the icy waters of the Styx, and there, in a green valley at the foot of a hill planted with arbutus, olive, and pine, beneath a cluster of white poplars and plane trees, by the side of a stream flowing with soft murmur amid tufted mastic trees, I sang to the shepherds and the nymphs of the birth of the world, the origin of fire, of the tenuous air, of water and of earth. I told them how primeval men had lived wretched and naked in the woods, before the ingenious spirits had taught them the arts; of God, too, I sang to them, and why they gave Dionysus Semele to mother, because his desire to befriend mankind was born amid the thunder.\r\n\r\n\"It was not without effort that this people, more pleasing than all the others in the eyes of the gods, these happy Greeks, achieved good government and a knowledge of the arts. Their first temple was a hut composed of laurel branches; their first image of the gods, a tree; their first altar, a rough stone stained with the blood of Iphigenia. But in a short time they brought wisdom and beauty to a point that no nation had attained before them, that no nation has since approached. Whence comes it, Arcade, this solitary marvel on the earth? Wherefore did the sacred soil of Ionia and of Attica bring forth this incomparable flower? Because nor priesthood, nor dogma, nor revelation ever found a place there, because the Greeks never knew the jealous God.\r\n\r\n\"It was his own grace, his own genius that the Greek enthroned and deified as his God, and when he raised his eyes to the heavens it was his own image that he saw reflected there. He conceived everything in due measure; and to his temples he gave perfect proportion. All therein was grace, harmony, symmetry, and wisdom; all were worthy of the immortals who dwelt within them and who under names of happy choice, in realised shapes, figured forth the genius of man. The columns which bore the marble architrave, the frieze and the cornice were touched with something human, which made them venerable; and sometimes one might see, as at Athens and at Delphi, beautiful young girls strong-limbed and radiant upstaying the entablature of treasure house and sanctuary. O days of splendour, harmony, and wisdom!\r\n\r\n\"Dionysus resolved to repair to Italy, whither he was summoned under the name of Bacchus by a people eager to celebrate his mysteries. I took passage in his ship decked with tendrils of the vine, and landed under the eyes of the two brothers of Helen at the mouth of the yellow Tiber. Already under the teaching of the god, the inhabitants of Latium had learned to wed the vine to the young stripling elm. It was my pleasure to dwell at the foot of the Sabine hills in a valley crowned with trees and watered with pure springs. I gathered the verbena and the mallow in the meadows. The pale olive-trees twisting their perforated trunks on the slope of the hill gave me of their unctuous fruit. There I taught a race of men with square heads, who had not, like the Greeks, a fertile mind, but whose hearts were true, whose souls were patient, and who reverenced the gods. My neighbour, a rustic soldier, who for fifteen years had bowed under the burden of his haversack, had followed the Roman eagle over land and sea, and had seen the enemies of the sovereign people flee before him. Now he drove his furrow with his two red oxen, starred with white between their spreading horns, while beneath the cabin's thatch his spouse, chaste and sedate of mien, pounded garlic in a bronze mortar and cooked the beans upon the sacred hearth, And I, his friend, seated near by under an oak, used to lighten his labours with the sound of my flute, and smile on his little children, when the sun, already low in the sky, was lengthening the shadows, and they returned from the wood all laden with branches. At the garden gate where the pears and pumpkins ripened, and where the lily and the evergreen acanthus bloomed, a figure of Priapus carved out of the trunk of a fig tree menaced thieves with his formidable emblem, and the reeds swaying with the wind over his head scared away the plundering birds. At new moon the pious husbandman made offering of a handful of salt and barley to his household gods crowned with myrtle and with rosemary.\r\n\r\n\"I saw his children grow up, and his children's children, who kept in their hearts their early piety and did not forget to offer sacrifice to Bacchus, to Diana, and to Venus, nor omit to pour fresh wines and scatter flowers into the fountains. But slowly they fell away from their old habits of patient toil and simplicity.\r\n\r\n\"I heard them complain when the torrent, swollen with many rains, compelled them to construct a dyke to protect the paternal fields, and the rough Sabine wine grew unpleasing to their delicate palate. They went to drink the wines of Greece at the neighbouring tavern; and the hours slipped unheeded by, while within the arbour shade they watched the dance of the flute player, practised at swaying her supple limbs to the sound of the castanets.\r\n\r\n\"Lulled by murmuring leaves and whispering streams, the tillers of the soil took sweet repose, but between the poplars we saw along borders of the sacred way vast tombs, statues, and altars arise, and the rolling of the chariot wheels grew more frequent over the worn stones. A cherry sapling brought home by a veteran told us of the far-distant conquests of a Consul, and odes sung to the lyre related the victories of Rome, mistress of the world.\r\n\r\n\"All the countries where the great Dionysus had journeyed, changing wild beasts into men, and making the fruit and grain bloom and ripen beneath the passing of his M\\xc3\\xa6nads, now breathed the Pax Romana. The nursling of the she-wolf, soldier and labourer, friend of conquered nations, laid out roads from the margin of the misty sea to the rocky slopes of the Caucasus; in every town rose the temple of Augustus and of Rome, and such was the universal faith in Latin justice that in the gorges of Thessaly or on the wooded borders of the Rhine, the slave, ready to succumb under his iniquitous burden, called aloud on the name of C\\xc3\\xa6sar.\r\n\r\n\"But why must it be that on this ill-starred globe of land and water, all should perish and die and the fairest things be ever the most fleeting? O adorable daughters of Greece! O Science! O Wisdom! O Beauty! kindly divinities, you were wrapt in heavy slumber ere you submitted to the outrages of the barbarians, who already in the marshy wastes of the North and on the lonely steppes, ready to assail you, bestrode bare-backed their little shaggy horses.\r\n\r\n\"While, dear Arcade, the patient legionary camped by the borders of the Phasis and the Tanais, the women and the priests of Asia and of monstrous Africa invaded the Eternal City and troubled the sons of Remus with their magic spells. Until now, Iahveh, the persecutor of the laborious demons, was unknown to the world that he pretended to have created, save to certain miserable Syrian tribes, ferocious like himself, and perpetually dragged from servitude to servitude. Profiting by the Roman peace which assured free travel and traffic everywhere, and favoured the exchange of ideas and merchandise, this old God insolently made ready to conquer the Universe. He was not the only one, for the matter of that, to attempt such an undertaking. At the same time a crowd of gods, demiurges, and demons, such as Mithra, Thammuz, the good Isis, and Eubulus, meditated taking possession of the peace-enfolded world. Of all the spirits, Iahveh appeared the least prepared for victory. His ignorance, his cruelty, his ostentation, his Asiatic luxury, his disdain of laws, his affectation of rendering himself invisible, all these things were calculated to offend those Greeks and Latins who had absorbed the teaching of Dionysus and the Muses. He himself felt he was incapable of winning the allegiance of free men and of cultivated minds, and he employed cunning. To seduce their souls he invented a fable which, although not so ingenious as the myths wherewith we have surrounded the spirits of our disciples of old, could, nevertheless, influence those feebler intellects which are to be found everywhere in great masses. He declared that men having committed a crime against him, an hereditary crime, should pay the penalty for it in their present life and in the life to come (for mortals vainly imagine that their existence is prolonged in hell); and the astute Iahveh gave out that he had sent his own son to earth to redeem with his blood the debt of mankind. It is not credible that a penalty should redress a fault, and it is still less credible that the innocent should pay for the guilty. The sufferings of the innocent atone for nothing, and do but add one evil to another. Nevertheless, unhappy creatures were found to adore Iahveh and his son, the expiator, and to announce their mysteries as good tidings. We should not be surprised at this folly. Have we not seen many times indeed human beings who, poor and naked, prostrate themselves before all the phantoms of fear, and rather than follow the teaching of well-disposed demons, obey the commandments of cruel demiurges? Iahveh, by his cunning, took souls as in a net. But he did not gain therefrom, for his glorification, all that he expected. It was not he, but his son, who received the homage of mankind, and who gave his name to the new cult. He himself remained almost unknown upon earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n     THE GARDENER'S STORY, CONTINUED\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The new superstition spread at first over Syria and Africa; it won over the seaports where the filthy rabble swarm, and, penetrating into Italy, infected at first the courtesans and the slaves, and then made rapid progress among the middle classes of the towns. But for a long while the country-side remained undisturbed. As in the past, the villagers consecrated a pine tree to Diana, and sprinkled it every year with the blood of a young boar; they propitiated their Lares with the sacrifice of a sow, and offered to Bacchus--benefactor of mankind--a kid of dazzling whiteness, or if they were too poor for this, at least they had a little wine and a little flour from the vineyard and from the fields for their household gods. We had taught them that it sufficed to approach the altar with clean hands, and that the gods rejoiced over a modest offering.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, the reign of Iahveh proclaimed its advent in a hundred places by its extravagances. The Christians burnt books, overthrew temples, set fire to the towns, and carried on their ravages as far as the deserts. There, thousands of unhappy beings, turning their fury against themselves, lacerated their sides with points of steel. And from the whole earth the sighs of voluntary victims rose up to God like songs of praise.\r\n\r\n\"My shadowy retreat could not escape for long from the fury of their madness.\r\n\r\n\"On the summit of the hill which overlooked the olive woods, brightened daily with the sounds of my flute, had stood since the earliest days of the Pax Romana, a small marble temple, round as the huts of our forefathers. It had no walls, but on a base of seven steps, sixteen columns rose in a circle with the acanthus on the capitals, bearing a cupola of white tiles. This cupola sheltered a statue of Love fashioning his bow, the work of an Athenian sculptor. The child seemed to breathe, joy was welling from his lips, all his limbs were harmonious and polished. I honoured this image of the most powerful of all the gods, and I taught the villagers to bear to him as an offering a cup crowned with verbena and filled with wine two summers old.\r\n\r\n\"One day, when seated as my custom was at the feet of the god, pondering precepts and songs, an unknown man, wild-looking, with unkempt hair, approached the temple, sprang at one bound up the marble steps, and with savage glee exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"'Die, poisoner of souls, and joy and beauty perish with you.' He spoke thus, and drawing an axe from his girdle raised it against the god. I stayed his arm, I threw him down, and trampled him under my feet.\r\n\r\n\"'Demon,' he cried desperately, 'suffer me to overturn this idol, and you may slay me afterwards.'\r\n\r\n\"I heeded not his atrocious plea, but leaned with all my might on his chest, which cracked under my knee, and, squeezing his throat with my two hands, I strangled the impious one.\r\n\r\n\"While he lay there, with purple face and lolling tongue, at the feet of the smiling god, I went to purify myself at the sacred stream. Then leaving this land, now the prey of the Christian, I passed through Gaul and gained the banks of the Sa\\xc3\\xb4ne, whither Dionysus had, in days gone by, carried the vine. The god of the Christians had not yet been proclaimed to this happy people. They worshipped for its beauty a leafy beech-tree, whose honoured branches swept the ground, and they hung fillets of wool thereon. They also worshipped a sacred stream and set up images of clay in a dripping grotto. They made offering of little cheeses and a bowl of milk to the Nymphs of the woods and mountains.\r\n\r\n\"But soon an apostle of sorrow was sent to them by the new God. He was drier than a smoked fish. Although attenuated with fasting and watching, he taught with unabated ardour all manner of gloomy mysteries. He loved suffering, and thought it good; his anger fell upon all that was beautiful, comely, and joyous. The sacred tree fell beneath his hatchet. He hated the Nymphs, because they were beautiful, and he flung imprecations at them when their shining limbs gleamed among the leaves at evening, and he held my melodious flute in aversion. The poor wretch thought that there were certain forms of words wherewith to put to flight the deathless spirits that dwell in the cool groves, and in the depths of the woods and on the tops of the mountains. He thought to conquer us with a few drops of water over which he had pronounced certain words and made certain gestures. The Nymphs, to avenge themselves, appeared to him at nightfall and inflamed him with desire which the foolish knave thought animal; then they fled, their laughter scattered like grain over the fields, while their victim lay tossing with burning limbs on his couch of leaves. Thus do the divine nymphs laugh at exorcisers, and mock the wicked and their sordid chastity.\r\n\r\n\"The apostle did not do as much harm as he wished, because his teaching was given to the simple souls living in obedience to Nature, and because the mediocrity of most of mankind is such that they gain but little from the principles inculcated in them. The little wood in which I dwelt belonged to a Gaul of senatorial family, who retained some traces of Latin elegance. He loved his young freed-woman and shared with her his bed of broidered purple. His slaves cultivated his garden and his vineyard; he was a poet and sang, in imitation of Ausonius, Venus whipping her son with roses. Although a Christian, he offered me milk, fruit, and vegetables as if I were the genius of the place. In return I charmed his idle moments with the music of my flute, and I gave him happy dreams. In fact, these peaceful Gauls knew very little of Iahveh and his son.\r\n\r\n\"But now behold fires looming on the horizon, and ashes driven by the wind fall within our forest glades. Peasants come driving a long file of waggons along the roads or urging their flocks before them. Cries of terror rise from the villages, 'The Burgundians are upon us!'\r\n\r\n\"Now one horseman is seen, lance in hand, clad in shining bronze, his long red hair falling in two plaits on his shoulders. Then come two, then twenty, then thousands, wild and blood-stained; old men and children they put to the sword, ay, even aged grandams whose grey hairs cleave to the soles of the slaughterer's boots, mingled with the brains of babes new-born. My young Gaul and his young freed-woman stain with their blood the couch broidered with narcissi. The barbarians burn the basilicas to roast their oxen whole, shatter the amphor\\xc3\\xa6, and drain the wine in the mud of the flooded cellars. Their women accompany them, huddled, half naked, in their war chariots. When the Senate, the dwellers in the cities, and the leaders of the churches had perished in the flames, the Burgundians, soddened with wine, lay down to slumber beneath the arcades of the Forum. Two weeks later one of them might have been seen smiling in his shaggy beard at the little child whom, on the threshold of their dwelling, his fair-haired spouse gathers in her arms; while another, kindling the fire of his forge, hammers out his iron with measured stroke; another sings beneath the oak tree to his assembled comrades of the gods and heroes of his race; and yet others spread out for sale stones fallen from Heaven, aurochs' horns, and amulets. And the former inhabitants of the country, regaining courage little by little, crept from the woods where they had fled for refuge, and returned to rebuild their burnt-down cabins, plough their fields, and prune their vines.\r\n\r\n\"Once more life resumed its normal course; but those times were the most wretched that mankind had yet experienced. The barbarians swarmed over the whole Empire. Their ways were uncouth, and as they nurtured feelings of vengeance and greed, they firmly believed in the ransom of sin.\r\n\r\n\"The fable of Iahveh and his son pleased them, and they believed it all the more easily in that it was taught them by the Romans whom they knew to be wiser than themselves, and to whose arts and mode of life they yielded secret admiration. Alas! the heritage of Greece and Rome had fallen into the hands of fools. All knowledge was lost. In those days it was held to be a great merit to sing among the choir, and those who remembered a few sentences from the Bible passed for prodigious geniuses. There were still poets as there were birds, but their verse went lame in every foot. The ancient demons, the good genii of mankind, shorn of their honours, driven forth, pursued, hunted down, remained hidden in the woods. There, if they still showed themselves to men, they adopted, to hold them in awe, a terrible face, a red, green, or black skin, baleful eyes, an enormous mouth fringed with boars' teeth, horns, a tail, and sometimes a human face on their bellies. The nymphs remained fair, and the barbarians, ignorant of the winsome names they bore in other days, called them fairies, and, imputing to them a capricious character and puerile tastes, both feared and loved them.\r\n\r\n\"We had suffered a grievous fall, and our ranks were sadly thinned; nevertheless we did not lose courage and, maintaining a laughing aspect and a benevolent spirit, we were in those direful days the real friends of mankind. Perceiving that the barbarians grew daily less sombre and less ferocious, we lent ourselves to the task of conversing with them under all sorts of disguises. We incited them, with a thousand precautions, and by prudent circumlocutions, not to acknowledge the old Iahveh as an infallible master, not blindly to obey his orders, and not to fear his menaces. When need was, we had recourse to magic. We exhorted them unceasingly to study nature and to strive to discover the traces of ancient wisdom.\r\n\r\n\"These warriors from the North--rude though they were--were acquainted with some mechanical arts. They thought they saw combats in the heavens; the sound of the harp drew tears from their eyes; and perchance they had souls capable of greater things than the degenerate Gauls and Romans whose lands they had invaded. They knew not how to hew stone or to polish marble; but they caused porphyry and columns to be brought from Rome and from Ravenna; their chief men took for their seal a gem engraved by a Greek in the days when Beauty reigned supreme. They raised walls with bricks, cunningly arranged like ears of corn, and succeeded in building quite pleasing-looking churches with cornices upheld by consoles depicting grim faces, and heavy capitals whereon were represented monsters devouring one another.\r\n\r\n\"We taught them letters and sciences. A mouthpiece of their god, one Gerbert, took lessons in physics, arithmetic, and music with us, and it was said that he had sold us his soul. Centuries passed, and man's ways remained violent. It was a world given up to fire and blood. The successors of the studious Gerbert, not content with the possession of souls (the profits one gains thereby are lighter than air), wished to possess bodies also. They pretended that their universal and prescriptive monarchy was held from a fisherman on the lake of Tiberias. One of them thought for a moment to prevail over the loutish Germanus, successor to Augustus. But finally the spiritual had to come to terms with the temporal, and the nations were torn between two opposing masters.\r\n\r\n\"Nations took shape amid horrible tumult. On every side were wars, famines, and internecine conflicts. Since they attributed the innumerable ills that fell upon them to their God, they called him the Most Good, not by way of irony, but because to them the best was he who smote the hardest. In those days of violence, to give myself leisure for study I adopted a _r\\xc3\\xb4le_ which may surprise you, but which was exceedingly wise.\r\n\r\n\"Between the Sa\\xc3\\xb4ne and the mountains of Charolais, where the cattle pasture, there lies a wooded hill sloping gently down to fields watered by a clear stream. There stood a monastery celebrated throughout the Christian world. I hid my cloven feet under a robe and became a monk in this Abbey, where I lived peacefully, sheltered from the men at arms who to friend or foe alike showed themselves equally exacting. Man, who had relapsed into childhood, had all his lessons to learn over again. Brother Luke, whose cell was next to mine, studied the habits of animals and taught us that the weasel conceives her young within her ear. I culled simples in the fields wherewith to soothe the sick, who until then were made by way of treatment to touch the relics of saints. In the Abbey were several demons similar to myself whom I recognised by their cloven feet and by their kindly speech. We joined forces in our endeavours to polish the rough mind of the monks.\r\n\r\n\"While the little children played at hop-scotch under the Abbey walls our friends the monks devoted themselves to another game equally unprofitable, at which, nevertheless, I joined them, for one must kill time,--that, when one comes to think of it, is the sole business of life. Our game was a game of words which pleased our coarse yet subtle minds, set school fulminating against school, and put all Christendom in an uproar. We formed ourselves into two opposing camps. One camp maintained that before there were apples there was the Apple; that before there were popinjays there was the Popinjay; that before there were lewd and greedy monks there was the Monk, Lewdness and Greed; that before there were feet and before there were posteriors in this world the kick in the posterior must have had existence for all eternity in the bosom of God. The other camp replied that, on the contrary, apples gave man the idea of the apple; popinjays the idea of the popinjay; monks the idea of the monk, greed and lewdness, and that the kick in the posterior existed only after having been duly given and received. The players grew heated and came to fisticuffs. I was an adherent of the second party, which satisfied my reason better, and which was, in fact, condemned by the Council of Soissons.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, not content with fighting among themselves, vassal against suzerain, suzerain against vassal, the great lords took it into their heads to go and fight in the East. They said, as well as I can remember, that they were going to deliver the tomb of the son of God.\r\n\r\n\"They said so, but their adventurous and covetous spirit excited them to go forth and seek lands, women, slaves, gold, myrrh, and incense. These expeditions, need it be said, proved disastrous; but our thick-headed compatriots brought back with them the knowledge of certain crafts and oriental arts and a taste for luxury. Henceforth we had less difficulty in making them work and in putting them in the way of inventions. We built wonderfully beautiful churches, with daringly pierced arches, lancet-shaped windows, high towers, thousands of pointed spires, which, rising in the sky towards Iahveh, bore at one and the same time the prayers of the humble and the threats of the proud, for it was all as much our doing as the work of men's hands; and it was a strange sight to see men and demons working together at a cathedral, each one sawing, polishing, collecting stones, graving, on capital and on cornice, nettles, thorns, thistles, wild parsley, and wild strawberry,--carving faces of virgins and saints and weird figures of serpents, fishes with asses' heads, apes scratching their buttocks; each one, in fact, putting his own particular talent,--mocking, sublime, grotesque, modest, or audacious,--into the work and making of it all a harmonious cacophony, a rapturous anthem of joy and sorrow, a Babel of victory. At our instigation the carvers, the gold-smiths, the enamellers, accomplished marvels and all the sumptuary arts flourished at once; there were silks at Lyons, tapestries at Arras, linen at Rheims, cloth at Rouen. The good merchants rode on their palfreys to the fairs, bearing pieces of velvet and brocade, embroideries, orfrays, jewels, vessels of silver, and illuminated books. Strollers and players set up their trestles in the churches and in the public squares, and represented, according to their lights, simple chronicles of Heaven, Earth, and Hell. Women decked themselves in splendid raiment and lisped of love.\r\n\r\n\"In the spring when the sky was blue, nobles and peasants were possessed with the desire to make merry in the flower-strewn meadows. The fiddler tuned his instrument, and ladies, knights and demoiselles, townsfolk, villagers and maidens, holding hands, began the dance. But suddenly War, Pestilence, and Famine entered the circle, and Death, tearing the violin from the fiddler's hands, led the dance. Fire devoured village and monastery. The men-at-arms hanged the peasants on the sign-posts at the cross-roads when they were unable to pay ransom, and bound pregnant women to tree-trunks, where at night the wolves came and devoured the fruit within the womb. The poor people lost their senses. Sometimes, peace being re-established, and good times come again, they were seized with mad, unreasoning terror, abandoned their homes, and rushed hither and thither in troops, half naked, tearing themselves with iron hooks, and singing. I do not accuse Iahveh and his son of all this evil. Many ill things occurred without him and even in spite of him. But where I recognise the instigation of the All Good (as they called him) was in the custom instituted by his pastors, and established throughout Christendom, of burning, to the sound of bells and the singing of psalms, both men and women who, taught by the demons, professed, concerning this God, opinions of their own.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n     THE GARDENER'S STORY, CONCLUDED\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It seemed as if science and thought had perished for all eternity, and that the earth would never again know peace, joy, and beauty.\r\n\r\n\"But one day, under the walls of Rome, some workmen, excavating the earth on the borders of an ancient road, found a marble sarcophagus which bore carved on its sides simulacra of Love and the triumphs of Bacchus.\r\n\r\n\"The lid being raised, a maiden appeared whose face shone with dazzling freshness. Her long hair spread over her white shoulders, she was smiling in her sleep. A band of citizens, thrilled with enthusiasm, raised the funeral couch and bore it to the Capitol. The people came in crowds to contemplate the ineffable beauty of the Roman maiden and stood around in silence, watching for the awakening of the divine soul held within this form of adorable beauty.\r\n\r\n\"And it came to pass that the City was so greatly stirred by this spectacle that the Pope, fearing, not without reason, the birth of a pagan cult from this radiant body, caused it to be removed at night and secretly buried. The precaution was vain, the labour fruitless. After so many centuries of barbarism, the beauty of the antique world had appeared for a moment before the eyes of men; it was long enough for its image, graven on their hearts, to inspire them with an ardent desire to love and to know.\r\n\r\n\"Henceforth, the star of the God of the Christians paled and sloped to its decline. Bold navigators discovered worlds inhabited by numerous races who knew not old Iahveh, and it was suspected that he was no less ignorant of them, since he had given them no news of himself or of his son the expiator. A Polish Canon demonstrated the true motions of the earth, and it was seen that, far from having created the world, the old demiurge of Israel had not even an inkling of its structure. The writings of philosophers, orators, jurisconsults, and ancient poets were dragged from the dust of the cloisters and passing from hand to hand inspired men's minds with the love of wisdom. The Vicar of the jealous God, the Pope himself, no longer believed in Him whom he represented on earth. He loved the arts and had no other care than to collect ancient statues and to rear sumptuous buildings wherein were displayed the orders of Vitruvius re-established by Bramante. We began to breathe anew. Already the old gods, recalled from their long exile, were returning to dwell upon earth. There they found once more their temples and their altars. Leo, placing at their feet the ring, the three crowns, and the keys, offered them in secret the incense of sacrifices. Already Polyhymnia, leaning on her elbow, had begun to resume the golden thread of her meditations; already, in the gardens, the comely Graces and the Nymphs and Satyrs were weaving their mazy dances, and at length the earth had joy once more within its grasp. But, O calamity, unlucky fate,--most tragic circumstance! A German monk, all swollen with beer and theology, rose up against this renaissance of paganism, hurled menaces against it, shattered it, and prevailed single handed against the Princes of the Church. Inciting the nations, he called upon them to undertake a reform which saved that which was about to be destroyed. Vainly did the cleverest among us try to turn him from his work. A subtle demon, on earth called Beelzebub, marked him out for attack, now embarrassing him with learned controversial argument, now tormenting him with cruel mockery. The stubborn monk hurled his ink-pot at his head and went on with his dismal reformation. What ultimately happened? The sturdy mariner repaired, calked, and refloated the damaged ship of the Church. Jesus Christ owes it to this shaveling that his shipwreck was delayed for perhaps more than ten centuries. Henceforth things went from bad to worse. In the wake of this loutish monk, this beer-swiller and brawler, came that tall, dry doctor from Geneva, who, filled with the spirit of the ancient Iahveh, strove to bring the world back again to the abominable days of Joshua and the Judges of Israel. A maniac was he, filled with cold fury, a heretic and a burner of heretics, the most ferocious enemy of the Graces.\r\n\r\n\"These mad apostles and their mad disciples made even demons like myself, even the horned devils, look back longingly on the time when the Son with his Virgin Mother reigned over the nations dazzled with splendours: cathedrals with their stone tracery delicate as lace, flaming roses of stained glass, frescoes painted in vivid colours telling countless wondrous tales, rich orfrays, glittering enamel of shrines and reliquaries, gold of crosses and of monstrances, waxen tapers gleaming like starry galaxies amid the gloom of vaulted arches, organs with their deep-toned harmonies. All this doubtless was not the Parthenon, nor yet the Panathen\\xc3\\xa6a, but it gladdened eyes and hearts; it was, at all events, beauty. And these cursed reformers would not suffer anything either pleasing or lovable. You should have seen them climbing in black swarms over doorways, plinths, spires, and bell-towers, striking with senseless hammers those images in stone which the demons had carved working hand in hand with the master designers, those genial saints and dear, holy women, and the touching idols of Virgin Mothers pressing their suckling to their heart. For, to be just, a little agreeable paganism had slipped into the cult of the jealous God. These monsters of heretics were for extirpating idolatry. We did our best, my companions and I, to hamper their horrible work, and I, for one, had the pleasure of flinging down some dozens from the top of the porches and galleries on to the Cathedral Square, where their detestable brains got knocked out. The worst of it was that the Catholic Church also reformed herself and grew more mischievous than ever. In the pleasant land of France, the seminarists and the monks were inflamed with unheard-of fury against the ingenious demons and the men of learning. My prior was one of the most violent opponents of sound knowledge. For some time past my studious lucubrations had caused him anxiety, and perhaps he had caught sight of my cloven foot. The scoundrel searched my cell and found paper, ink, some Greek books newly printed, and some Pan-pipes hanging on the wall. By these signs he knew me for an evil spirit and had me thrown into a dungeon where I should have eaten the bread of suffering and drunk the waters of bitterness, had I not promptly made my escape by the window and sought refuge in the wooded groves among the Nymphs and the Fauns.\r\n\r\n\"Far and wide the lighted pyres cast the odour of charred flesh. Everywhere there were tortures, executions, broken bones, and tongues cut out. Never before had the spirit of Iahveh breathed forth such atrocious fury. However, it was not altogether in vain that men had raised the lid of the ancient sarcophagus and gazed upon the Roman Virgin.\r\n\r\n\"During this time of great terror when Papists and Reformers rivalled one another in violence and cruelty, amidst all these scenes of torture, the mind of man was regaining strength and courage. It dared to look up to the heavens, and there it saw, not the old Jew drunk with vengeance, but Venus Urania, tranquil and resplendent. Then a new order of things was born, then the great centuries came into being. Without publicly denying the god of their ancestors, men of intellect submitted to his mortal enemies, Science and Reason, and Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Gassendi relegated him gently to the far-distant abyss of first causes. The kindly demons who teach and console unhappy mortals, inspired the great minds of those days with discourses of all kinds, with comedies and tales told in the most polished fashion. Women invented conversation, the art of intimate letter-writing, and politeness. Manners took on a sweetness and a nobility unknown to preceding ages. One of the finest minds of that age of reason, the amiable Bernier, wrote one day to St. Evremond: 'It is a great sin to deprive oneself of a pleasure.' And this pronouncement alone should suffice to show the progress of intelligence in Europe. Not that there had not always been Epicureans but, unlike Bernier, Chapelle, and Moli\\xc3\\xa8re, they had not the consciousness of their talent.\r\n\r\n\"Then even the very devotees understood Nature. And Racine, fierce bigot that he was, knew as well as such an atheistical physician as Guy Patin, how to attribute to divers states of the organs the passions which agitate mankind.\r\n\r\n\"Even in my abbey, whither I had returned after the turmoil, and which sheltered only the ignorant and the shallow thinker, a young monk, less of a dunce than the rest, confided to me that the Holy Spirit expresses itself in bad Greek to humiliate the learned.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, theology and controversy were still raging in this society of thinkers. Not far from Paris in a shady valley there were to be seen solitary beings known as 'les Messieurs,' who called themselves disciples of St. Augustine, and argued with honest conviction that the God of the Scriptures strikes those who fear Him, spares those who confront Him, holds works of no account, and damns--should He so wish it--His most faithful servant; for His justice is not our justice, and His ways are incomprehensible.\r\n\r\n\"One evening I met one of these gentlemen in his garden, where he was pacing thoughtfully among the cabbage-plots and lettuce-beds. I bowed my horned head before him and murmured these friendly words: 'May old Jehovah protect you, sir. You know him well. Oh, how well you know him, and how perfectly you have understood his character.' The holy man thought he discerned in me a messenger from Hell, concluded he was eternally damned, and died suddenly of fright.\r\n\r\n\"The following century was the century of philosophy. The spirit of research was developed, reverence was lost; the pride of the flesh was diminished and the mind acquired fresh energy. Manners took on an elegance until then unknown. On the other hand, the monks of my order grew more and more ignorant and dirty, and the monastery no longer offered me any advantage now that good manners reigned in the town. I could bear it no longer. Flinging my habit to the nettles, I put a powdered wig on my horned brow, hid my goat's legs under white stockings, and cane in hand, my pockets stuffed with gazettes, I frequented the fashionable world, visited the modish promenades, and showed myself assiduously in the _caf\\xc3\\xa9s_ where men of letters were to be found. I was made welcome in _salons_ where, as a happy novelty, there were arm-chairs that fitted the form, and where both men and women engaged in rational conversation.\r\n\r\n\"The very metaphysicians spoke intelligibly. I acquired great weight in the town as an authority on matters of exegesis, and, without boasting, I was largely responsible for the Testament of the cur\\xc3\\xa9 Meslier and _The Bible Explained_, brought out by the chaplains to the King of Prussia.\r\n\r\n\"At this time a comic and cruel misadventure befel the ancient Iahveh. An American Quaker, by means of a kite, stole his thunderbolts.\r\n\r\n\"I was living in Paris, and was at the supper where they talked of strangling the last of the priests with the entrails of the last of the kings. France was in a ferment; a terrible revolution broke out. The ephemeral leaders of the disordered State carried on a Reign of Terror amidst unheard-of perils. They were, for the most part, less pitiless and less cruel than the princes and judges instituted by Iahveh in the kingdoms of the earth; nevertheless, they appeared more ferocious, because they gave judgment in the name of Humanity. Unhappily they were easily moved to pity and of great sensibility. Now men of sensibility are irritable and subject to fits of fury. They were virtuous; they had moral laws, that is to say they conceived certain narrowly defined moral obligations, and judged human actions not by their natural consequences but by abstract principles. Of all the vices which contribute to the undoing of a statesman, virtue is the most fatal; it leads to murder. To work effectively for the happiness of mankind, a man must be superior to all morals, like the divine Julius. God, so ill-used for some time past, did not, on the whole, suffer excessively harsh treatment from these new men. He found protectors among them, and was adored under the name of the Supreme Being. One might even go so far as to say that terror created a diversion from philosophy and was profitable to the old demiurge, in that he appeared to represent order, public tranquillity, and the security of person and property.\r\n\r\n\"While Liberty was coming to birth amid the storm, I lived at Auteuil, and visited Madame Helvetius, where freethinkers in every branch of intellectual activity were to be met with. Nothing could be rarer than a freethinker, even after Voltaire's day. A man who will face death without trembling dare not say anything out of the ordinary about morals. That very same respect for Humanity which prompts him to go forth to his death, makes him bow to public opinion. In those days I enjoyed listening to the talk of Volney, Cabanis, and Tracy. Disciples of the great Condillac, they regarded the senses as the origin of all our knowledge. They called themselves ideologists, were the most honourable people in the world, and grieved the vulgar minds by refusing them immortality. For the majority of people, though they do not know what to do with this life, long for another that shall have no end. During the turmoil, our small philosophical society was sometimes disturbed in the peaceful shades of Auteuil by patrols of patriots. Condorcet, our great man, was an outlaw. I myself was regarded as suspect by the friends of the people, who, in spite of my rustic appearance and my frieze coat, believed me to be an aristocrat, and I confess that independence of thought is the proudest of all aristocracies.\r\n\r\n\"One evening while I was stealthily watching the dryads of Boulogne, who gleamed amid the leaves like the moon rising above the horizon, I was arrested as a suspect, and put in prison. It was a pure misunderstanding; but the Jacobins of those days, like the monks whose place they had usurped, laid great stress on unity of obedience. After the death of Madame Helvetius our society gathered together in the _salon_ of Madame de Condorcet. Bonaparte did not disdain to chat with us sometimes.\r\n\r\n\"Recognizing him to be a great man, we thought him an ideologist like ourselves. Our influence in the land was considerable. We used it in his favour, and urged him towards the Imperial throne, thinking to display to the world a second Marcus Aurelius. We counted on him to establish universal peace; he did not fulfil our expectations, and we were wrong-headed enough to be wroth with him for our own mistake.\r\n\r\n\"Without any doubt he greatly surpassed all other men in quickness of intelligence, depth of dissimulation, and capacity for action. What made him an accomplished ruler was that he lived entirely in the present moment, and had no thoughts for anything beyond the immediate and actual reality. His genius was far-reaching and agile; his intelligence, vast in extent but common and vulgar in character, embraced humanity, but did not rise above it. He thought what every grenadier in the army thought; but he thought it with unprecedented force. He loved the game of chance, and it pleased him to tempt fortune by urging pigmies in their hundreds and thousands against each other. It was the game of a child as big as the world. He was too wily not to introduce old Iahveh into the game,--Iahveh, who was still powerful on earth, and who resembled him in his spirit of violence and domination. He threatened him, flattered him, caressed him, and intimidated him. He imprisoned his Vicar, of whom he demanded, with the knife at his throat, that rite of unction which, since the days of Saul of old, has bestowed might upon kings; he restored the worship of the demiurge, sang _Te Deums_ to him, and made himself known through him as God of the earth, in small catechisms scattered broadcast throughout the Empire. They united their thunders, and a fine uproar they made.\r\n\r\n\"While Napoleon's amusements were throwing Europe into a turmoil, we congratulated ourselves on our wisdom, a little sad, withal, at seeing the era of philosophy ushered in with massacre, torture, and war. The worst is that the children of the century, fallen into the most distressing disorder, formed the conception of a literary and picturesque Christianity, which betokens a degeneracy of mind really unbelievable, and finally fell into Romanticism. War and Romanticism, what terrible scourges! And how pitiful to see these same people nursing a childish and savage love for muskets and drums! They did not understand that war, which trained the courage and founded the cities of barbarous and ignorant men, brings to the victor himself but ruin and misery, and is nothing but a horrible and stupid crime when nations are united together by common bonds of art, science, and trade.\r\n\r\n\"Insane Europeans who plot to cut each others' throats, now that one and the same civilisation enfolds and unites them all!\r\n\r\n\"I renounced all converse with these madmen and withdrew to this village, where I devoted myself to gardening. The peaches in my orchard remind me of the sun-kissed skin of the M\\xc3\\xa6nads. For mankind I have retained my old friendship, a little admiration, and much pity, and I await, while cultivating this enclosure, that still distant day when the great Dionysus shall come, followed by his Fauns and his Bacchantes, to restore beauty and gladness to the world, and bring back the Golden Age. I shall fare joyously behind his car. And who knows if in that day of triumph mankind will be there for us to see? Who knows whether their worn-out race will not have already fulfilled its destiny, and whether other beings will not rise upon the ashes and ruins of what once was man and his genius? Who knows if winged beings will not have taken possession of the terrestrial empire? Even then the work of the good demons will not be ended,--they will teach a winged race arts and the joy of life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n     WHEREIN WE ARE SHOWN THE INTERIOR OF A BRIC-A-BRAC SHOP, AND      SEE HOW P\\xc3\\x88RE GUINARDON'S GUILTY HAPPINESS IS MARRED BY THE      JEALOUSY OF A LOVE-LORN DAME\r\n\r\n\r\nP\\xc3\\xa8re Guinardon (as Z\\xc3\\xa9phyrine had faithfully reported to Monsieur Sariette) smuggled out the pictures, furniture, and curios stored in his attic in the rue Princesse--his studio he called it--and used them to stock a shop he had taken in the rue de Courcelles. Thither he went to take up his abode, leaving Z\\xc3\\xa9phyrine, with whom he had lived for fifty years, without a bed or a saucepan or a penny to call her own, except eighteenpence the poor creature had in her purse. P\\xc3\\xa8re Guinardon opened an old picture and curiosity shop, and in it he installed the fair Octavie.\r\n\r\nThe shop-front presented an attractive appearance: there were Flemish angels in green copes, after the manner of G\\xc3\\xa9rard David, a Salom\\xc3\\xa9 of the Luini school, a Saint Barbara in painted wood of French workmanship, Limoges enamel-work, Bohemian and Venetian glass, dishes from Urbino. There were specimens of English point-lace which, if her tale was true, had been presented to Z\\xc3\\xa9phyrine, in the days of her radiant girlhood, by the Emperor Napoleon III. Within, there were golden articles that glinted in the shadows, while pictures of Christ, the Apostles, high-bred dames, and nymphs also presented themselves to the gaze. There was one canvas that was turned face to the wall so that it should only be looked at by connoisseurs; and connoisseurs are scarce. It was a replica of Fragonard's _Gimblette_, a brilliant painting that looked as if it had barely had time to dry. Papa Guinardon himself remarked on the fact. At the far end of the shop was a king-wood cabinet, the drawers of which were full of all manner of treasures: water-colours by Baudouin, eighteenth-century books of illustrations, miniatures, and so forth.\r\n\r\nBut the real masterpiece, the marvel, the gem, the pearl of great price, stood upon an easel veiled from public view. It was a _Coronation of the Virgin_ by Fra Angelico, an exquisitely delicate thing in gold and blue and pink. P\\xc3\\xa8re Guinardon was asking a hundred thousand francs for it. Upon a Louis XV chair beside an Empire work-table on which stood a vase of flowers, sat the fair Octavie, broidery in hand. She, having left her glistering rags behind her in the garret in the rue Princesse, no longer presented the appearance of a touched-up Rembrandt, but shone, rather, with the soft radiance and limpidity of a Vermeer of Delft, for the delectation of the connoisseurs who frequented the shop of Papa Guinardon. Tranquil and demure, she remained alone in the shop all day, while the old fellow himself was up aloft working away at the deuce knows what picture. About five o'clock he used to come downstairs and have a chat with the habitu\\xc3\\xa9s of the establishment.\r\n\r\nThe most regular caller was the Comte Desmaisons, a thin, cadaverous man. A strand of hair issued from the deep hollow under each cheek-bone, and, broadening as it descended, shed upon his chin and chest torrents of snow in which he was for ever trailing his long, fleshless, gold-ringed fingers. For twenty years he had been mourning the loss of his wife, who had been carried off by consumption in the flower of her youth and beauty. Since then he had spent his whole life in endeavouring to hold converse with the dead and in filling his lonely mansion with second-rate paintings. His confidence in Guinardon knew no bounds. Another client who was a scarcely less frequent visitor to the shop was Monsieur Blancmesnil, a director of a large financial establishment. He was a florid, prosperous-looking man of fifty. He took no great interest in matters of art, and was perhaps an indifferent connoisseur, but, in his case, it was the fair Octavie, seated in the middle of the shop, like a song-bird in its cage, that offered the attraction.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Blancmesnil soon established relations with her, a fact which P\\xc3\\xa8re Guinardon alone failed to perceive, for the old fellow was still young in his love-affair with Octavie. Monsieur Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan d'Esparvieu used to pay occasional visits to P\\xc3\\xa8re Guinardon's shop out of mere curiosity, for he strongly suspected the old man of being a first-rate \"faker.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then that doughty swordsman, Monsieur Le Truc de Ruffec, also came to see the old antiquary on one occasion, and acquainted him with a plan he had on foot. Monsieur Le Truc de Ruffec was getting up a little historical exhibition of small arms at the Petit Palais in aid of the fund for the education of the native children in Morocco and wanted P\\xc3\\xa8re Guinardon to lend him a few of the most valuable articles in his collection.\r\n\r\n\"Our first idea,\" he said, \"was to organise an exhibition to be called 'The Cross and the Sword.' The juxtaposition of the two words will make the idea which has prompted our undertaking sufficiently clear to you. It was an idea pre-eminently patriotic and Christian which led us to associate the Sword, which is the symbol of Honour, with the Cross, which is the symbol of Salvation. It was hoped that our work would be graced by the distinguished patronage of the Minister of War and Monseigneur Cachepot. Unfortunately there were difficulties in the way, and the full realisation of the project had to be deferred. In the meantime we are limiting our exhibition to 'The Sword.' I have drawn up an explanatory note indicating the significance of the demonstration.\"\r\n\r\nHaving delivered himself of these remarks, Monsieur Le Truc de Ruffec produced a pocket-case stuffed full of papers. Picking out from a medley of judgment summonses and other odds and ends a little piece of very crumpled paper, he exclaimed, \"Ah, here it is,\" and proceeded to read as follows: \"'The Sword is a fierce Virgin; it is _par excellence_ the Frenchman's weapon. And now, when patriotic sentiment, after suffering an all too protracted eclipse, is beginning to shine forth again more ardently than ever ...' and so forth; you see?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he repeated his request for some really fine specimen to be placed in the most conspicuous position in the exhibition to be held on behalf of the little native children of Morocco, of which General d'Esparvieu was to be honorary President.\r\n\r\nArms and armour were by no means P\\xc3\\xa8re Guinardon's strong point. He dealt principally in pictures, drawings, and books. But he was never to be taken unawares. He took down a rapier with a gilt colander-shaped hilt, a highly typical piece of workmanship of the Louis XIII-Napoleon III period, and presented it to the exhibition promoter, who, while contemplating it with respect, maintained a diplomatic silence.\r\n\r\n\"I have something better still in here,\" said the antiquary, and he produced from his inner shop--where it had been lying among the walking-sticks and umbrellas--a real demon of a sword, adorned with fleurs-de-lys, a genuine royal relic. It was the sword of Philippe-Auguste as worn by an actor at the _Od\\xc3\\xa9on_ when _Agn\\xc3\\xa8s de M\\xc3\\xa9ranie_ was being performed in 1846. Guinardon held it point downwards, as though it were a cross, clasping his hands piously on the cross-bar. He looked as loyal as the sword itself.\r\n\r\n\"Have her for your exhibition,\" said he. \"The damsel is well worth it. Bouvines is her name.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I find a buyer for it,\" said Monsieur Le True de Ruffec, twirling his enormous moustachios, \"I suppose you will allow me a little commission?\"\r\n\r\nSome days later, P\\xc3\\xa8re Guinardon was mysteriously displaying a picture to the Comte Desmaisons and Monsieur Blancmesnil. It was a newly discovered work of El Greco, an amazingly fine example of the Master's later style. It represented a Saint Francis of Assisi standing erect upon Mont Alverno. He was mounting heavenward like a column of smoke, and was plunging into the regions of the clouds a monstrously narrow head that the distance rendered smaller still. In fine it was a real, very real, nay, too real El Greco. The two collectors were attentively scrutinizing the work, while P\\xc3\\xa8re Guinardon was belauding the depth of the shadows and the sublimity of the expression. He was raising his arms aloft to convey an idea of the greatness of Theotocopuli, who derived from Tintoretto, whom, however, he surpassed in loftiness by a hundred cubits.\r\n\r\n\"He was chaste and pure and strong; a mystic, a visionary.\"\r\n\r\nComte Desmaisons declared that El Greco was his favourite painter. In his inmost heart Blancmesnil was not so entirely struck with it.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and Monsieur Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan quite unexpectedly appeared on the scene.\r\n\r\nHe gave a glance at the Saint Francis, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Bless my soul!\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur Blancmesnil, anxious to improve his knowledge, asked him what he thought of this artist who was now so much in vogue. Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan replied, glibly enough, that he did not regard El Greco as the eccentric, the madman that people used to take him for. It was rather his opinion that a defect of vision from which Theotocopuli suffered compelled him to deform his figures.\r\n\r\n\"Being afflicted with astigmatism and strabismus,\" Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan went on, \"he painted the things he saw exactly as he used to see them.\"\r\n\r\nComte Desmaisons was not readily disposed to accept so natural an explanation, which, however, by its very simplicity, highly commended itself to Monsieur Blancmesnil.\r\n\r\nP\\xc3\\xa8re Guinardon, quite beside himself, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to tell me, Monsieur d'Esparvieu, that Saint John was astigmatic because he beheld a woman clothed with the sun, crowned with stars, with the moon about her feet; the Beast with seven heads and ten horns, and the seven angels robed in white linen that bore the seven cups filled with the wrath of the Living God?\"\r\n\r\n\"After all,\" said Monsieur Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan, by way of conclusion, \"people are right in admiring El Greco if he had genius enough to impose his morbidity of vision upon them. By the same token, the contortions to which he subjects the human countenance may give satisfaction to those who love suffering,--a class more numerous than is generally supposed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur,\" replied the Comte Desmaisons, stroking his luxuriant beard with his long, thin hand, \"we must love those that love us. Suffering loves us and attaches itself to us. We must love it if life is to be supportable to us. In the knowledge of this truth lies the strength and value of Christianity. Alas! I do not possess the gift of Faith. It is that which drives me to despair.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man thought of her for whom he had been mourning twenty years, and forthwith his reason left him, and his thoughts abandoned themselves unresistingly to the morbid imaginings of gentle and melancholy madness.\r\n\r\nHaving, he said, made a study of psychic matters, and having, with the co-operation of a favourable medium, carried out experiments concerning the nature and duration of the soul, he had obtained some remarkable results, which, however, did not afford him complete satisfaction. He had succeeded in viewing the soul of his dead wife under the appearance of a transparent and gelatinous mass which bore not the slightest resemblance to his adored one. The most painful part about the whole experiment--which he had repeated over and over again--was that the gelatinous mass, which was furnished with a number of extremely slender tentacles, maintained them in constant motion in time to a rhythm apparently intended to make certain signs, but of what these movements were supposed to convey there was not the slightest clue.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of this narrative Monsieur Blancmesnil had been whispering in a corner with the youthful Octavie, who sat mute and still, with her eyes on the ground.\r\n\r\nNow Z\\xc3\\xa9phyrine had by no means made up her mind to resign her lover into the hands of an unworthy rival. She would often go round of a morning, with her shopping-basket on her arm, and prowl about outside the curio shop. Torn betwixt grief and rage, tormented by warring ideas, she sometimes thought she would empty a saucepanful of vitriol on the head of the faithless one; at others that she would fling herself at his feet, and shower tears and kisses on his precious hands. One day, as she was thus eyeing her Michel--her beloved but guilty Michel--she noticed through the window the fair and youthful Octavie, who was sitting with her embroidery at a table upon which, in a vase of crystal, a rose was swooning to death. Z\\xc3\\xa9phyrine, in a transport of fury, brought down her umbrella on her rival's fair head, and called her a bitch and a trollop. Octavie fled in terror, and ran for the police, while Z\\xc3\\xa9phyrine, beside herself with grief and love, kept digging away with her old gamp at the _Gimblette_ of Fragonard, the fuliginous Saint Francis of El Greco, the virgins, the nymphs, and the apostles, and knocked the gilt off the Fra Angelico, shrieking all the while:\r\n\r\n\"All those pictures there, the El Greco, the Beato Angelico, the Fragonard, the G\\xc3\\xa9rard David, and the Baudouins--Guinardon painted the whole lot of them himself, the wretch, the scoundrel! That Fra Angelico there, why I saw him painting it on my ironing-board, and that G\\xc3\\xa9rard David he executed on an old midwife's sign-board. You and that bitch of yours, why, I'll do for the pair of you just as I'm doing for these pictures.\"\r\n\r\nAnd tugging away at the coat of an aged collector who, trembling all over, had hidden himself in the darkest corner of the shop, she called him to witness to the crimes of Guinardon, perjurer and impostor. The police had simply to tear her out of the ruined shop. As she was being taken off to the station, followed by a great crowd of people, she raised her fiery eyes to Heaven, crying in a voice choked with sobs:\r\n\r\n\"But don't you know Michel? If you knew him, you would understand that it is impossible to live without him. Michel! He is handsome and good and charming. He is a very god. He is Love itself. I love him! I love him! I love him! I have known men high up in the world--Dukes, Ministers of State, and higher still. Not one of them was worthy to clean the mud off Michel's boots. My good, kind sirs, give him back to me again.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n     WHEREIN WE ARE PERMITTED TO OBSERVE THE ADMIRABLE CHARACTER      OF BOUCHOTTE, WHO RESISTS VIOLENCE BUT YIELDS TO LOVE. AFTER      THAT LET NO ONE CALL THE AUTHOR A MISOGYNIST\r\n\r\n\r\nOn coming away from the Baron Everdingen's, Prince Istar went to have a few oysters and a bottle of white wine at an eating-house in the Market. Then, being prudent as well as powerful, he paid a visit to his friend, Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile Belais, for his pockets were full of bombs, and he wanted to secrete them in the musician's cupboard. The composer of _Aline, Queen of Golconda_ was not at home. However, the Ker\\xc3\\xbbb found Bouchotte busily working up the r\\xc3\\xb4le of Zigouille; for the young artiste was booked to play the principal part in _Les Apaches_, an operetta that was then being rehearsed in one of the big music halls. The part in question was that of a street-walker who by her obscene gestures lures a passer-by into a trap, and then, while her victim is being gagged and bound, repeats with fiendish cruelty the lascivious motions by which he had been led astray. The part required that she should appear both as mime and singer, and she was in a state of high enthusiasm about it.\r\n\r\nThe accompanist had just left. Prince Istar seated himself at the piano, and Bouchotte resumed her task. Her movements were unseemly and delicious. Her tawny hair was flying in all directions in wild disordered curls; her skin was moist, it exhaled a scent of violets and alkaline salts which made the nostrils throb; even she herself felt the intoxication. Suddenly, inebriated with her intoxicating presence, Prince Istar arose, and with never a word or a look, caught her into his arms and drew her on to the couch, the little couch with the flowered tapestry which Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile had procured at one of the big shops by promising to pay ten francs a month for a long term of years. Now Istar might have solicited Bouchotte's favours; he might have invited her to a rapid, and, withal, a mutual embrace, and, despite her preoccupation and excitement, she would not have refused him. But Bouchotte was a girl of spirit. The merest hint of coercion awoke all her untamable pride. She would consent of her own accord, yes; but be mastered, never! She would readily yield to love, curiosity, pity, to less than that even, but she would die rather than yield to force. Her surprise immediately gave place to fury. She fought her aggressor with all her heart and soul.\r\n\r\nWith nails, to which fury lent an added edge, she tore at the cheeks and eyelids of the Ker\\xc3\\xbbb, and, though he held her as in a vice, she arched herself so stiffly and made such excellent play with knee and elbow, that the human-headed bull, blinded with blood and rage, was sent crashing into the piano which gave forth a prolonged groan, while the bombs, tumbling out of his pockets, fell on the floor with a noise like thunder. And Bouchotte, with dishevelled locks, and one breast bare, beautiful and terrible, stood brandishing the poker over the prostrate giant, crying:\r\n\r\n\"Be off with you, or I'll put your eyes out!\"\r\n\r\nPrince Istar went to wash himself in the kitchen, and plunged his gory visage into a basin where some haricot beans lay soaking; then he withdrew without anger or resentment, for he had a noble soul.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he gone when the door-bell rang. Bouchotte, calling upon the absent maid in vain, slipped on a dressing-gown and opened the door herself. A young man, very correct in appearance and rather good-looking, bowed politely, and apologising for having to introduce himself, gave his name. It was Maurice d'Esparvieu.\r\n\r\nMaurice was still seeking his guardian angel. Upheld by a desperate hope, he sought him in the queerest places. He enquired for him at the houses of sorcerers, magicians, and thaumaturgists, who in filthy hovels lay bare the ineffable secrets of the future, and who, though masters of all the treasures of the earth, wear trousers without any seats to them, and eat pigs' brains. That very day, having been to a back street in Montmartre to consult a priest of Satan, who practised black magic by piercing waxen images, Maurice had gone on to Bouchotte's, having been sent by Madame de la Verdeli\\xc3\\xa8re, who, being about to give a f\\xc3\\xaate in aid of the fund for the Preservation of Country Churches, was anxious to secure Bouchotte's services, since she had suddenly become--no one knew why--a fashionable artiste.\r\n\r\nBouchotte invited the visitor to sit down on the little flowered couch; at his request she seated herself beside him, and our young man of fashion explained to the singer what Madame de la Verdeli\\xc3\\xa8re desired of her. The lady wished Bouchotte to sing one of those _apache_ songs which were giving such delight in the fashionable world. Unfortunately Madame de la Verdeli\\xc3\\xa8re could only offer a very modest fee, one out of all proportion to the merits of the artiste, but then it was for a good cause.\r\n\r\nBouchotte agreed to take part, and accepted the reduced fee with the accustomed liberality of the poor towards the rich and of artists towards society people. Bouchotte was not a selfish girl; the work for the preservation of country churches interested her. She remembered with sobs and tears her first communion, and she still retained her faith. When she passed by a church she wanted to enter it, especially in the evening. And so she did not love the Republic which had done its utmost to destroy both the Church and the Army. Her heart rejoiced to see the re-birth of national sentiment. France was lifting up her head. What was most applauded in the music halls were songs about the soldiers and the kind nuns. Meanwhile Maurice inhaled the odour of her tawny hair, the subtle bitter perfume of her body, all the odours of her person, and desire grew in him. He felt her near him on the little couch, very warm and very soft. He complimented the artiste on her great talent. She asked him what he liked best in all her repertory. He knew nothing about it, still he made replies that satisfied her. She had dictated them herself without knowing it. The vain creature spoke of her talent, of her success, as she wished others to speak of them. She never ceased talking of her triumphs, yet withal she was candour itself. Maurice in all sincerity praised Bouchotte's beauty, her fresh skin, her purity of line. She attributed this advantage to the fact that she never made up and never \"put messes on her face.\" As to her figure, she admitted that there was enough everywhere and none too much, and to illustrate this assertion she passed her hand over all the contours of her charming body, rising lightly to follow the delightful curves on which she reposed.\r\n\r\nMaurice was quite moved by it. It began to grow dark; she offered to light up. He begged her to do nothing of the sort.\r\n\r\nTheir talk, at first gay and full of laughter, grew more intimate and very sweet, with a certain languor in its tone. It seemed to Bouchotte that she had known Monsieur Maurice d'Esparvieu for a long time, and holding him for a man of delicacy, she gave him her confidence. She told him that she was by nature a good woman, but that she had had a grasping and unscrupulous mother. Maurice recalled her to the consideration of her own beauty, and exalted by subtle flattery the excellent opinion she had of herself. Patient and calculating, in spite of the burning desire growing in him, he aroused and increased in the desired one the longing to be still further admired. The dressing-gown opened and slipped down of its own accord, the living satin of her shoulders gleamed in the mysterious light of evening. He--so prudent, so clever, so adroit,--let her sink in his arms, ardent and half swooning before she had even perceived she had granted anything at all. Their breath and their murmurs intermingled. And the little flowery couch sighed in sympathy with them.\r\n\r\nWhen they recovered the power to express their feelings in words, she whispered in his ear that his cheek was even softer than her own.\r\n\r\nHe answered, holding her embraced:\r\n\r\n\"It is charming to hold you like this. One would think you had no bones.\"\r\n\r\nShe replied, closing her eyes:\r\n\r\n\"It is because I love you. Love seems to dissolve my bones; it makes me as soft and melting as a pig's foot _\\xc3\\xa0 la Ste. Menebould_.\"\r\n\r\nHereupon Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile came in, and Bouchotte called upon him to thank Monsieur Maurice d'Esparvieu, who had been amiable enough to be the bearer of a handsome offer from Madame la Comtesse de la Verdeli\\xc3\\xa8re.\r\n\r\nThe musician was happy, feeling the quiet and peace of the house after a day of fruitless applications, of colourless lessons, of failure and humiliation. Three new collaborators had been thrust upon him who would add their signatures to his on his operetta, and receive their share of the author's rights, and he had been told to introduce the tango into the Court of Golconda. He pressed young d'Esparvieu's hand and dropped wearily on to the little couch, which, being now at the end of its strength, gave way at the four legs and suddenly collapsed.\r\n\r\nAnd the angel, precipitated to the ground, rolled terror-struck on to the watch, match-box and cigarette-case that had fallen from Maurice's pocket, and on to the bombs Prince Istar had left behind him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n     CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE VICISSITUDES THAT BEFEL THE      \"LUCRETIUS\" OF THE PRIOR DE VEND\\xc3\\x94ME\r\n\r\n\r\nL\\xc3\\xa9ger-Massieu, successor to L\\xc3\\xa9ger senior, the binder, whose establishment was in the rue de l'Abbaye, opposite the old H\\xc3\\xb4tel of the Abb\\xc3\\xa9s of Saint Germain-des-Pr\\xc3\\xa8s, in the hotbed of ancient schools and learned societies, employed an excellent but by no means numerous staff of workmen, and served with leisurely deliberation a client\\xc3\\xa8le who had learned to practise the virtue of patience. Six weeks had elapsed since he had received the parcel of books that had been despatched by Monsieur Sariette, but still L\\xc3\\xa9ger-Massieu had not yet put the work in hand. It was not until fifty-three days had come and gone, that, after calling over the books against the list that had been drawn up by Monsieur Sariette, the binder gave them out to his workmen. The little _Lucretius_ with the Prior de Vend\\xc3\\xb4me's arms not being mentioned on the list, it was assumed that it had been sent by another customer.\r\n\r\nAnd as it did not figure on any list of goods received it remained shut up in a cupboard, from which L\\xc3\\xa9ger-Massieu's son, the youthful Ernest, one day surreptitiously abstracted it, and slipped it into his pocket. Ernest was in love with a neighbouring seamstress whose name was Rose. Rose was fond of the country, and liked to hear the birds singing in the woods, and in order to procure the wherewithal to take her to Chatou one Sunday and give her a dinner, Ernest parted with the _Lucretius_ for ten francs to old Moranger, a second-hand dealer in the rue Saint X----, who displayed no great curiosity regarding the origin of his acquisitions. Old Moranger handed over the volume, the very same day, to Monsieur Poussard, an expert in books, of the faubourg Saint Germain, for sixty francs. The latter removed the stamp which disclosed the ownership of the matchless copy, and sold it for five hundred francs to Monsieur Joseph Meyer, the well-known collector, who handed it straight away for three thousand francs to Monsieur Ardon, the bookseller, who immediately transferred it to Monsieur R----, the great Parisian bibliopolist, who gave six thousand for it, and sold it again a fortnight later at a handsome profit to Madame la Comtesse de Gorce. Well known in the higher ranks of Parisian society, the lady in question is what was called in the seventeenth century a \"curieuse,\" that is to say, a lover of pictures, books, and china. In her mansion in the Avenue d'J\\xc3\\xa9na she possesses collections of works of art which bear witness to the diversity of her knowledge and the excellence of her taste. During the month of July, while the Comtesse de Gorce was away at her ch\\xc3\\xa2teau at Sarville in Normandy, the house in the Avenue d'J\\xc3\\xa9na, being unoccupied, was visited one night by a thief said to belong to a gang known as \"The Collectors,\" who made works of art the special objects of their raids.\r\n\r\nThe police enquiry elicited the fact that the marauder had reached the first floor by means of the waste-pipe, that he had then climbed over the balcony, forced a shutter with a jemmy, broken a pane of glass, turned the window-fastener, and made his way into the long gallery. There he broke open several cupboards and possessed himself of whatever took his fancy. His booty consisted for the most part of small but valuable articles, such as gold caskets, a few ivory carvings of the fourteenth century, two splendid fifteenth-century manuscripts, and a volume which the Countess's secretary briefly described as \"a morocco-bound book with a coat of arms on it,\" and which was none other than the _Lucretius_ from the d'Esparvieu library.\r\n\r\nThe malefactor, who was supposed to be an English cook, was never discovered. But, two months or so after the theft, a well-dressed, clean-shaven young man passed down the rue de Courcelles, in the dimness of twilight, and went to offer the Prior de Vend\\xc3\\xb4me's _Lucretius_ to P\\xc3\\xa8re Guinardon. The antiquary gave him four shillings for it, examined it carefully, recognised its interest and its beauty, and put it in the king-wood cabinet, where he kept his special treasures.\r\n\r\nSuch were the vicissitudes which, in the course of a single season, befel this thing of beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n     WHEREIN MAURICE FINDS HIS ANGEL AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe performance was over. Bouchotte in her dressing-room was taking off her make-up, when the door opened softly and old Monsieur Sandraque, her protector, came in, followed by a troop of her other admirers. Without so much as turning her head, she asked them what they meant by coming and staring at her like a pack of imbeciles, and whether they thought they were in a tent at the Neuilly Fair, looking at the freak woman.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then, ladies and gentlemen,\" she rattled on derisively, \"just put a penny in the box for the young lady's marriage-portion, and she'll let you feel her legs,--all made of marble!\"\r\n\r\nThen, with an angry glance at the admiring throng, she exclaimed: \"Come, off you go! Look alive!\"\r\n\r\nShe sent them all packing, her sweetheart Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile among them,--the pale-faced, long-haired, gentle, melancholy, short-sighted, and dreamy Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile.\r\n\r\nBut recognizing her little Maurice, she gave him a smile. He approached her, and leaning over the back of the chair on which she was seated, congratulated her on her playing and singing, duly performing a kiss at the end of every compliment. She did not let him escape thus, and with reiterated enquiries, pressing solicitations, feigned incredulity, obliged him to repeat his stock panegyrics three or four times over, and when he stopped she seemed so disappointed that he was forced to take up the strain again immediately. He found it trying, for he was no connoisseur, but he had the pleasure of kissing her plump curved shoulders all golden in the light, and of catching glimpses of her pretty face in the mirror over the toilet-table.\r\n\r\n\"You were delicious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really?... you think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Adorable ... div----\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly he gave a loud cry. His eyes had seen in the mirror a face appear at the back of the dressing-room. He turned swiftly round, flung his arms about Arcade, and drew him into the corridor.\r\n\r\n\"What manners!\" exclaimed Bouchotte, gasping.\r\n\r\nBut, pushing his way through a troop of performing dogs, and a family of American acrobats, young d'Esparvieu dragged his angel towards the exit.\r\n\r\nHe hurried him forth into the cool darkness of the boulevard, delirious with joy and wondering whether it was all too good to be true.\r\n\r\n\"Here you are!\" he cried; \"here you are! I have been looking for you a long time, Arcade,--or Mirar if you like,--and I have found you at last. Arcade, you have taken my guardian angel from me. Give him back to me. Arcade, do you love me still?\"\r\n\r\nArcade replied that in accomplishing the super-angelic task he had set himself he had been forced to crush under foot friendship, pity, love, and all those feelings which tend to soften the soul; but that, on the other hand, his new state, by exposing him to suffering and privation, disposed him to love Humanity, and that he felt a certain mechanical friendship for his poor Maurice.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" exclaimed Maurice, \"if only you love me, come back to me, stay with me. I cannot do without you. While I had you with me I was not aware of your presence. But no sooner did you depart than I felt a horrible blank. Without you I am like a body without a soul. Do you know that in the little flat in the rue de Rome, with Gilberte by my side, I feel lonely, I miss you sorely, and long to see you and to hear you as I did that day when you made me so angry. Confess I was right, and that your behaviour on that occasion was not that of a gentleman. That you, you of so high an origin, so noble a mind, could commit such an indiscretion is extraordinary, when one comes to think about it. Madame des Aubels has not yet forgiven you. She blames you for having frightened her by appearing at such an inconvenient moment, and for being insolent and forward while hooking her dress and tying her shoes. I, I have forgotten everything. I only remember that you are my celestial brother, the saintly companion of my childhood. No, Arcade, you must not, you cannot leave me. You are my angel; you are my property.\"\r\n\r\nArcade explained to young d'Esparvieu that he could no longer be guiding angel to a Christian, having himself gone down into the pit. And he painted a horrible picture of himself; he described himself as breathing hatred and fury; in fact, an infernal spirit.\r\n\r\n\"All nonsense!\" said Maurice, smiling, his eyes big with tears.\r\n\r\n\"Alas! our ideas, our destiny, everything tends to part us, Maurice. But I cannot stifle the tenderness I feel for you, and your candour forces me to love you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" sighed Maurice. \"You do not love me. You have never loved me. In a brother or a sister such indifference would be natural; in a friend it would be ordinary; in a guardian angel it is monstrous. Arcade, you are an abominable being. I hate you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have loved you dearly, Maurice, and I still love you. You trouble my heart which I deemed encased in triple bronze. You show me my own weakness. When you were a little innocent boy I loved you as tenderly and purely as Miss Kate, your English governess, who caressed you with so much fervour. In the country, when the thin bark of the plane trees peels off in long strips and discloses the tender green trunk, after the rains which make the fine sand run on the sloping paths, I showed you how with that sand, those strips of bark, a few wild flowers, and a spray of maidenhair fern to make rustic bridges, rustic shelters, terraces, and those gardens of Adonis, which last but an hour. During the month of May in Paris we raised an altar to the Virgin, and we burnt incense before it, the scent of which, permeating all the house, reminded Marcelline, the cook, of her village church and her lost innocence, and drew from her floods of tears; it also gave your mother a headache, your mother who, with all her wealth, was crushed with the _ennui_ that is common to the fortunate ones of this world. When you went to college I interested myself in your progress, I shared your work and your play, I pondered with you over arduous problems in arithmetic, I sought the impenetrable meaning of a phrase of Julius C\\xc3\\xa6sar's. What fine games of prisoners' base and football we had together! More than once did we know the intoxication of victory, and our young laurels were not soaked in blood or tears. Maurice, I did all I could to protect your innocence, but I could not prevent your losing it at the age of fourteen. Afterwards I regretfully saw you loving women of all sorts, of divers ages, by no means beautiful, at least in the eyes of an angel. Saddened at the sight, I devoted myself to study; a fine library offered me resources rarely met with. I delved into the history of religions; you know the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"But now, my dear Arcade,\" concluded young d'Esparvieu, \"you have lost your position, your situation, you are entirely without resource. You have lost caste, you are off the lines, a vagabond, a bare-footed wanderer.\"\r\n\r\nThe Angel replied bitterly that, after all, he was a little better clad at present than when he was wearing the slops of a suicide.\r\n\r\nMaurice alleged in excuse that when he dressed his naked angel in a suicide's slops, he was irritated with that angel's infidelity. But it was useless to dwell on the past or to recriminate. What was really needful was to consider what steps to take in future.\r\n\r\nAnd he asked:\r\n\r\n\"Arcade, what do you think of doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have I not already told you, Maurice? To fight with Him who reigns in the heavens, dethrone Him, and set up Satan in His stead.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will not do it. To begin with it is not the opportune moment. Opinion is not with you. You will not be in the swim, as papa says. Conservatism and authority are all the go nowadays. We like to be ruled, and the President of the Republic is going to parley with the Pope. Do not be obstinate, Arcade. You are not as bad as you say. At bottom you are like the rest of the world, you adore the good God.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought I had already explained to you, Maurice, that He whom you consider God is actually but a demiurge. He is absolutely ignorant of the divine world above him, and in all good faith believes himself to be the true and only God. You will find in the _History of the Church_, by Monsignor Duchesne--Vol. I, page 162--that this proud and narrow-minded demiurge is named Ialdabaoth. My child, so as not to ruffle your prejudices and to deal gently with your feelings in future, that is the name I shall give him. If it should happen that I should speak of him to you, I shall call him Ialdabaoth. I must leave you. Adieu.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay----\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall not let you go thus. You have deprived me of my guardian angel. It is for you to repair the injury you have caused me. Give me another one.\"\r\n\r\nArcade objected that it was difficult for him to satisfy such a demand. That having quarrelled with the sovereign dispenser of guardian Spirits, he could obtain nothing from that quarter.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Maurice,\" he added, smiling, \"ask for one yourself from Ialdabaoth.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,--no,--no,\" exclaimed Maurice. \"You have taken away my guardian angel,--give him back to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! I cannot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it, Arcade, because you are a revolutionary that you cannot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"An enemy of God?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"A Satanic spirit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" exclaimed young Maurice, \"I will be your guardian angel,--I will not leave you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Maurice d'Esparvieu took Arcade to have some oysters at P----'s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n     THE CONCLAVE\r\n\r\n\r\nThat day, convoked by Arcade and Zita, the rebellious angels met together on the banks of the Seine at La Jonch\\xc3\\xa8re, in a deserted and tumble-down entertainment-hall that Prince Istar had hired from a pot-house keeper called Barattan. Three hundred angels crowded together in the stalls and boxes. A table, an arm-chair, and a collection of small chairs were arranged on the stage, where hung the tattered remnants of a piece of rustic scenery. The walls, coloured in distemper with flowers and fruit, were cracked and stained with damp, and were crumbling away in flakes. The vulgar and poverty-stricken appearance of the place rendered the grandeur of the passions exhibited therein all the more striking.\r\n\r\nWhen Prince Istar asked the assembly to form its Committee, and first of all to elect a President, the name that was renowned throughout the world entered the minds of all present, but a religious respect sealed their lips; and after a moment's silence, the absent Nectaire was elected by acclamation. Having been invited to take the chair between Zita and an angel of Japan, Arcade immediately began as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Sons of Heaven! My comrades! You have freed yourselves from the bonds of celestial servitude--you have shaken off the thrall of him called Iahveh, but to whom we should here accord his veritable name of Ialdabaoth, for he is not the creator of the worlds, but merely an ignorant and barbarous demiurge, who having obtained possession of a minute portion of the Universe has therein sown suffering and death. Sons of Heaven, tell me, I charge you, whether you will combat and destroy Ialdabaoth?\"\r\n\r\nAll with one voice made answer:\r\n\r\n\"We will!\"\r\n\r\nAnd many speaking all together swore they would scale the mountain of Ialdabaoth, and hurl down the walls of jasper and porphyry, and plunge the tyrant of Heaven into eternal darkness.\r\n\r\nBut a voice of crystal pierced through the sullen murmur.\r\n\r\n\"Tremble, ye impious, sacrilegious madmen! The Lord hath already lifted his dread arm to smite you!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a loyal angel who, with an impulse of faith and love, envying the glory of confessors and martyrs, jealous and eager, like his God himself, to emulate man in the beauty of sacrifice, had flung himself in the midst of the blasphemers, to brave them, to confound them, and to fall beneath their blows. The assembly turned upon him with furious unanimity. Those nearest to him overwhelmed him with blows. He continued to cry, in a clear, ringing voice, \"Glory to God! Glory to God! Glory to God!\"\r\n\r\nA rebel seized him by the neck and strangled his praises of the Almighty in his throat. He was thrown to the ground, trampled underfoot. Prince Istar picked him up, took him by the wings between his fingers, then rising like a column of smoke, opened a ventilator, which no one else could have reached, and passed the faithful angel through it. Order was immediately restored.\r\n\r\n\"Comrades,\" continued Arcade, \"now that we have affirmed our stern resolve, we must examine the possible plans of campaign, and choose the best. You will therefore have to consider if we should attack the enemy in full force, or whether it were better, by a lengthy and assiduous propaganda, to win the inhabitants of Heaven to our cause.\"\r\n\r\n\"War! War!\" shouted the assembled host.\r\n\r\nAnd it seemed as if one could hear the sound of trumpets and the rolling of drums.\r\n\r\nTh\\xc3\\xa9ophile, whom Prince Istar had dragged to the meeting, rose, pale and unstrung, and, speaking with emotion, said:\r\n\r\n\"Brethren, do not take ill what I am about to say; for it is the friendship I have for you that inspires me. I am but a poor musician. But, believe me, all your plans will come to naught before the Divine Wisdom which has foreseen everything.\"\r\n\r\nTh\\xc3\\xa9ophile Belais sat down amid hisses. And Arcade continued:\r\n\r\n\"Ialdabaoth foresees everything. I do not contest it. He foresees everything, but in order to leave us our free will he acts towards us absolutely as if he foresaw nothing. Every instant he is surprised, disconcerted; the most probable events take him unawares. The obligation which he has undertaken, to reconcile with his prescience the liberty of both men and angels, throws him constantly into inextricable difficulties and terrible dilemmas. He never sees further than the end of his nose. He did not expect Adam's disobedience, and so little did he anticipate the wickedness of men that he repented having made them, and drowned them in the waters of the Flood, and all the animals as well, though he had no fault to find with the animals. For blindness he is only to be compared with Charles X, his favourite king. If we are prudent it will be easy to take him by surprise. I think that these observations will be calculated to reassure my brother.\"\r\n\r\nTh\\xc3\\xa9ophile made no reply. He loved God, but he was fearful of sharing the fate of the faithful angel.\r\n\r\nOne of the best-informed Spirits of the assembly, Mammon, was not altogether reassured by the remarks of his brother Arcade.\r\n\r\n\"Bethink you,\" said this Spirit, \"Ialdabaoth has little general culture, but he is a soldier--to the marrow of his bones. The organisation of Paradise is a thoroughly military organisation. It is founded on hierarchy and discipline. Passive obedience is imposed there as a fundamental law. The angels form an army. Compare this spot with the Elysian Fields which Virgil depicts for you. In the Elysian Fields reign liberty, reason, and wisdom. The happy shades hold converse together in the groves of myrtle. In the Heaven of Ialdabaoth there is no civil population. Everyone is enrolled, numbered, registered. It is a barracks and a field for manoeuvres. Remember that.\"\r\n\r\nArcade replied that they must look at their adversary in his true colours, and that the military organisation of Paradise was far more reminiscent of the villages of King Koffee than of the Prussia of Frederick the Great.\r\n\r\n\"Already,\" said he, \"at the time of the first revolt, before the beginning of Time, the conflict raged for two days, and Ialdabaoth's throne was made to totter. Nevertheless, the demiurge gained the victory. But to what did he owe it? To the thunderstorm which happened to come on during the conflict. The thunderbolts falling on Lucifer and his angels struck them down, bruised and blackened, and Ialdabaoth owed his victory to the thunderbolts. Thunder is his sole weapon. He abuses its power. In the midst of thunder and lightning he promulgates his laws. 'Fire goeth before him,' says the Prophet. Now Seneca, the philosopher, said that the thunderbolt in its fall brings peril to very few, but fear to all. This remark was true enough for men of the first century of the Christian era; it is no longer so for the angels of the twentieth; all of which goes to prove that, in spite of his thunder, he is not very powerful; it was acute terror that made men rear him a tower of unbaked brick and bitumen. When myriads of celestial spirits, furnished with machines which modern science puts at their disposal, make an assault upon the heavens, think you, comrades, that the old master of the solar system surrounded with his angels, armed as in the time of Abraham, will be able to resist them? To this day the warriors of the demiurge wear helmets of gold and shields of diamond. Michael, his best captain, knows no other tactics than the hand-to-hand combat. To him Pharaoh's chariots are still the latest thing, and he has never heard of the Macedonian phalanx.\"\r\n\r\nAnd young Arcade lengthily prolonged the parallel between the armed herds of Ialdabaoth and the intelligent fighting men of the rebel army. Then the question of pecuniary resources arose.\r\n\r\nZita asserted that there was enough money to commence war, that the electrophores were in order, that an initial victory would obtain them credit.\r\n\r\nThe discussion continued, amid turbulence and confusion. In this parliament of angels, as in the synods of men, empty words flowed in abundance. Disturbances grew more violent and more frequent as the time for putting the resolution drew near. It was beyond question that supreme command would be entrusted to him who had first raised the flag of revolt. But as everyone aspired to act as Lucifer's Lieutenant, each in describing the kind of fighting man to be preferred drew a portrait of himself. Thus Alcor, the youngest of the rebellious angels, arose and spoke rapidly as follows:\r\n\r\n\"In Ialdabaoth's army, happily for us, the officers obtain their posts by seniority. This being the case, there is little likelihood of the command falling into the hands of a military genius, for men are not made leaders by prolonged habits of obedience, and close attention to minuti\\xc3\\xa6 is not a good apprenticeship for the evolution of vast plans of campaign. If we consult ancient and modern history, we shall see that the greatest leaders were kings like Alexander and Frederick, aristocrats like C\\xc3\\xa6sar and Turenne, or men impatient of red-tape like Bonaparte. A routine man will always be poor or second-rate. Comrades, let us appoint intelligent leaders, men in the prime of life, to command us. An old man may retain the habit of winning victories, but only a young man can acquire it!\"\r\n\r\nAlcor then gave place to an angel of the philosophic order, who mounted the rostrum and spoke thus:\r\n\r\n\"War never was an exact science, a clearly defined art. The genius of the race, or the brain of the individual, has ever modified it. Now how are we to define the qualities necessary for a general in command in the war of the future, where one must consider greater masses and a larger number of movements than the intelligence of man can conceive? The multiplication of technical means, by infinitely multiplying the opportunities for mistake, paralyses the genius of those in command. At a certain stage in the progress of military science, a stage which our models, the Europeans, are about to reach, the cleverest leader and the most ignorant become equalized by reason of their incapacity. Another result of great modern armaments is, that the law of numbers tends to rule with inflexible rigour. It is of course true that ten angels in revolt are worth more than ten angels of Ialdabaoth; it is not at all certain that a million rebellious angels are worth more than a million of Ialdabaoth's angels. Great numbers, in war as elsewhere, annihilate intelligence and individual superiority in favour of a sort of exceedingly rudimentary collective soul.\"\r\n\r\nA buzz of conversation drowned the voice of the philosophic angel, and he concluded his speech in an atmosphere of general indifference.\r\n\r\nThe tribune then resounded with calls to arms and promises of victory. The sword was held up to praise, the sword which defends the right. The triumph of the angels in revolt was celebrated twenty times beforehand, to the plaudits of a delirious crowd.\r\n\r\nCries of \"War!\" rose to the silent heavens; \"Give us war!\"\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these transports Prince Istar hoisted himself on to the platform, and the floor creaked under his weight.\r\n\r\n\"Comrades,\" said he, \"you wish for victory, and it is a very natural desire, but you must be mouldy with literature and poetry if you expect to obtain it from war. The idea of making war can nowadays only enter the brain of a sottish bourgeois or a belated romantic. What is war? A burlesque masquerade in the midst of which fatuous patriots sing their stupid dithyrambs. Had Napoleon possessed a practical mind he would not have made war; but he was a dreamer, intoxicated with Ossian. You cry, 'Give us war!' You are visionaries. When will you become thinkers? The thinkers do not look for power and strength from any of the dreams which constitute military art: tactics, strategy, fortifications, artillery, and all that rubbish. They do not believe in war, which is a phantasy; they believe in chemistry, which is a science. They know the way to put victory into an algebraic formula.\"\r\n\r\nAnd drawing from his pocket a small bottle, which he held up to the meeting, Prince Istar exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Victory--it is here!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n     WHEREIN WE SHALL SEE REVEALED A DARK AND SECRET MYSTERY AND      LEARN HOW IT COMES ABOUT THAT EMPIRES ARE OFTEN HURLED      AGAINST EMPIRES, AND RUIN FALLS ALIKE UPON THE VICTORS AND      THE VANQUISHED; AND THE WISE READER (IF SUCH THERE BE--WHICH      I DOUBT) WILL MEDITATE UPON THIS IMPORTANT UTTERANCE: \"A WAR      IS A MATTER OF BUSINESS\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Angels had dispersed. At the foot of the slopes at Meudon, seated on the grass, Arcade and Zita watched the Seine flowing by the willows.\r\n\r\n\"In this world,\" said Arcade, \"in this world, which we call a cosmos, though it is but a microcosm, no thinking being can imagine that he is able to destroy even one atom. At the utmost, all we can hope for is that we shall succeed in modifying, here and there, the rhythm of some group of atoms and the arrangement of certain cells. That, when one thinks of it, must be the limit of our great enterprise. And when we shall have set up the Contradictor in the place of Ialdabaoth, we shall have done no more.... Zita, is the evil in the nature of things or in their arrangement? That is what we ought to know. Zita, I am profoundly troubled----\"\r\n\r\n\"Arcade,\" replied Zita, \"if to act we had to know the secret of Nature, one would never act at all. And neither would one live--since to live is to act. Arcade, is your resolution failing you already?\"\r\n\r\nArcade assured the beautiful angel that he was resolved to plunge the demiurge into eternal darkness.\r\n\r\nA motor-car passed by on the road, followed by a long trail of dust. It stopped before the two angels, and the hooked nose of Baron Everdingen appeared at the window.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, my celestial friends, good morning,\" said the capitalist. \"Sons of Heaven, I am pleased to meet you. I have a word of importance to say to you. Do not remain idle--do not go to sleep. Arm! Arm! You may be surprised by Ialdabaoth. You have a big war-fund. Employ it without stint. I have just learnt that the Archangel Michael has given large orders in Heaven for thunderbolts and arrows. If you take my advice you will procure fifty thousand more electrophores. I will take the order. Good day, angels. Long live the celestial country!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Baron Everdingen flew by the flowery shores of Louveciennes in the company of a pretty actress.\r\n\r\n\"Is it true that they are taking up arms at the demiurge's?\" asked Arcade.\r\n\r\n\"It may be,\" replied Zita, \"that up there another Baron Everdingen is inciting to arms.\"\r\n\r\nThe guardian angel of young Maurice remained pensive for some moments. Then he murmured:\r\n\r\n\"Can it be that we are the sport of financiers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pooh!\" said the beautiful archangel. \"War is a business. It has always been a business.\"\r\n\r\nThen they discussed at length the means of executing their immense enterprise. Rejecting disdainfully the anarchistic proceedings of Prince Istar, they conceived a formidable and sudden invasion of the kingdom of Heaven by their enthusiastic and well-drilled troops.\r\n\r\nNow Barattan, the innkeeper of La Jonch\\xc3\\xa8re, who had let the entertainment-hall to the rebellious angels, was in the employ of the secret police. In the reports he furnished to the Prefecture he denounced the members of this secret meeting as meditating an attack on a certain person whom they described as obtuse and cruel, and whom they called _Alaballotte_. The agent believed this to be a pseudonym denoting either the President of the Republic or the Republic itself. The conspirators had unanimously given voice to threats against _Alaballotte_, and one of them, a very dangerous individual, well-known in anarchist circles, who had already several convictions against him on account of writings and speeches of a seditious nature, and who was known as Prince Istar or the _Qu\\xc3\\xa9roube_, had brandished a bomb of very small calibre which seemed to contain a formidable machine. The other conspirators were unknown to Barattan, notwithstanding the fact that he frequented revolutionary circles. Many among them were very young men, mere beardless youths. There were two who, it appeared, had spoken with conspicuous vehemence; a certain Arcade, dwelling in the Rue St. Jacques, and a woman of easy virtue called Zita, living at Montmartre, both without visible means of subsistence.\r\n\r\nThe affair seemed sufficiently serious to the Prefect of Police to make him think it necessary to confer without delay with the President of the Council.\r\n\r\nThe Third Republic was then going through one of those climacteric periods during which the French nation, enamoured of authority and worshipping force, gave itself up for lost because it was not governed enough, and clamoured loudly for a saviour. The President of the Council, and Minister of Justice, was only too eager to be that longed-for saviour. Still, for him to play that part it was first necessary that there should be a danger to face. Thus the news of a plot was highly welcome to him. He questioned the Prefect of Police on the character and importance of the affair. The Prefect of Police explained that the people seemed to have money, intelligence, and energy; but that they talked too much and were too numerous to undertake secret and concerted action. The Minister, leaning back in his arm-chair, pondered on the matter. The Empire writing-table at which he was seated, the ancient tapestry which covered the walls, the clock and the candelabra of the Restoration period--all, in this traditional setting, reminded him of those great principles of government which remain immutable throughout the succession of _r\\xc3\\xa9gimes_, of stratagem and of bluff. After brief reflexion, he concluded that the plot must be allowed to grow and take shape, that it would even be fitting to nurse it, to embroider it, to colour it, and only to stifle it after having extracted every possible advantage from it.\r\n\r\nHe instructed the Prefect of Police to watch the affair closely, to render him an account of what went on from day to day, and to confine himself to the r\\xc3\\xb4le of informer.\r\n\r\n\"I rely on your well-known prudence; observe, and do not intervene.\"\r\n\r\nThe Minister lit a cigarette. He quite reckoned, with the help of this plot, on silencing the Opposition, strengthening his own influence, diminishing that of his colleagues, humiliating the President of the Republic, and becoming the saviour of his country.\r\n\r\nThe Prefect of Police undertook to follow the ministerial instructions, vowing inwardly all the while to act in his own way. He had a watch put upon the individuals pointed out by Barattan, and commanded his agents not to intervene, come what might. Perceiving that he was a marked man, Prince Istar--who united prudence with strength--withdrew the bombs from the gutter outside his window where he had hidden them, and changing from motor 'bus to tube, from tube to motor 'bus, and choosing the most cunningly circuitous route, at length deposited his machines with the angelic musician.\r\n\r\nEvery time he left his house in the Rue St. Jacques, Arcade found a man of exaggerated smartness at his door, with yellow gloves and in his tie a diamond bigger than the Regent. Being a stranger to the things of this world, the rebellious angel paid no attention to the circumstance. But young Maurice d'Esparvieu, who had undertaken the task of guarding his guardian-angel, viewed this gentleman with uneasiness, for he equalled in assiduity and surpassed in vigilance that Monsieur Mignon who had formerly allowed his inquisitive gaze to wander from the rams' heads on the H\\xc3\\xb4tel de la Sordi\\xc3\\xa8re in the Rue Garanci\\xc3\\xa8re to the apse of the church of St. Sulpice. Maurice came two and three times a day to see Arcade in his furnished rooms, warning him of the danger, and urging him to change his abode.\r\n\r\nEvery evening he took his angel to night restaurants, where they supped with ladies of easy virtue. There young d'Esparvieu would foretell the issue of some coming glove-fight, and afterwards exert himself to demonstrate to Arcade the existence of God, the necessity for religion, and the beauties of Christianity, and adjure him to renounce his impious and criminal undertakings wherefrom, he said, he would reap but bitterness and disappointment.\r\n\r\n\"For really,\" said the young apologist, \"if Christianity were false it would be known.\"\r\n\r\nThe ladies approved of Maurice's religious sentiments, and when the handsome Arcade uttered some blasphemy in language they could understand, they put their hands to their ears and bade him be silent, for fear of being struck down with him. For they believed that God, in his omnipotence and sovereign goodness, taking sudden vengeance against those who insulted him, was quite capable of striking down the innocent with the guilty without meaning it.\r\n\r\nSometimes the angel and his guardian took supper with the angelic musician. Maurice, who remembered from time to time that he was Bouchotte's lover, was displeased to see Arcade taking liberties with the singer. She had allowed him to do so ever since the day when, the angelic musician having had the little flowery couch repaired, Arcade and Bouchotte had made it a foundation for their friendship. Maurice, who loved Madame des Aubels a great deal, also loved Bouchotte a little, and was rather jealous of Arcade. Now jealousy is a feeling natural to man and beast, and causes them, however slight the attack, keen unhappiness. Therefore, suspecting the truth, which Bouchotte's temperament and the angel's character made sufficiently obvious, he overwhelmed Arcade with sarcasm and abuse, reproaching him with the immorality of his ways. Arcade answered, tranquilly, that it was difficult to subject physiological impulses to perfectly defined rules, and that moralists encountered great difficulties in the case of certain natural necessities.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover,\" added Arcade, \"I freely acknowledge that it is almost impossible systematically to constitute a natural moral law. Nature has no principles. She furnishes us with no reason to believe that human life is to be respected. Nature, in her indifference, makes no distinction between good and evil.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see, then,\" replied Maurice, \"that religion is necessary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Moral law,\" replied the angel, \"which is supposed to be revealed to us, is drawn in reality from the grossest empiricism. Custom alone regulates morals. What Heaven prescribes is merely the consecration of ancient customs. The divine law, promulgated amid fireworks on some Mount Sinai, is never anything but the codification of human prejudice. And from this fact--namely, that morals change--religions which endure for a long time, such as Jud\\xc3\\xa6o-Christianity, vary their moral law.\"\r\n\r\n\"At any rate,\" said Maurice, whose intelligence was swelling visibly, \"you will grant me that religion prevents much profligacy and crime?\"\r\n\r\n\"Except when it promotes crime--as, for instance, the murder of Iphigenia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arcade,\" exclaimed Maurice, \"when I hear you argue, I rejoice that I am not an intellectual.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile, with his head bent over the piano, his face hidden by the long fair veil of his hair, bringing down from on high his inspired hands on to the keys, was playing and singing the full score of _Aline, Queen of Golconda_.\r\n\r\nPrince Istar used to come to their friendly reunions, his pockets filled with bombs and bottles of champagne, both of which he owed to the liberality of Baron Everdingen. Bouchotte received the Ker\\xc3\\xbbb with pleasure, since she saw in him the witness and the trophy of the victory she had gained on the little flowered couch. He was to her as the severed head of Goliath in the hands of the youthful David. And she admired the prince for his cleverness as an accompanist, his vigour, which she had subdued, and his prodigious capacity for drink.\r\n\r\nOne night, when young d'Esparvieu took his angel home in his car from Bouchotte's house to the lodgings in the Rue St. Jacques, it was very dark; before the door the diamond in the spy's necktie glittered like a beacon; three cyclists standing in a group under its rays made off in divers directions at the car's approach. The angel took no notice, but Maurice concluded that Arcade's movements interested various important people in the State. He judged the danger to be pressing, and at once made up his mind.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he came to seek the suspect, to take him to the Rue de Rome. The angel was in bed. Maurice urged him to dress and to follow him.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said he. \"This house is no longer safe for you. You are watched. One of these days you will be arrested. Do you wish to sleep in gaol? No? Well, then, come. I will put you in a safe place.\"\r\n\r\nThe spirit smiled with some little compassion on his na\\xc3\\xafve preserver.\r\n\r\n\"Do you not know,\" he said, \"that an angel broke open the doors of the prison where Peter was confined, and delivered the apostle? Do you believe me, Maurice, to be inferior in power to that heavenly brother of mine, and do you suppose that I am unable to do for myself what he did for the fisherman of the lake of Tiberias?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not count on it, Arcade. He did it miraculously.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or by a stroke of luck, as a modern historian of the Church has it. But no matter. I will follow you. Just allow me to burn a few letters and to make a parcel of some books I shall need.\"\r\n\r\nHe threw some papers in the fire-place, put several volumes in his pockets, and followed his guide to the car, which was waiting for them not far off, outside the College of France. Maurice took the wheel. Imitating the Ker\\xc3\\xbbb's prudence, he made so many windings and turnings, and so many rapid twists that he put all the swift and numerous cyclists, speeding in pursuit, off the scent. At length, having left wheelmarks in every direction all over the town, he stopped in the Rue de Rome, before the first-door flat, where the angel had first appeared.\r\n\r\nOn entering the dwelling which he had left eighteen months before to carry out his mission, Arcade remembered the irreparable past, and breathing in the scent used by Gilberte, his nostrils throbbed. He asked after Madame des Aubels.\r\n\r\n\"She is very well,\" replied Maurice. \"A little plumper and very much more beautiful for it. She still bears you a grudge for your forward behaviour. I hope that she will one day forgive you, as I have forgiven you, and that she will forget your offence. But she is still very annoyed with you.\"\r\n\r\nYoung d'Esparvieu did the honours of his flat to his angel with the manners of a well-bred man and the tender solicitude of a friend. He showed him the folding bed which was opened every evening in the entrance hall and pushed into a dark cupboard in the morning. He showed him the dressing-table, with its accessories; the bath, the linen cupboard, the chest of drawers; gave him the necessary information regarding the heating and lighting; told him that his meals would be brought and the rooms cleaned by the concierge, and showed him which bell to press when he required that person's services. He told him also that he must consider himself at home, and receive whom he wished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n     WHICH TREATS OF A PAINFUL DOMESTIC SCENE\r\n\r\n\r\nSo long as Maurice confined his selection of mistresses to respectable women, his conduct had called forth no reproach. It was a different matter when he took up with Bouchotte. His mother, who had closed her eyes to liaisons which, though guilty, were elegant and discreet, was scandalised when it came to her ears that her son was openly parading about with a music-hall singer. By dint of much prying and probing, Berthe, Maurice's younger sister, had got to know of her brother's adventures, and she narrated them, without any indignation, to her young girl friends. His little brother L\\xc3\\xa9on declared to his mother one day, in the presence of several ladies, that when he was big he, too, would go on the spree, like Maurice. This was a sore wound to the maternal heart of Madame d'Esparvieu.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time there occurred a family event of a very grave nature which occasioned much alarm to Monsieur Ren\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu. Drafts were presented to him signed in his name by his son. His writing had not been forged, but there was no doubt that it had been the son's intention to pass off the signature as his father's. It showed a perverted moral sense; whence it appeared that Maurice was living a life of profligacy, that he was running into debt and on the point of outraging the decencies. The paterfamilias talked the matter over with his wife. It was arranged that he should give his son a very severe lecture, hint at vigorous corrective measures, and that in due course the mother should appear with gentle and sorrowing mien and endeavour to soothe the righteous indignation of the father. This plan being agreed upon, Monsieur Ren\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu sent for his son to come to him in his study. To add to the solemnity of the occasion, he had arrayed himself in his frock-coat. As soon as Maurice saw it he knew there was something serious in the wind. The head of the family was pale, and his voice shook a little (for he was a nervous man), as he declared that he would no longer put up with his son's irregular behaviour, and insisted on an immediate and absolute reform. No more wild courses, no more running into debt, no more undesirable companions, but work, steadiness, and reputable connexions.\r\n\r\nMaurice was quite willing to give a respectful reply to his father, whose complaints, after all, were perfectly justified; but, unfortunately, Maurice, like his father, was shy, and the frock-coat which Monsieur d'Esparvieu had donned in order to discharge his magisterial duty with greater dignity seemed to preclude the possibility of any open and unconstrained intercourse. Maurice maintained an awkward silence, which looked very much like insolence, and this silence compelled Monsieur d'Esparvieu to reiterate his complaints, this time with additional severity. He opened one of the drawers in his historic bureau (the bureau on which Alexandre d'Esparvieu had written his \"Essay on the Civil and Religious Institutions of the World\"), and produced the bills which Maurice had signed.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, my boy,\" said he, \"that this is nothing more nor less than forgery? To make up for such grave misconduct as that----\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment Madame d'Esparvieu, as arranged, entered the room attired in her walking-dress. She was supposed to play the angel of forgiveness, but neither her appearance nor her disposition was suitable to the part. She was harsh and unsympathetic. Maurice harboured within him the seeds of all the ordinary and necessary virtues. He loved his mother and respected her. His love, however, was more a matter of duty than of inclination, and his respect arose from habit rather than from feeling. Madame Ren\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu's complexion was blotchy, and having powdered herself in order to appear to advantage at the domestic tribunal, the colour of her face suggested raspberries sprinkled over with sugar. Maurice, being possessed of some taste, could not help realising that she was ugly and rather repulsively so. He was out of tune with her, and when she began to go through all the accusations his father had brought against him, making them out to be blacker than ever, the prodigal turned away his head to conceal his irritation.\r\n\r\n\"Your Aunt de Saint-Fain,\" she went on, \"met you in the street in such disgraceful company that she was really thankful that you forbore to greet her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aunt de Saint-Fain!\" Maurice broke out. \"I like to hear her talking about scandals! Everyone knows the sort of life she has led, and now the old hypocrite wants to----\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped. He had caught sight of his father, whose face was even more eloquent of sorrow than of anger. Maurice began to feel as though he had committed murder, and could not imagine how he had allowed such words to escape him. He was on the point of bursting into tears, falling on his knees, and imploring his father to forgive him, when his mother, looking up at the ceiling, said with a sigh:\r\n\r\n\"What offence can I have committed against God, to have brought such a wicked son into the world?\"\r\n\r\nThis speech struck Maurice as a piece of ridiculous affectation, and it pulled him up with a jerk. The bitterness of contrition suddenly gave place to the delicious arrogance of wrong-doing. He plunged wildly into a torrent of insolence and revolt, and breathlessly delivered himself of utterances quite unfit for a mother's ear.\r\n\r\n\"If you will have it, mamma, rather than forbid me to continue my friendship with a talented lyrical artist, you would be better employed in preventing my elder sister, Madame de Margy, from appearing, night after night, in society and at the theatres with a contemptible and disgusting individual that everybody knows is her lover. You should also keep an eye on my little sister Jeanne, who writes objectionable letters to herself in a disguised hand, and then, pretending she has found them in her prayer-book, shows them to you with assumed innocence, to worry and alarm you. It would be just as well, too, if you prevented my little brother L\\xc3\\xa9on, a child of seven, from being quite so much with Mademoiselle Caporal, and you might tell your maid....\"\r\n\r\n\"Get out, sir, I will not have you in the house!\" cried Monsieur Ren\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu, white with anger, pointing a trembling finger at the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n     WHEREIN WE SEE HOW THE ANGEL, HAVING BECOME A MAN, BEHAVES      LIKE A MAN, COVETING ANOTHER'S WIFE AND BETRAYING HIS      FRIEND. IN THIS CHAPTER THE CORRECTNESS OF YOUNG      D'ESPARVIEU'S CONDUCT WILL BE MADE MANIFEST\r\n\r\n\r\nThe angel was pleased with his lodging. He worked of a morning, went out in the afternoon, heedless of detectives, and came home to sleep. As in days gone by, Maurice received Madame des Aubels twice or thrice a week in the room in which they had seen the apparition.\r\n\r\nAll went very well until one morning Gilberte, having, the night before, left her little velvet bag on the table in the blue room, came to find it, and discovered Arcade stretched on the couch in his pyjamas, smoking a cigarette, and dreaming of the conquest of Heaven. She gave a loud scream.\r\n\r\n\"You, Monsieur! Had I thought to find you here, you may be quite sure I should not ... I came to fetch my little bag, which is in the next room. Allow me....\" And she slipped past the angel, cautiously and quickly, as if he were a brazier.\r\n\r\nMadame des Aubels that morning, in her pale green tailor-made costume, was deliciously attractive. Her tight skirt displayed her movements, and her every step was one of those miracles of Nature which fill men's hearts with amazement.\r\n\r\nShe reappeared, bag in hand.\r\n\r\n\"Once more--I ask your pardon.... I never dreamt that....\"\r\n\r\nArcade begged her to sit down and to stay a moment.\r\n\r\n\"I never expected, Monsieur,\" said she, \"that you would be doing the honours of this flat. I knew how dearly Monsieur d'Esparvieu loved you.... Nevertheless, I had no idea that....\"\r\n\r\nThe sky had suddenly grown overcast. A brownish glare began to steal into the room. Madame des Aubels told him she had walked for her health's sake, but a storm was brewing, and she asked if a carriage could be called for her.\r\n\r\nArcade flung himself at Gilberte's feet, took her in his arms as one takes a precious piece of china, and murmured words which, being meaningless in themselves, expressed desire.\r\n\r\nShe put her hands over his eyes and on his lips, and exclaimed, \"I hate you!\"\r\n\r\nAnd shaking with sobs, she asked for a drink of water. She was choking. The angel went to her assistance. In this moment of extreme peril she defended herself courageously. She kept saying: \"No!... No!... I will not love you. I should love you too well....\" Nevertheless she succumbed.\r\n\r\nIn the sweet familiarity which followed their mutual astonishment she said to him:\r\n\r\n\"I have often asked after you. I knew that you were an assiduous frequenter of the playhouses at Montmartre,--that you were often seen with Mademoiselle Bouchotte, who, nevertheless, is not at all pretty. I knew that you had become very smart, and that you were making a good deal of money. I was not surprised. You were born to succeed. The day of your\"--and she pointed at the spot between the window and the wardrobe with the mirror--\"apparition, I was vexed with Maurice for having given you a suicide's rags to wear. You pleased me.... Oh, it was not your good looks! Don't think that women are as sensitive as people say to outward attractions. We consider other things in love. There is a sort of---- Well, anyhow I loved you as soon as I saw you.\"\r\n\r\nThe shadows grew deeper.\r\n\r\nShe asked:\r\n\r\n\"You are not an angel, are you? Maurice believes you are; but he believes so many things, Maurice.\" She questioned Arcade with her eyes and smiled maliciously. \"Confess that you have been fooling him, and that you are no angel?\"\r\n\r\nArcade replied:\r\n\r\n\"I only aspire to please you; I will always be what you want me to be.\"\r\n\r\nGilberte decided that he was no angel; first, because one never is an angel; secondly, for more detailed reasons which drew her thoughts to the question of love. He did not argue the matter with her, and once again words were found inadequate to express their feelings.\r\n\r\nOutside, the rain was falling thick and fast, the windows were streaming, lightning lit up the muslin curtains, and thunder shook the panes. Gilberte made the sign of the Cross and remained with her head hidden in her lover's bosom.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Maurice entered the room. He came in wet and smiling, confident, tranquil, happy, to announce to Arcade the good news that with his half-share in the previous day's race at Longchamps the angel had won twelve times his stake. Surprising the lady and the angel in their embrace, he became furious; anger gripped the muscles of his throat, his face grew red with blood, and the veins stood out on his forehead. He sprang with clenched fists towards Gilberte, and then suddenly stopped.\r\n\r\nInterrupted motion was transformed into heat. Maurice fumed. His anger did not arm him, like Archilochus, with lyrical vengeance. He merely applied an offensive epithet to his unfaithful one.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile she had recovered her dignified bearing. She rose, full of modesty and grace, and gave her accuser a look which expressed both offended virtue and loving forgiveness.\r\n\r\nBut as young d'Esparvieu continued to shower coarse and monotonous insults on her, she grew angry in her turn.\r\n\r\n\"You are a pretty sort of person, are you not?\" she said. \"Did I run after this Arcade of yours? It was you who brought him here, and in what a state, too! You had only one idea: to give me up to your friend. Well, Monsieur, you can do as you like--I am not going to oblige you.\"\r\n\r\nMaurice d'Esparvieu replied simply, \"Get out of it, you trollop!\" And he made a motion as if to push her out. It pained Arcade to see his mistress treated so disrespectfully, but he thought he lacked the necessary authority to interfere with Maurice. Madame des Aubels, who had lost none of her dignity, fixed young d'Esparvieu with her imperious gaze, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Go and get me a carriage.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so great is the power of woman over a well-bred soul, in a gallant nation, that the young Frenchman went immediately and told the concierge to call a taxi. Madame des Aubels, with a studied exhibition of charm in every movement, took leave of them, throwing Maurice the contemptuous look that a woman owes to him whom she has deceived. Maurice witnessed her departure with an outward expression of indifference he was far from feeling. Then he turned to the angel clad in the flowered pyjamas which Maurice himself had worn the day of the apparition; and this circumstance, trifling in itself, added fuel to the anger of the host who had been thus shamefully deceived.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, \"you may pride yourself on being a despicable individual. You have behaved basely, and all for nothing. If the woman took your fancy, you had but to tell me. I was tired of her. I had had enough of her. I would have willingly left her to you.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke thus to hide his pain, for he loved Gilberte more than ever, and the creature's treachery caused him great suffering. He pursued:\r\n\r\n\"I was about to ask you to take her off my hands. But you have followed your lower nature--you have behaved like a sweep.\"\r\n\r\nIf at this solemn moment Arcade had but spoken one word from his heart, Maurice would have burst into tears, and forgiven his friend and his mistress, and all three would have become content and happy once again. But Arcade had not been nourished on the milk of human kindness. He had never suffered, and did not know how to sympathise with suffering. He replied with frigid wisdom:\r\n\r\n\"My dear Maurice, that same necessity which orders and constrains the actions of living beings, produces effects that are often unexpected, and sometimes absurd. Thus it is that I have been led to displease you. You would not reproach me if you had a good philosophical understanding of nature; for you would then know that free-will is but an illusion, and that physiological affinities are as exactly determined as are chemical combinations, and, like them, may be summed up in a formula. I think that, in your case, it might be possible to inculcate these truths, but it would be a difficult task, and maybe they would not bring you the serenity which eludes you. It is fitting, therefore, that I should leave this spot, and----\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay,\" said Maurice.\r\n\r\nMaurice had a very clear sense of social obligations. He put honour, when he thought about it, above everything. So now he told himself very forcibly that the outrage he had suffered could only be wiped out with blood. This traditional idea instantly lent an unexpected nobility to his speech and bearing.\r\n\r\n\"It is I, Monsieur,\" said he, \"who will quit this place, never to return. You will remain here, since you are a refugee. My seconds will wait upon you.\"\r\n\r\nThe angel smiled.\r\n\r\n\"I will receive them, if it gives you pleasure, but, bethink you, my dear Maurice, I am invulnerable. Celestial spirits even when they are materialised cannot be touched by point of sword or pistol shot. Consider, my dear Maurice, the awkward situation in which this fatal inequality puts me, and realise that in refusing to appoint seconds I cannot give as a reason my celestial nature,--it would be unprecedented.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur,\" replied the heir of the Bussart d'Esparvieu, \"you should have thought of that before you insulted me.\"\r\n\r\nOut he marched haughtily; but no sooner was he in the street than he staggered like a drunken man. The rain was still falling. He walked unseeing, unhearing, at haphazard, dragging his feet in the gutters through pools of water, through heaps of mud. He followed the outer boulevards for a long time, and at length, fordone with weariness, lay down on the edge of a piece of waste land. He was muddied up to the eyes, mud and tears smeared his face, the brim of his hat was dripping with rain. A passer-by, taking him for a beggar, tossed him a copper. He picked it up, put it carefully in his waistcoat pocket, and set off to find his seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n     WHICH TREATS OF AN AFFAIR OF HONOUR, AND WHICH WILL AFFORD      THE READER AN OPPORTUNITY OF JUDGING WHETHER, AS ARCADE      AFFIRMS, THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR FAULTS MAKES BETTER MEN AND      WOMEN OF US\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ground chosen for the combat was Colonel Manchon's garden, on the Boulevard de la Reine at Versailles. Messieurs de la Verdeli\\xc3\\xa8re and Le Truc de Ruffec, who had both of them constant practice in affairs of honour and knew the rules with great exactness, assisted Maurice d'Esparvieu. No duel was ever fought in the Catholic world without Monsieur de la Verdeli\\xc3\\xa8re being present; and, in making application to this swordsman, Maurice had conformed to custom, though not without a certain reluctance, for he had been notorious as the lover of Madame de la Verdeli\\xc3\\xa8re; but Monsieur de la Verdeli\\xc3\\xa8re was not to be looked upon as a husband. He was an institution. As to Monsieur Le Truc de Ruffec, honour was his only known profession and avowedly his sole resource, and when the matter was made the subject of ill-natured comment in Society, the question was asked what finer career than that of honour Monsieur Le Truc de Ruffec could possibly have adopted. Arcade's seconds were Prince Istar and Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile. The celestial musician had not voluntarily nor with a good grace taken a hand in this affair. He had a horror of every kind of violence and disapproved of single combat. The report of pistols and the clash of swords were intolerable to him, and the sight of blood made him faint. This gentle son of Heaven had obstinately refused to act as second to his brother Arcade, and to bring him to the starting-point the Ker\\xc3\\xbbb had had to threaten to break a bottle of panclastite over his head.\r\n\r\nBesides the combatants, the seconds, and the doctors, the only people in the garden were a few officers from the barracks at Versailles and several reporters. Although young d'Esparvieu was known merely as a young man of family, and Arcade had never been heard of at all, the duel had attracted quite a large crowd of inquisitive individuals, and the windows of the adjoining houses were crammed with photographers, reporters, and Society people. What had aroused much curiosity was that a woman was known to be the cause of the quarrel. Many mentioned Bouchotte, but the majority said it was Madame des Aubels. It had been remarked upon, moreover, that duels in which Monsieur de la Verdeli\\xc3\\xa8re acted as second drew all Paris.\r\n\r\nThe sky was a soft blue, the garden all a-bloom with roses, a blackbird was piping in a tree. Monsieur de la Verdeli\\xc3\\xa8re, who, stick in hand, conducted the affair, laid the points of the swords together, and said:\r\n\r\n\"_Allez, Messieurs._\"\r\n\r\nMaurice d'Esparvieu attacked by doubling and beating the blade. Arcade retired, keeping his sword in line. The first engagement was without result. The seconds were under the impression that Monsieur d'Esparvieu was in a grievous state of nervous irritability, and that his adversary would wear him down. In the second encounter Maurice attacked wildly, spread out his arms, and exposed his breast. He attacked as he advanced, gave a straight thrust, and the point of his sword grazed Arcade on the shoulder. The latter was thought to be wounded. But the seconds ascertained with surprise that it was Maurice who had received a scratch on the wrist. Maurice asserted that he felt nothing, and Dr. Quille declared, after examination, that his client might continue the fight. After the regulation quarter of an hour the duel was resumed. Maurice attacked with fury. His adversary was obviously nursing him, and, what disturbed Monsieur de la Verdeli\\xc3\\xa8re, seemed to be paying very little attention to his own defence. At the opening of the fifth bout, a black spaniel that had got into the garden no one knew how rushed out from a clump of rose-bushes, made its way on to the space reserved for the combatants, and, in spite of sticks and cries, ran in between Maurice's legs. The latter seemed as though his arm were benumbed, merely gave a shoulder-thrust at his invulnerable opponent. He then delivered a straight lunge and impaled his arm on his adversary's sword, which made a deep wound just below the elbow.\r\n\r\nMonsieur de la Verdeli\\xc3\\xa8re stopped the fight, which had lasted an hour and a half. Maurice was conscious of a painful shock. They laid him down on a grassy bank against a wall covered with wistaria. While the surgeon was dressing the wound Maurice called Arcade and offered him his wounded hand. And when the victor, saddened with his victory, advanced, Maurice embraced him tenderly, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Be generous, Arcade; forgive my treachery. Now that we have fought, I can ask you to be reconciled with me.\"\r\n\r\nHe embraced his friend, weeping, and whispered in his ear:\r\n\r\n\"Come and see me, and bring Gilberte.\"\r\n\r\nMaurice, who was still unreconciled with his parents, was taken to the little flat in the Rue de Rome. No sooner was he stretched on the bed at the far end of the bedroom where the curtains were drawn as on the day of the apparition, than he saw Arcade and Gilberte appear. He began to suffer greatly from his wound; his temperature was rising, but he was at peace, happy and contented. Angel and woman, both in tears, threw themselves at the foot of the bed. He took both their hands with his left, smiled on them, and kissed them tenderly.\r\n\r\n\"I am sure now that I shall never quarrel with either of you again; you will deceive me no more. I now know you are capable of anything.\"\r\n\r\nGilberte, weeping, swore that Maurice had been misled by appearances, that she had never betrayed him with Arcade, that she had never betrayed him at all. And in a great gush of sincerity she persuaded herself that this was so.\r\n\r\n\"You wrong yourself, Gilberte,\" replied the wounded man. \"It did happen; it had to. And it is well. Gilberte, you were basely false to me with my best friend in this very room, and you were right. If you had not been we should not be here, reunited, all three of us, and I should not be at your side tasting the greatest happiness of my life. Oh, Gilberte, how wrong of you to deny a perfect and accomplished fact!\"\r\n\r\n\"If you wish, my friend,\" replied Gilberte, a little acidly, \"I will not deny it. But it will only be to please you.\"\r\n\r\nMaurice made her sit down on the bed, and begged Arcade to be seated in the arm-chair.\r\n\r\n\"My friend,\" said Arcade, \"I was innocent. I became man. Straightway I did evil. Then I became better.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not let us exaggerate things,\" said Maurice. \"Let's have a game of bridge.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely, however, had the patient seen three aces in his hand and called \"no trumps,\" than his eyes began to swim, the cards slipped from his fingers, head fell heavily back on the pillow, and he complained of a violent headache. Almost immediately, Madame des Aubels went off to pay some calls, for she made a point of appearing in Society, in order that the calmness and confidence of her demeanour might give the lie to the various rumours that were current concerning her. Arcade saw her to the door, and, with a kiss, inhaled from her a delicate perfume which he brought back with him into the room where Maurice lay dozing.\r\n\r\n\"I am perfectly content,\" murmured the latter, \"that things should have happened as they have.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was bound to be so,\" answered the Spirit. \"All the other angels in revolt would have done as I did with Gilberte. 'Women,' saith the Apostle, 'should pray with their heads covered, because of the angels,' and the Apostle speaks thus because he knows that the angels are disturbed when they look upon them and see that they are beautiful. No sooner do they touch the earth than they desire to embrace mortal women and fulfil their desire. Their clasp is full of strength and sweetness, they hold the secret of those ineffable caresses which plunge the daughters of men into unfathomable depths of delight. Laying upon the lips of their happy victims a honey that burns like fire, making their veins flow with torrents of refreshing flames, they leave them raptured and undone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop your clatter, you unclean beast,\" cried the wounded one.\r\n\r\n\"One word more!\" said the angel; \"just one other word, my dear Maurice, to bear out what I say, and I will let you rest quietly. There's nothing like having sound references. In order to assure yourself that I am not deceiving you, Maurice, on this subject of the amorous embraces of angels and women, look up Justin, _Apologies_, I and II; Flavius Josephus, _Jewish Antiquities_, Book I, Chapter III; Athenagoras, _Concerning the Resurrection_; Lactantius, Book II, Chapter XV; Tertullian, _On the Veil of the Virgins_; Marcus of Ephesus in _Psellus_; Eusebius, _Pr\\xc3\\xa6paratio Evangelica_, Book V, Chapter IV; Saint Ambrose, in his book on _Noah and the Ark_, Chapter V; Saint Augustine, in his _City of God_, Book XV, Chapter XXIII; Father Meldonat, the Jesuit, _Treatise on Demons_, page 248; Pierre Lebyer the King's Counsellor----\"\r\n\r\n\"Arcade, please, for pity's sake, be quiet; do, please do, and send this dog away,\" cried Maurice, whose face was burning, and whose eyes were starting from his head; for in his delirium he thought he saw a black spaniel on his bed.\r\n\r\nMadame de la Verdeli\\xc3\\xa8re, who was assiduous in every modish and patriotic practice, was reckoned, in the best French society, as one of the most gracious of the great ladies interested in good works. She came herself to ask for news of Maurice, and offered to nurse the wounded man. But at the vehement instigation of Madame des Aubels, Arcade shut the door in her face. Expressions of sympathy were showered upon Maurice. Piled on the salver, visiting cards displayed their innumerable little dogs' ears. Monsieur Le Truc de Ruffec was one of the first to show his manly sympathy at the flat in the Rue de Rome, and, holding out his loyal hand, asked young d'Esparvieu as one honourable man to another for twenty-five louis to pay a debt of honour.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, my dear Maurice, that is the sort of thing one could not ask of everybody.\"\r\n\r\nThe same day Monsieur Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan came to press his nephew's hand. The latter introduced Arcade.\r\n\r\n\"This is my guardian angel, whose foot you thought so beautiful when you saw the print it had made on the tell-tale powder, uncle. He appeared to me last year in this very room. You don't believe it? Well, it is true, nevertheless.\"\r\n\r\nThen turning towards the Spirit he said:\r\n\r\n\"What say you, Arcade? The Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Patouille, who is a great theologian and a good priest, does not believe that you are an angel; and Uncle Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan, who doesn't know his catechism and hasn't a scrap of religion in him, doesn't think so either. They deny you, the pair of them; the one because he has faith, the other because he hasn't. After that you may be sure that your history, if ever it comes to be narrated, will scarcely appear credible. Moreover, the man that took it into his head to tell your story would not be a man of taste, and would not come in for much approval. For your story is not a pretty one. I love you, but I sit in judgment upon you, too. Since you fell into atheism, you have become an abominable scoundrel. A bad angel, a bad friend, a traitor, and a homicide, for I suppose it was to bring about my death that you sent that black spaniel between my legs on the duelling-ground.\"\r\n\r\nThe angel shrugged his shoulders and, addressing Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan, said:\r\n\r\n\"Alas! Monsieur, I am not surprised at finding little credit in your eyes. I have been told that you have fallen out with the Jud\\xc3\\xa6o-Christian heaven, which is where I came from.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur,\" answered Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan, \"my faith in Jehovah is not sufficiently strong to enable me to believe in his angels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur, he whom you call Jehovah is really a coarse and ignorant demiurge, and his name is Ialdabaoth.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case, Monsieur, I am perfectly ready to believe in him. He is a narrow-minded ignoramus, is he? Then belief in his existence offers me no further difficulty. How is he getting on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Badly! We are going to lay him low next month.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't make too sure of that, Monsieur. You remind me of my brother-in-law, Cuissart, who has been expecting to hear of the fall of the Republic for the past thirty years.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see, Arcade,\" exclaimed Maurice, \"Uncle Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan thinks as I do. He knows you won't succeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, pray, Monsieur Ga\\xc3\\xa9tan, what makes you think I shall not succeed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Ialdabaoth is still very powerful in this world, if he isn't in the other. In days gone by he used to be upheld by his priests, by those who believed in him. Now he is supported by those who do not believe in him, by the philosophers. A pedant of a fellow called Picrochole has recently come on the scene who wants to make a bankrupt of science in order to do a good turn to the Church. And just lately Pragmatism has been invented for the express purpose of gaining credit for religion in the minds of rationalists.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been studying Pragmatism?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I! I was frivolous once, and I went in for metaphysics. I read Hegel and Kant. I have become serious with years, and now I only trouble myself about things evident to the senses: what the eye can see or what the ear can hear. Man is summed up in Art. All the rest is moonshine.\"\r\n\r\nThus the conversation went on until evening; it was marked by obscenities that would have brought a blush--I will not say to a cuirassier, for cuirassiers are frequently chaste, but even to a Parisienne.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Sariette came to see his old pupil. When he entered the room the bust of Alexandre d'Esparvieu seemed to take shape behind the librarian's bald head. He drew near the bed. In the place of blue curtains, mirrored wardrobe, and chimney-piece, there straightway came into view the heavy-laden bookcases of the room of the globes and busts, and the air was heavy with piles of papers, records, and files. Monsieur Sariette could not be dissociated from his library; one could not conceive of him or even see him apart from it. He himself was paler, more vague, more shadowy, and more a creature of the fancy than the fancies he evoked.\r\n\r\nMaurice, who had grown very quiet, was sensible of this mark of friendship.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, Monsieur Sariette,--you know Madame des Aubels. May I introduce Arcade to you,--my guardian angel. It was he who, while yet invisible, pillaged your library for two years, made you lose all desire for food and drink, and drove you to the verge of madness. He it was who moved piles of books from the room of the busts to my summer-house one day; under your very nose, he took away I know not what precious volumes; and was the cause of your falling on the staircase; another day he took a volume of Salomon Reinach's, and, forced to go out with me (for he never left me, as I have learnt later), he let the volume drop in the gutter of the Rue Princesse. Forgive him, Monsieur Sariette,--he had no pockets. He was invisible. I bitterly regret, Monsieur Sariette, that all your old books were not devoured by fire or swallowed up by a flood. They made my angel lose his head. He became man, and now knows neither faith nor obedience to laws. It is I, now, who am his guardian angel. God knows how it will all end.\"\r\n\r\nWhile listening to this speech, Monsieur Sariette's face took on an expression of infinite, irreparable, eternal sadness; the sadness of a mummy. Rising to take his leave, the sorrowful librarian murmured in Arcade's ear:\r\n\r\n\"The poor child is very ill. He is delirious.\"\r\n\r\nMaurice called the old man back.\r\n\r\n\"Do stay, Monsieur Sariette. You shall have a game of bridge with us. Monsieur Sariette, listen to my advice. Do not do as I did--do not keep bad company. You will be lost. I shudder at the mere thought. Monsieur Sariette, do not go yet. I have something very important to ask you. When you come again, bring me a book on the truth of religion, so that I may study it. I must restore to my guardian-angel the faith which he has lost.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n     WHEREIN WE ARE LED TO MARVEL AT THE READINESS WITH WHICH AN      HONEST MAN OF TIMID AND GENTLE NATURE CAN COMMIT A HORRIBLE      CRIME\r\n\r\n\r\nProfoundly distressed by the dark utterances of young Maurice, Monsieur Sariette took a motor-omnibus, and went to see P\\xc3\\xa8re Guinardon, his friend, his only friend, the one person in the whole world whom it gave him pleasure to see and hear. When Monsieur Sariette entered the shop in the Rue de Courcelles, Guinardon was alone, dozing in the depths of an antique arm-chair. His face, surrounded by his curly hair and luxuriant beard, was crimson in hue. Little violet filaments spread a network about the fleshy part of his nose, to which the wines of Burgundy had imparted a purple tint; for there was no longer any disguising the fact, P\\xc3\\xa8re Guinardon drank. Two feet away from him, on the fair Octavie's work-table, a rose, all but withered, drooped in an empty vase, and in a basket a piece of embroidery was lying unfinished and neglected. The young Octavie's absences from the shop were growing more and more frequent, and Monsieur Blancmesnil never called when she was not there. The reason of this was that they were meeting three times a week at five o'clock in a house close to the Champs \\xc3\\x89lys\\xc3\\xa9es. P\\xc3\\xa8re Guinardon knew nothing of that. He did not know the full extent of his misfortune, but he suffered.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Sariette shook his old friend by the hand; but he did not enquire for the young Octavie, for he refused to recognise the connexion. He would sooner have talked about Z\\xc3\\xa9phyrine, who had been so cruelly deserted, and whom he hoped the old man would make his lawful wife. But Monsieur Sariette was prudent. He contented himself with asking Guinardon how he was.\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly well,\" was Guinardon's reply; but he felt ill, for either age and love-making had undermined his sturdy constitution, or else young Octavie's faithlessness had dealt her lover a fatal blow. \"God be praised,\" he went on, \"I still retain my powers of mind and body. I am chaste. Be chaste, Sariette. Chastity is strength.\"\r\n\r\nThat evening P\\xc3\\xa8re Guinardon had taken some specially valuable books out of the king-wood cabinet to show to a distinguished bibliophile, Monsieur Victor Meyer, and after the latter's departure he had dropped off to sleep without putting them back in their places. Books had an attraction for Monsieur Sariette, and seeing these particular volumes on the marble top of the cabinet, he began to examine them with interest. The first one he looked at was _La Pucelle_, in morocco, with the English continuation. Doubtless it pained his patriotic and Christian heart to admire its text and illustrations, but a good copy was always virtuous and pure in his sight. Continuing to chat very affectionately with Guinardon, he picked up, one by one, the books which the antiquary had, for one reason or another--binding, illustrations, distinguished ownership, or scarcity--added to his stock.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a glorious shout of joy and love broke from his lips. He had discovered the _Lucretius_ of the Prior de Vend\\xc3\\xb4me, his _Lucretius_, and he was clasping it to his bosom.\r\n\r\n\"Once again I behold you,\" he sighed, as he pressed it to his lips.\r\n\r\nAt first P\\xc3\\xa8re Guinardon could not quite make out what his old friend was talking about; but when the latter declared to him that the volume was from the d'Esparvieu collection, that it belonged to him, Sariette, and that he was going to take it away without further ado, the antiquary completely woke up, got on his legs, declared emphatically that the book belonged to him, Guinardon, by right of true and lawful purchase, and that he would not part with it unless he got five thousand francs for it cash down.\r\n\r\n\"You don't take in what I am telling you,\" answered Sariette. \"The book belongs to the d'Esparvieu library; I must restore it to its place.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Pas de \\xc3\\xa7a, Lisette_\"---- hummed Guinardon.\r\n\r\n\"The book belongs to me, I tell you!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are crazy, my good Sariette!\"\r\n\r\nAnd noticing that, as a matter of fact, the librarian had a wandering look in his eye, he took the book from him, and tried to change the conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen, Sariette, that the rascals are going to rip up the Palais Mazarin, and cover up the very heart and centre of the Old Town, the finest and most venerable place in the whole of Paris, with the deuce knows what works of art of theirs? They are worse than the Vandals, for the Vandals, although they destroyed the buildings of antiquity, did not replace them with hideous and disgusting erections and atrocious bridges like the Pont d'Alexandre. And your poor Rue Garanci\\xc3\\xa8re, Sariette, has fallen a prey to the barbarians. What have they done with the pretty bronze mask of the Palace fountain?\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur Sariette never listened to a word of all this.\r\n\r\n\"Guinardon, you have not understood me. Now listen. This book belongs to the d'Esparvieu library. It was taken away, how or by whom I know not. Dreadful and mysterious things went on in that library. But, anyhow, the book was stolen. I need scarcely appeal to your sentiments of scrupulous probity, my dear friend. You would not like to be regarded as the receiver of stolen goods. Give me the book. I will return it to Monsieur d'Esparvieu, who will duly requite you; of that you may be sure. Rely on his generosity, and you will be acting like the downright good fellow that you are.\"\r\n\r\nThe antiquary smiled a bitter smile.\r\n\r\n\"Catch me relying on the generosity of that old curmudgeon of a d'Esparvieu. Why, he'd skin a flea to get its coat. Look at me, Sariette, old boy, and tell me if I look like a dunderhead. You know perfectly well that d'Esparvieu refused to give fifty francs in a second-hand shop for a portrait of Alexandre d'Esparvieu, the founder of the family, by Hersent, and that consequently the founder of the family has had to remain on the Boulevard Montparnasse, propped against a Jew hawker's stall, just opposite the cemetery, where all the dogs of the neighbourhood come and make water on him. Catch me trusting to Monsieur d'Esparvieu's liberality! You've got some bright ideas in your head, you have!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Guinardon, I myself will undertake to pay you any indemnity that a board of arbitrators may fix upon. Do you hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now don't go and do the handsome for people who won't give you so much as a thank-you. This man, d'Esparvieu, has taken your knowledge, your energies, your whole life for a salary that even a valet wouldn't accept. So leave that idea alone. In any case it is too late. The book is sold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sold? To whom?\" asked Sariette in agonized tones.\r\n\r\n\"What does that matter? You'll never see it again. You'll hear no more about it; it's off to America.\"\r\n\r\n\"To America! The _Lucretius_ with the arms of Philippe de Vend\\xc3\\xb4me and marginalia in Voltaire's own hand! My _Lucretius_ off to America!\"\r\n\r\nP\\xc3\\xa8re Guinardon began to laugh.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Sariette, you remind me of the Chevalier des Grieux when he learns that his darling mistress is to be transported to the Mississippi. 'My dear mistress going to the Mississippi!' says he.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! no!\" answered Sariette, very pale, \"this book shall not go to America. It shall return, as it ought, to the d'Esparvieu library. Let me have it, Guinardon.\"\r\n\r\nThe antiquary made a second attempt to put an end to an interview that now looked as if it might take an ugly turn.\r\n\r\n\"My good Sariette, you haven't told me what you think of my Greco. You never so much as glanced at it. It is an admirable piece of work all the same.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Guinardon, putting the picture in a good light, went on:\r\n\r\n\"Now just look at Saint Francis here, the poor man of the Lord, the brother of Jesus. See how his fuliginous body rises heavenward like the smoke from an agreeable sacrifice, like the sacrifice of Abel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me the book, Guinardon,\" said Sariette, without turning his head; \"give me the book.\"\r\n\r\nThe blood suddenly flew to P\\xc3\\xa8re Guinardon's head.\r\n\r\n\"That's enough of it,\" he shouted, as red as a turkey-cock, the veins standing out on his forehead.\r\n\r\nAnd he dropped the _Lucretius_ into his jacket pocket.\r\n\r\nStraightway old Sariette flew at the antiquary, assailed him with sudden fury, and, frail and weakly as he was, butted him back into young Octavie's arm-chair.\r\n\r\nGuinardon, in furious amazement, belched forth the most horrible abuse on the old maniac and gave him a punch that sent him staggering back four paces against the _Coronation of the Virgin_, by Fra Angelico, which fell down with a crash. Sariette returned to the charge, and tried to drag the book out of the pocket in which it lay hid. This time P\\xc3\\xa8re Guinardon would really have floored him had he not been blinded by the blood that was rushing to his head, and hit sideways at the work-table of his absent mistress. Sariette fastened himself on to his bewildered adversary, held him down in the arm-chair, and with his little bony hands clutched him by the neck, which, red as it was already, became a deep crimson. Guinardon struggled to get free, but the little fingers, feeling the mass of soft, warm flesh about them, embedded themselves in it with delicious ecstasy. Some unknown force made them hold fast to their prey. Guinardon's throat began to rattle, saliva was oozing from one corner of his mouth. His enormous frame quivered now and again beneath the grasp; but the tremors grew more and more intermittent and spasmodic. At last they ceased. The murderous hands did not let go their hold. Sariette had to make a violent effort to loose them. His temples were buzzing. Nevertheless he could hear the rain falling outside, muffled steps going past on the pavement, newspaper men shouting in the distance. He could see umbrellas passing along in the dim light. He drew the book from the dead man's pocket and fled.\r\n\r\nThe fair Octavie did not go back to the shop that night. She went to sleep in a little entresol underneath the bric-a-brac stores which Monsieur de Blancmesnil had recently bought for her in this same Rue de Courcelles. The workman whose task it was to shut up the shop found the antiquary's body still warm. He called Madame Lenain, the concierge, who laid Guinardon on the couch, lit a couple of candles, put a sprig of box in a saucer of holy water, and closed the dead man's eyes. The doctor who was called in to certify the death ascribed it to apoplexy.\r\n\r\nZ\\xc3\\xa9phyrine, informed of what had happened by Madame Lenain, hastened to the house, and sat up all night with the body. The dead man looked as if he were sleeping. In the flickering light of the candles El Greco's Saint mounted upwards like a wreath of smoke, the gold of the Primitives gleamed in the shadows. Near the deathbed a little woman by Baudouin was plainly discernible giving herself a douche. All through the night Z\\xc3\\xa9phyrine's lamentations could be heard fifty yards away.\r\n\r\n\"He's dead, he's dead!\" she kept saying. \"My friend, my divinity, my all, my love---- But no! he is not dead, he moves. It is I, Michel; I, your Z\\xc3\\xa9phyrine. Awake, hear me! Answer me; I love you; if ever I caused you pain, forgive me. Dead! dead! O my God! See how beautiful he is. He was so good, so clever, so kind. My God! My God! My God! If I had been there he would not now be lying dead. Michel! Michel!\"\r\n\r\nWhen morning came she was silent. They thought she had fallen asleep. She was dead too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n     WHICH DESCRIBES HOW NECTAIRE'S FLUTE WAS HEARD IN THE TAVERN      OF CLODOMIR\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame de la Verdeli\\xc3\\xa8re having failed to force an _entr\\xc3\\xa9e_ as sick-nurse, returned after several days had elapsed,--during the absence of Madame des Aubels,--to ask Maurice d'Esparvieu for his subscription to the French churches. Arcade led her to the bedside of the convalescent. Maurice whispered in the angel's ear:\r\n\r\n\"Traitor, deliver me from this ogress immediately, or you will be answerable for the evil which will soon befall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be calm,\" said Arcade, with a confident air.\r\n\r\nAfter the conventional complimentary flourishes, Madame de la Verdeli\\xc3\\xa8re signed to Maurice to dismiss the angel. Maurice feigned not to understand. And Madame de la Verdeli\\xc3\\xa8re disclosed the ostensible reason of her visit.\r\n\r\n\"Our churches,\" she said, \"our beloved country churches,--what is to become of them?\"\r\n\r\nArcade gazed at her angelically and sighed.\r\n\r\n\"They will disappear, Madame; they will fall into ruin. And what a pity! I shall be inconsolable. The church amid the villagers' cottages is like the hen amidst her chickens.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so!\" exclaimed Madame de la Verdeli\\xc3\\xa8re with a delighted smile. \"It is just like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the spires, Madame?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Monsieur, the spires!...\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the spires, Madame, that stick up into the skies towards the little Cherubim, like so many syringes.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de la Verdeli\\xc3\\xa8re incontinently left the place.\r\n\r\nThat same day Monsieur l'Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Patouille came to offer the wounded man good counsel and consolation. He exhorted him to break with his bad companions and to be reconciled to his family.\r\n\r\nHe drew a picture of the sorrowful father, the mother in tears, ready to receive their long-lost child with open arms. Renouncing with manly effort a life of profligacy and deluding joys, Maurice would recover his peace and strength of mind, he would free himself from devouring chimeras, and shake off the Evil Spirit.\r\n\r\nYoung d'Esparvieu thanked Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Patouille for all his kindness, and made a protestation of his religious feelings.\r\n\r\n\"Never,\" said he, \"have I had such faith. And never have I been in such need of it. Just imagine, Monsieur l'Abb\\xc3\\xa9, I have to teach my guardian angel his catechism all over again, for he has quite forgotten it!\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur l'Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Patouille heaved a deep sigh, and exhorted his dear child to pray, there being no other resource but prayer for a soul assailed by the Devil.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur l'Abb\\xc3\\xa9,\" asked Maurice, \"may I introduce my guardian angel to you? Do stay a moment; he has gone to get me some cigarettes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unhappy child!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Patouille's fat cheeks drooped in token of affliction. But almost immediately they plumped up again, as a sign of light-heartedness. For in his heart there was matter for rejoicing. Public opinion was improving. The Jacobins, the Freemasons, the Coalitionists were everywhere in disgrace. The Smart Set led the way. The Acad\\xc3\\xa9mie Fran\\xc3\\xa7aise was of the right way of thinking. The number of Christian schools was increasing by leaps and bounds. The young men of the Quartier Latin were submitting to the Church, and the \\xc3\\x89cole Normale exhaled the perfume of the seminary. The Cross was gaining the day; but money was wanted,--more money, always money.\r\n\r\nAfter six weeks' rest, Maurice was allowed by his doctor to take a drive. He wore his arm in a sling. His mistress and his friend went with him. They drove to the Bois, and took a gentle pleasure in looking upon the grass and the trees. They smiled on everything and everything smiled on them. As Arcade had said, their faults had made them better. By the unlooked-for ways of jealousy and anger, Maurice had attained to calm and kindliness. He still loved Gilberte and he loved her with an indulgent love. The angel still desired her as much as ever, but having once possessed her, his desire had lost the sting of curiosity. Gilberte forbore trying to please, and thereby pleased the more. They drank milk at the Cascade, and found it good. They were all three innocent. Arcade forgot the injustice of the old tyrant of the world. But he was soon to be reminded of it.\r\n\r\nOn entering his friend's house, he found Zita awaiting him, looking like a statue in ivory and gold.\r\n\r\n\"You excite my pity,\" she said to him. \"The day is at hand the like of which has never dawned since the beginning of Time, and perhaps will never dawn again before the Sun enters with all its train into the constellation of Hercules. We are on the eve of surprising Ialdabaoth in his palace of porphyry, and you, who are burning to deliver the heavens, who were so eager to enter in triumph into your emancipated country,--you suddenly forget your noble purpose and fall asleep in the arms of the daughters of men. What pleasure can you find in intercourse with these unclean little animals, composed, as they are, of elements so unstable that they may be said to be in a state of constant evanescence? O Arcade! I was indeed right to distrust you. You are but an intellectual; you do but feel idle curiosity. You are incapable of action.\"\r\n\r\n\"You misjudge me, Zita,\" replied the angel. \"It is the nature of the sons of heaven to love the daughters of men. Corruptible though it be, the material part of women and of flowers charms the senses none the less. But not one of these little animals can make me forget my hatred and my love, and I am ready to rise up against Ialdabaoth.\"\r\n\r\nZita expressed her satisfaction at seeing him in this resolute mood. She urged him to pursue the accomplishment of this vast undertaking with undiminished ardour. Nothing must be hurried or deferred.\r\n\r\n\"A great action, Arcade, is made up of a multitude of small ones; the most majestic whole is composed of a thousand minute details. Let us neglect nothing.\"\r\n\r\nShe had come to take him to a meeting where his presence was required. They were to take a census of the revolutionaries.\r\n\r\nShe added but one word:\r\n\r\n\"Nectaire will be there.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Maurice saw Zita, he deemed her lacking in attraction. She failed to please him because she was perfectly beautiful and because true beauty always caused him painful surprise. Zita inspired him with antipathy when he learned that she was an angel in revolt and that she had come to seek Arcade to take him away among the conspirators.\r\n\r\nThe poor child tried to retain his companion by all the means that his wit and the circumstances afforded him. If his guardian angel would only remain with him, he would take him to a magnificent boxing-match, to a \"revue\" where he would witness the apotheosis of Poincar\\xc3\\xa9, or, lastly, to a certain house he knew of where he would behold women remarkable for their beauty, talents, vices, or deformities. But the angel would not allow himself to be tempted, and said he was going with Zita.\r\n\r\n\"What for?\"\r\n\r\n\"To plot the conquest of the skies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still the same nonsense! The conquest of---- but there, I proved to you that it was neither possible nor desirable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good night, Maurice.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are going? Well, I will accompany you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Maurice, his arm in a sling, went with Arcade and Zita all the way to Clodomir's restaurant at Montmartre, where the tables were laid in an arbour in the garden.\r\n\r\nPrince Istar and Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile were already there, with a little creature who looked like a child, and was, in fact, a Japanese angel.\r\n\r\n\"We are only waiting for Nectaire,\" said Zita.\r\n\r\nAnd at that moment the old gardener noiselessly appeared. He took his seat, and his dog lay down at his feet. French cooking is the best in the world. It is a glory that will transcend all others when humanity has grown wise enough to put the spit above the sword. Clodomir served the angels, and the mortal who was with them, with a soup made of cabbages and bacon, a loin of pork and kidneys cooked in wine, thereby proving himself a real Montmartre cook, and showing that he had not been spoilt by the Americans, who corrupt the most excellent _chefs_ of the City of Restaurants.\r\n\r\nClodomir brought forth some Bordeaux, which, though unrecorded among the renowned vintages of M\\xc3\\xa9doc, gave evidence by its choice and delicate aroma of the high nobility of its origin. We must not omit to chronicle that, after this wine and many others had been drunk, the cellarman, in solemn state, produced a Burgundy choice and rare, full-bodied yet not heavy, generous yet delicate, rich with the true Burgundian mellowness, a noble and, withal, a somewhat heady wine, that brought delight alike to mind and sense.\r\n\r\n\"Hail to thee, Dionysus, greatest of the Gods!\" cried old Nectaire, raising his glass on high. \"I drink to thee who wilt restore the Golden Age, and give again to mortal men, who will become heroes as of old, the grapes which the Lesbians used to cull, long since, from the vines of Methymna; who wilt restore the vineyards of Thasus, the white clusters of Lake Mareotis, the storehouses of Falernus, the vines of the Tmolus, and the wine of Phanae, of all wines the king. And the juice thereof shall be divine, and, as in old Silenus' day, men shall grow drunk with Wisdom and with Love.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the coffee was served, Prince Istar, Zita, Arcade, and the Japanese angel took it in turns to give an account of the forces assembled against Ialdabaoth. Angels, in exchanging eternal bliss for the sufferings of an earthly life, grow in intelligence, acquire the means of going astray and the faculty of self-contradiction. Consequently their meetings, like those of men, are tumultuous and confused. Did one of them deal in figures, the others immediately called them in question. They could not add one number to another without quarrelling, and arithmetic itself, subjected to passion, lost its certitude. The Ker\\xc3\\xbbb, who had brought with him the pious Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile, waxed indignant when he heard the musician praising the Lord, and rained down such blows on his head as would have felled an ox. But the head of a musician is harder than a bucranium, and the blows which Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile received did not avail to modify that angel's notion of divine providence. Arcade, having at great length set up his scientific idealism in opposition to Zita's pragmatism, the beautiful archangel told him that he argued badly.\r\n\r\n\"And you are surprised at that!\" exclaimed young Maurice's guardian angel. \"I argue, like you, in the language of human beings. And what is human language but the cry of the beasts of the forests or the mountains, complicated and corrupted by arrogant anthropoids. How then, Zita, can one be expected to argue well with a collection of angry or plaintive sounds like that? Angels do not reason at all; men, being superior to the angels, reason imperfectly. I will not mention the professors who think to define the absolute with the aid of cries that they have inherited from the pithecanthropoid monkeys, marsupials, and reptiles, their ancestors! It is a colossal joke! How it would amuse the demiurge, if he had any brains!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful starlight night. The gardener was silent.\r\n\r\n\"Nectaire,\" said the beautiful archangel, \"play to us on your flute, if you are not afraid that the Earth and Heaven will be stirred to their depths thereby.\"\r\n\r\nNectaire took up his flute. Young Maurice lighted a cigarette. The flame burnt brightly for a moment, casting back the sky and its stars into the shadows, and then died out. And Nectaire sang of the flame on his divine flute. The silvery voice soared aloft and sang:\r\n\r\n\"That flame was a whole universe which fulfilled its destiny in less than a minute. Suns and planets were formed therein. Venus Urania apportioned the orbits of the wandering spheres in those infinite spaces. Beneath the breath of Eros--the first of the gods,--plants, animals, and thoughts sprang into being. In the twenty seconds which hurried by betwixt the life and death of those worlds, civilizations were unfolded, and empires sank in long decline. Mothers shed tears, and songs of love, cries of hatred, and sighs of victims rose upward to the silent skies.\r\n\r\n\"In proportion to its minuteness, that universe lasted as long as this one--whereof we see a few atoms glittering above our heads--has lasted or will last. They are, one no less than the other, but a gleam in the Infinite.\"\r\n\r\nAs the clear, pure notes welled up into the charmed air, the earth melted into a soft mist, the stars revolved rapidly in their orbits, the Great Bear fell asunder, its parts flew far and wide. Orion's belt was shattered; the Pole Star forsook its magnetic axis. Sirius, whose incandescent flame had lit up the far horizon, grew blue, then red, flickered, and suddenly died out. The shaken constellations formed new signs which were extinguished in their turn. By its incantations the magic flute had compressed into one brief moment the life and the movement of this universe which seems unchanging and eternal both to men and angels. It ceased, and the heavens resumed their immemorial aspect. Nectaire had vanished. Clodomir asked his guests if they were pleased with the cabbage soup which, in order that it might be strong, had been kept simmering for twenty-four hours on the fire, and he sang the praises of the Beaujolais which they had drunk.\r\n\r\nThe night was mild. Arcade, accompanied by his guardian angel, Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile, Prince Istar, and the Japanese angel, escorted Zita home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n     HOW A DREADFUL CRIME PLUNGES PARIS INTO A STATE OF TERROR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe city was asleep. Their footsteps rang loudly on the deserted pavement. Having reached the corner of the Rue Feutrier, half-way up Montmartre, the little company halted before the dwelling of the beautiful angel. Arcade was talking about the Thrones and Dominations with Zita, who, her finger on the bell, could not make up her mind to ring. Prince Istar was tracing the mechanism of a new sort of bomb on the pavement with the end of his stick, and bellowed so loudly that he woke the sleeping citizens and stirred into activity the amatory passions of the neighbouring Pasipha\\xc3\\xabs. Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile was singing the barcarole from the second act of _Aline, Queen of Golconda_ at the top of his voice. Maurice, his arm in a sling, was fencing left-handed with the Japanese, striking sparks from the pavement, and crying \"A hit! a hit!\" in a piercing voice.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Inspector Grolle at the corner of the next street was dreaming. He had the bearing of a Roman legionary and displayed all the characteristics of that proudly servile race, who, ever since men first took to building cities, have been the mainstay of Empires and the support of ruling houses. Inspector Grolle was very strong, but very tired. He suffered from an arduous profession and from lack of food. He was a man devoted to duty, but still a man, and he was unable to resist the wiles, the charms, and the blandishments of the gay ladies whom he met in swarms in the shadows along the empty streets and round about pieces of waste ground; he loved them. He loved like a soldier under arms. It tired him, but courage conquered fatigue. Though he had not yet reached the middle of Life's way, he longed for sweet repose and peaceful country pursuits. At the corner of the Rue Muller, on this mild night, he stood lost in thought. He was dreaming of the house where he was born, of the little olive wood, of his father's bit of ground, of his old mother, bent with long and heavy labour, whom he would never see again. Roused from his reverie by the nocturnal tumult, Inspector Grolle turned the corner of the street, and looked rather unfavourably at the band of loiterers, wherein his social instinct suspected enemies of law and order. He was patient and resolute. After a lengthy silence, he said, with awe-inspiring calm:\r\n\r\n\"Move on, there!\"\r\n\r\nBut Maurice and the Japanese angel were fencing and heard nothing. The musician heard nothing but his own melodies. Prince Istar was absorbed in the explanation of explosive formul\\xc3\\xa6. Zita was discussing with Arcade the greatest enterprise that had ever been conceived since the solar system issued from its original nebula,--and thus they all remained unconscious of their surroundings.\r\n\r\n\"Move on, I tell you!\" repeated Inspector Grolle.\r\n\r\nThis time the angels heard the solemn word of warning, but either through indifference or contempt, they neglected to obey, and continued their talk, their songs, and their cries.\r\n\r\n\"So you want to be taken up, do you?\" shouted Inspector Grolle, clapping his great hand on Prince Istar's shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe Ker\\xc3\\xbbb was indignant at this vile contact, and with one blow from his formidable fist sent the Inspector flying into the gutter. But Constable Fesandet was already running to his comrade's aid, and they both fell upon the Prince, whom they belaboured with mechanic fury, and whom, notwithstanding his strength and weight, they would perchance have dragged all bleeding to the police station, had not the Japanese angel overset them one after the other without effort, and reduced them to writhing and shrieking in the mud, before Maurice, Arcade, and Zita had time to intervene. As to the angelic musician, he stood apart trembling, and invoked the heavens.\r\n\r\nAt this moment two bakers who were kneading their dough in a neighbouring cellar ran out at the noise, in their white aprons, stripped to the waist. With an instinctive feeling for social solidarity they took the side of the downfallen police. Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile conceived a just fear at the sight of them, and fled away; they caught him and were about to hand him over to the guardians of the peace, when Arcade and Zita tore him from their hands. The fight continued, unequal and terrible, between the two angels and the two bakers. Like an athlete of Lysippus in strength and beauty, Arcade smothered his heavy adversary in his arms. The beautiful archangel drove her dagger into the baker who had attacked her. A dark stream of blood flowed down over his hairy chest, and the two white-capped supporters of the law sank to the ground.\r\n\r\nConstable Fesandet had fainted face downwards in the gutter. But Inspector Grolle, who had got up, blew a blast on his whistle loud enough to be heard at the neighbouring police-station, and sprang upon young Maurice, who, having but one arm with which to defend himself, fired his revolver with his left hand at the inspector, who put his hand to his heart, staggered, and dropped down. He gave a long sigh, and the shadows of eternity darkened his eyes.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, windows opened one by one, and heads looked out on the street. A sound of heavy steps approached. Two policemen on bicycles debouched upon the street. Thereupon Prince Istar flung a bomb which shook the ground, put out the gas, shattered some of the houses, and enveloped the flight of young Maurice and the angels in a dense smoke.\r\n\r\nArcade and Maurice came to the conclusion that the safest thing to do after this adventure was to return to the little flat in the Rue de Rome. They would certainly not be sought for immediately and probably not at all, the bomb thrown by the Ker\\xc3\\xbbb having fortunately wiped out all witnesses of the affair. They fell asleep towards dawn, and they had not yet awoke at ten o'clock in the morning when the concierge brought their tea. While eating his toast and butter and slice of ham, young d'Esparvieu remarked to the angel:\r\n\r\n\"I used to think that a murder was something very extraordinary. Well, I was mistaken. It is the simplest, the most natural action in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"And of most ancient tradition,\" replied the angel. \"For long centuries it was both usual and necessary for man to kill and despoil his fellows. It is still recommended in warfare. It is also honourable to attempt human life in certain definite circumstances, and people approved when you wanted to assassinate me, Maurice, because it appeared to you that I had been intimate with your mistress. But killing a police-inspector is not the action of a man of fashion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be silent,\" exclaimed Maurice, \"be silent, scoundrel! I killed the poor Inspector instinctively, not knowing what I was doing. I am grieved to my heart about it. But it is not I, it is you who are the guilty one; you who are the murderer. It was you who lured me along this path of revolt and violence which leads to the pit. You have been my undoing. You have sacrificed my peace of mind, my happiness, to your pride and your wickedness, and all in vain; for I warn you, Arcade, you will not succeed in what you are undertaking.\"\r\n\r\nThe concierge brought in the newspapers. On seeing them Maurice grew pale. They announced the outrage in the Rue de Ramey in huge headlines:\r\n\r\n\"An Inspector killed--Two cyclist policemen and two bakers seriously wounded--Three houses blown up, numerous victims.\"\r\n\r\nMaurice let the paper drop, and said in a weak, plaintive voice:\r\n\r\n\"Arcade, why did you not slay me in the little garden at Versailles amidst the roses, to the song of the blackbirds?\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile terror reigned in Paris. In the public squares, and in the crowded streets, house-wives, string-bag in hand, grew pale as they listened to the story of the crime, and consigned the perpetrators to the most dreadful punishment. Shop-keepers, standing at the doors of their shops, put it all down to the anarchists, syndicalists, socialists, and radicals, and demanded that special measures should be taken against them.\r\n\r\nThe more thoughtful people recognized the handiwork of the Jew and the German, and demanded the expulsion of all aliens. Many vaunted the ways of America and advocated lynching. In addition to the printed news sinister rumours became current. Explosions had been heard at various places; everywhere bombs had been discovered; everywhere individuals, taken for malefactors, had been struck down by the popular arm and given up to justice, torn to ribbons. On the Place de la R\\xc3\\xa9publique a drunkard who was crying \"Down with the police\" was torn to pieces by the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe President of the Council and Minister of Justice held long conferences with the Prefect of Police, and they agreed to take immediate action. In order to allay the excitement of the Parisians, they arrested five or six hooligans out of the thirty thousand which the Capital contains. The chief of the Russian police, believing he recognised in this attack the methods of the Nihilists, demanded, on behalf of his Government, that a dozen refugees should be given up. The demand was immediately granted. Proceedings were also taken for certain individuals to be extradited to ensure the safety of the King of Spain.\r\n\r\nOn learning of these energetic measures, Paris breathed once more, and the evening papers congratulated the Government. There was excellent news of the wounded. They were out of danger and identified as their assailants all who were brought before them.\r\n\r\nTrue, Inspector Grolle was dead; but two Sisters of Mercy kept vigil at his side, and the President of the Council came and laid the Cross of Honour on the breast of this victim of duty.\r\n\r\nAt night there were panics. In the Avenue de la R\\xc3\\xa9volte the police, noticing a travelling acrobat's caravan on a piece of waste ground, took it for the retreat of a band of robbers. They whistled for help, and when they were a goodly number, attacked the caravan. Some worthy citizens joined them; fifteen thousand revolver-shots were fired, the caravan was blown up with dynamite, and among the d\\xc3\\xa9bris they found the corpse of a monkey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n     WHICH CONTAINS AN ACCOUNT OF THE ARREST OF BOUCHOTTE AND      MAURICE, OF THE DISASTER WHICH BEFELL THE D'ESPARVIEU      LIBRARY, AND OF THE DEPARTURE OF THE ANGELS\r\n\r\n\r\nMaurice d'Esparvieu passed a terrible night. At the least sound he seized his revolver that he might not fall alive into the hands of justice. When morning came he snatched the newspapers from the hands of the concierge, devoured them greedily, and gave a cry of joy; he had just read that Inspector Grolle having been taken to the Morgue for the post-mortem, the police-surgeons had only discovered bruises and contusions of a very superficial nature, and stated that death had been brought about by the rupture of an aneurism of the aorta.\r\n\r\n\"You see, Arcade,\" he exclaimed triumphantly; \"you see I am not an assassin. I am innocent. I could never have imagined how extremely agreeable it is to be innocent.\"\r\n\r\nThen he grew thoughtful, and--no unusual phenomenon--reflection dissipated his gaiety.\r\n\r\n\"I am innocent,--but there is no disguising the fact,\" he said, shaking his head, \"I am one of a band of malefactors. I live with miscreants. You are in your right place there, Arcade, for you are deceitful, cruel, and perverse. But I come of good family and have received an excellent education, and I blush for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I also,\" said Arcade, \"have received an excellent education.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where was that?\"\r\n\r\n\"In Heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Arcade, no; you never had any education. If good principles had been inculcated into you, you would still hold them. Such principles are never lost. In my childhood I learnt to revere my family, my country, my religion. I have not forgotten the lesson and I never shall. Do you know what shocks me most in you? It is not your perversity, your cruelty, your black ingratitude; it is not your agnosticism, which may be borne with at a pinch; it is not your scepticism, though it is very much out of date (for since the national awakening there is no longer any scepticism in France);--no, what disgusts me in you is your lack of taste, the bad style of your ideas, the inelegance of your doctrines. You think like an intellectual, you speak like a freethinker, you have theories which reek of radicalism and Combeism and all ignoble systems. Get along with you! you disgust me. Arcade, my old friend, Arcade, my dear angel, Arcade, my beloved child, listen to your guardian angel! Yield to my prayers, renounce your mad ideas; become good, simple, innocent, and happy once more. Put on your hat, come with me to N\\xc3\\xb4tre-Dame. We will say a prayer and burn a candle together.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile public opinion was still active in the matter; the leading papers, the organs of the national awakening, in articles of real elevation and real depth, unravelled the philosophy of this monstrous attack which was revolting to the conscience. They discovered the real origin, the indirect but effective cause in the revolutionary doctrines which had been disseminated unchecked, in the weakening of social ties, the relaxing of moral discipline, in the repeated appeals to every appetite, to every greedy desire. It would be needful, so as to cut down the evil at its root, to repudiate as quickly as possible all such chimeras and Utopias as syndicalism, the income-tax, etc., etc., etc. Many newspapers, and these not the least important, pointed out that the recrudescence of crime was but the natural fruit of impiety and concluded that the salvation of society lay in an unanimous and sincere return to religion. On the Sunday which followed the crime the congregations in the churches were noticed to be unusually large.\r\n\r\nJudge Salneuve, who was entrusted with the task of investigation, first examined the persons arrested by the police, and lost his way among attractive but illusory clues; however, the report of the detective Montremain, which was laid before him, put him on the right road, and soon led him to recognise the miscreants of La Jonch\\xc3\\xa8re as the authors of the crime of the Rue de Ramey. He ordered a search to be made for Arcade and Zita, and issued a warrant against Prince Istar, on whom the detectives laid hands as he was leaving Bouchotte's, where he had been depositing some bombs of new design. The Ker\\xc3\\xbbb, on learning the detectives' intentions, smiled broadly and asked them if they had a powerful motor-car. On their replying that they had one at the door, he assured them that was all he wanted. Thereupon he felled the two detectives on the stairs, walked up to the waiting car, flung the chauffeur under a motor-'bus which was opportunely passing, and seized the steering wheel under the eyes of the terrified crowd.\r\n\r\nThat same evening Monsieur Jeancourt, the Police Magistrate, entered Th\\xc3\\xa9ophile's rooms just when Bouchotte was swallowing a raw egg to clear her voice, for she was to sing her new song, \"They haven't got any in Germany,\" at the \"National Eldorado\" that evening. The musician was absent. Bouchotte received the Magistrate, and received him with a hauteur which intensified the simplicity of her attire; Bouchotte was _en d\\xc3\\xa9shabille_. The worthy Magistrate seized the score of _Aline, Queen of Golconda_, and the love-letters which the singer carefully preserved in the drawer of the table by her bed, for she was an orderly young woman. He was about to withdraw when he espied a cupboard, which he opened with a careless air, and found machines capable of blowing up half Paris, and a pair of large white wings, whose nature and use appeared inexplicable to him. Bouchotte was invited to complete her toilette, and, in spite of her cries, was taken off to the police-station.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Salneuve was indefatigable. After the examination of the papers seized in Bouchotte's house, and acting on the information of Montremain, he issued a warrant for the arrest of young d'Esparvieu, which was executed on Wednesday, the 27th May, at seven o'clock in the morning, with great discretion. For three days Maurice had neither slept nor eaten, loved nor lived. He had not a moment's doubt as to the nature of the matutinal visit. At the sight of the police magistrate a strange calm fell on him. Arcade had not returned to sleep in the flat. Maurice begged the magistrate to wait for him, dressed with care, and then accompanied the magistrate a calmness of mind which was barely disturbed when the door of the Conciergerie closed on him. Alone in his cell, he climbed upon the table to look out. His tranquillity was due to his weariness of spirit, to his numbed senses, and to the fact that he no longer stood in fear of arrest. His misfortune endowed him with superior wisdom. He felt he had fallen into a state of grace. He did not think too highly or too humbly of himself, but left his cause in the hands of God. With no desire to cover up his faults, which he would not hide even from himself, he addressed himself in mind to Providence, to point out that if he had fallen into disorder and rebellion it was to lead his erring angel back into the straight path. He stretched himself on the couch and slept in peace.\r\n\r\nOn hearing of the arrest of a music-hall singer and of a young man of fashion, both Paris and the provinces felt painful surprise. Deeply stirred by the tragic accounts which the leading newspapers were bringing out, the general idea was that the sort of people the authorities ought to bring to justice were ferocious anarchists, all reeking and dripping from deeds of blood and arson; but they failed to understand what the world of Art and Fashion should have to do with such things. At this news, which he was one of the last to hear, the President of the Council and Keeper of the Seals started up in his chair. The Sphinxes that adorned it were less terrible than he, and in the throes of his angry meditation he cut the mahogany of his imperial table with his penknife, after the manner of Napoleon. And when Judge Salneuve, whose attendance he had commanded, appeared before him, the President flung his penknife in the grate, as Louis XIV flung his cane out of the window in the presence of Lauzun; and it cost him a supreme effort to master himself and to say in a voice of suppressed fury:\r\n\r\n\"Are you mad? Surely I said often enough that I meant the plot to be anarchist, anti-social, fundamentally anti-social and anti-governmental, with a shade of syndicalism. I have made it clear enough that I wanted it kept within these lines; and what do you go and make of it?... The vengeance of anarchists and aspirants to freedom? Whom do you arrest? A singer adored of the nationalist public, and the son of a man highly esteemed in the Catholic party, who receives our bishops and has the _entr\\xc3\\xa9e_ to the Vatican; a man who may be one day sent as ambassador to the Pope. At one blow you alienate one hundred and sixty Deputies and forty Senators of the Right on the very eve of a motion to discuss the question of religious pacification; you embroil me with my friends of to-day, with my friends of to-morrow. Was it to find out if you were in the same dilemma as des Aubels that you seized the love-letters of young Maurice d'Esparvieu? I can put your mind at rest on that point. You are, and all Paris knows it. But it is not to avenge your personal affronts that you are on the Bench.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur le Garde des Sceaux,\" murmured the Judge, nearly apoplectic and in a choked voice. \"I am an honest man.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a fool ... and a provincial. Listen to me; if Maurice d'Esparvieu and Mademoiselle Bouchotte are not released within half an hour I will crush you like a piece of glass. Be off!\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur Ren\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu went himself to fetch his son from the Conciergerie and took him back to the old house in the Rue Garanci\\xc3\\xa8re. The return was triumphant. The news had been disseminated that Maurice had with generous imprudence interested himself in an attempt to restore the monarchy, and that Judge Salneuve, the infamous freemason, the tool of Combes and Andr\\xc3\\xa9, had tried to compromise the young man by making him out to be an accomplice of a band of criminals.\r\n\r\nThat was what Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Patouille seemed to think, and he answered for Maurice as for himself. It was known, moreover, that breaking with his father, who had rallied to the support of the Republic, young d'Esparvieu was on the high road to becoming an out-and-out Royalist. The people who had an inside knowledge of things saw in his arrest the vengeance of the Jews. Was not Maurice a notorious anti-Semite? Catholic youths went forth to hurl imprecations at Judge Salneuve under the windows of his residence in the Rue Gu\\xc3\\xa9n\\xc3\\xa9gaud, opposite the Mint.\r\n\r\nOn the Boulevard du Palais a band of students presented Maurice with a branch of palm. Maurice made a charming reply.\r\n\r\nMaurice was overcome with emotion when he beheld the old house in which his childhood had been spent, and fell weeping into his mother's arms.\r\n\r\nIt was a great day, unhappily marred by one painful incident. Monsieur Sariette, who had lost his reason as a consequence of the shocking events that had taken place in the Rue de Courcelles, had suddenly become violent. He had shut himself up in the library, and there he had remained for twenty-four hours, uttering the most horrible cries, and, turning a deaf ear alike to threats and entreaties, refused to come out. He had spent the night in a condition of extreme restlessness, for all night long the lamp had been seen passing rapidly to and fro behind the curtains. In the morning, hearing Hippolyte shouting to him from the court below, he opened the window of the Hall of the Spheres and the Philosophers, and heaved two or three rather weighty tomes on to the old valet's head. The whole of the domestic staff--men, women, and boys--hurried to the spot, and the librarian proceeded to throw out books by the armful on to their heads. In view of the gravity of the situation, Monsieur Ren\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu did not disdain to intervene. He appeared in night-cap and dressing-gown, and attempted to reason with the poor lunatic, whose only reply was to pour forth torrents of abuse on the man whom till then he had worshipped as his benefactor, and to endeavour to crush him beneath all the Bibles, all the Talmuds, all the sacred books of India and Persia, all the Greek Fathers, and all the Latin Fathers, Saint John Chrysostom, Saint Gregory Nazianzen, Saint Augustine, Saint Jerome, all the apologists, ay! and under the _Histoire des Variations_, annotated by Bossuet himself! Octavos, quartos, folios came crashing down, and lay in a sordid heap on the courtyard pavement. The letters of Gassendi, of P\\xc3\\xa8re Mersenne, of Pascal, were blown about hither and thither by the wind. The lady's-maid who had stooped down to rescue some of the sheets from the gutter got a blow on the head from an enormous Dutch atlas. Madame Ren\\xc3\\xa9 d'Esparvieu had been terrified by the ominous sounds, and appeared on the scene without waiting to apply the finishing touches of powder and paint. When he caught sight of her, old Sariette became more violent than ever. Down they came one after another as hard as he could pelt them; the busts of the poets, philosophers, and historians of antiquity--Homer, \\xc3\\x86schylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Herodotus, Thucydides, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Demosthenes, Cicero, Virgil, Horace, Seneca, Epictetus--all lay scattered on the ground. The celestial sphere and the terrestrial globe descended with a terrifying crash that was followed by a ghastly hush, broken only by the shrill laughter of little L\\xc3\\xa9on, who was looking down on the scene from a window above. A locksmith having opened the library door, all the household hastened to enter, and found the aged Sariette entrenched behind piles of books, busily engaged in tearing and slashing away at the _Lucretius_ of the Prior de Vend\\xc3\\xb4me annotated in Voltaire's own hand. They had to force a way through the barricade. But the maniac, perceiving that his stronghold was being invaded, fled away and escaped on to the roof. For two whole hours he gave vent to shouts and yells that were heard far and wide. In the Rue Garanci\\xc3\\xa8re the crowd kept growing bigger and bigger. All had their eyes fixed on the unhappy creature, and whenever he stumbled on the slates, which cracked beneath him, they gave a shout of terror. In the midst of the crowd, the Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Patouille, who expected every moment to see him hurled into space, was reciting the prayers for the dying, and making ready to give him the absolution _in extremis_. There was a cordon of police round the house keeping order. Someone summoned the fire-brigade, and the sound of their approach was soon heard. They placed a ladder against the wall of the house, and after a terrific struggle managed to secure the maniac, who in the course of his desperate resistance had one of the muscles of his arm torn out. He was immediately removed to an asylum.\r\n\r\nMaurice dined at home, and there were smiles of tenderness and affection when Victor, the old butler, brought on the roast veal. Monsieur l'Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Patouille sat at the right hand of the Christian mother, unctuously contemplating the family which Heaven had so plentifully blessed. Nevertheless, Madame d'Esparvieu was ill at ease. Every day she received anonymous letters of so insulting and coarse a nature that she thought at first they must come from a discharged footman. She now knew they were the handiwork of her youngest daughter, Berthe, a mere child! Little L\\xc3\\xa9on, too, gave her pain and anxiety. He paid no attention to his lessons, and was given to bad habits. He showed a cruel disposition. He had plucked his sister's canaries alive; he stuck innumerable pins into the chair on which Mademoiselle Caporal was accustomed to sit, and had stolen fourteen francs from the poor girl, who did nothing but cry and dab her eyes and nose from morning till night.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was dinner over than Maurice rushed off to the little dwelling in the Rue de Rome, impatient to meet his angel again. Through the door he heard a loud sound of voices, and saw assembled in the room where the apparition had taken place, Arcade, Zita, the angelic musician, and the Ker\\xc3\\xbbb, who was lying on the bed, smoking a huge pipe, carelessly scorching pillows, sheets, and coverlets. They embraced Maurice, and announced their departure. Their faces shone with happiness and courage. Alone, the inspired author of _Aline, Queen of Golconda_, shed tears and raised his terrified gaze to heaven. The Ker\\xc3\\xbbb forced him into the party of rebellion by setting before him two alternatives: either to allow himself to be dragged from prison to prison on earth, or to carry fire and sword into the palace of Ialdabaoth.\r\n\r\nMaurice perceived with sorrow that the earth had scarcely any hold over them. They were setting out filled with immense hope, which was quite justifiable. Doubtless they were but a few combatants to oppose the innumerable soldiers of the sultan of the heavens; but they counted on compensating for the inferiority of their numbers by the irresistible impetus of a sudden attack. They were not ignorant of the fact that Ialdabaoth, who flatters himself on knowing all things, sometimes allows himself to be taken by surprise. And it certainly looked as if the first attack would have taken him unawares had it not been for the warning of the archangel Michael. The celestial army had made no progress since its victory over the rebels before the beginning of Time.\r\n\r\nAs regards armaments and material it was as out of date as the army of the Moors. Its generals slumbered in sloth and ignorance. Loaded with honours and riches, they preferred the delights of the banquet to the fatigues of war. Michael, the commander-in-chief, ever loyal and brave, had lost, with the passing of centuries, his fire and enthusiasm. The conspirators of 1914, on the other hand, knew the very latest and the most delicate appliances of science for the art of destruction. At length all was ready and decided upon. The army of revolt, assembled by corps each a hundred thousand angels strong, on all the waste places of the earth--steppes, pampas, deserts, fields of ice and snow--was ready to launch itself against the sky. The angels, in modifying the rhythm of the atoms of which they are composed, are able to traverse the most varied mediums. Spirits that have descended on to the earth, being formed, since their incarnation, of too compact a substance, can no longer fly of themselves, and to rise into ethereal regions and then insensibly grow volatilized, have need of the assistance of their brothers, who, though revolutionaries like themselves, nevertheless, stayed behind in the Empyrean and remained, not immaterial (for all is matter in the Universe), but gloriously untrammelled and diaphanous. Certes, it was not without painful anxiety that Arcade, Istar, and Zita prepared themselves to pass from the heavy atmosphere of the earth to the limpid depths of the heavens. To plunge into the ether there is need to expend such energy that the most intrepid hesitate to take flight. Their very substance, while penetrating this fine medium, must in itself grow fine-spun, become vaporised, and pass from human dimensions to the volume of the vastest clouds which have ever enveloped the earth. Soon they would surpass in grandeur the uttermost planets, whose orbits they, invisible and imponderable, would traverse without disturbing.\r\n\r\nIn this enterprise--the vastest that angels could undertake--their substance would be ultimately hotter than the fire and colder than the ice, and they would suffer pangs sharper than death.\r\n\r\nMaurice read all the daring and the pain of the undertaking in the eyes of Arcade.\r\n\r\n\"You are going?\" he said to him, weeping.\r\n\r\n\"We are going, with Nectaire, to seek the great archangel to lead us to victory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whom do you call thus?\"\r\n\r\n\"The priests of the demiurge have made him known to you in their calumnies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unhappy being,\" sighed Maurice.\r\n\r\nArcade embraced him, and Maurice felt the angel's tears as they dropped upon his cheek.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n     AND LAST, WHEREIN THE SUBLIME DREAM OF SATAN IS UNFOLDED\r\n\r\n\r\nClimbing the seven steep terraces which rise up from the bed of the Ganges to the temples muffled in creepers, the five angels reached, by half-obliterated paths, the wild garden filled with perfumed clusters of grapes and chattering monkeys, and, at the far end thereof, they discovered him whom they had come to seek. The archangel lay with his elbow on black cushions embroidered with golden flames. At his feet crouched lions and gazelles. Twined in the trees, tame serpents turned on him their friendly gaze. At the sight of his angelic visitors his face grew melancholy. Long since, in the days when, with his brow crowned with grapes and his sceptre of vine-leaves in his hand, he had taught and comforted mankind, his heart had many times been heavy with sorrow; but never yet, since his glorious downfall, had his beautiful face expressed such pain and anguish.\r\n\r\nZita told him of the black standards assembled in crowds in all the waste places of the globe; of the deliverance premeditated and prepared in the provinces of Heaven, where the first revolt had long ago been fomented.\r\n\r\n\"Prince,\" she went on, \"your army awaits you. Come, lead it on to victory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Friends,\" replied the great archangel, \"I was aware of the object of your visit. Baskets of fruit and honeycombs await you under the shade of this mighty tree. The sun is about to descend into the roseate waters of the Sacred River. When you have eaten, you will slumber pleasantly in this garden, where the joys of the intellect and of the senses have reigned since the day when I drove hence the spirit of the old Demiurge. To-morrow I will give you my answer.\"\r\n\r\nNight hung its blue over the garden. Satan fell asleep. He had a dream, and in that dream, soaring over the earth, he saw it covered with angels in revolt, beautiful as gods, whose eyes darted lightning. And from pole to pole one single cry, formed of a myriad cries, mounted towards him, filled with hope and love. And Satan said:\r\n\r\n\"Let us go forth! Let us seek the ancient adversary in his high abode.\" And he led the countless host of angels over the celestial plains. And Satan was cognizant of what took place in the heavenly citadel. When news of this second revolt came thither, the Father said to the Son:\r\n\r\n\"The irreconcilable foe is rising once again. Let us take heed to ourselves, and in this, our time of danger, look to our defences, lest we lose our high abode.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the Son, consubstantial with the Father, replied:\r\n\r\n\"We shall triumph under the sign that gave Constantine the victory.\"\r\n\r\nIndignation burst forth on the Mountain of God. At first the faithful Seraphim condemned the rebels to terrible torture, but afterwards decided on doing battle with them. The anger burning in the hearts of all inflamed each countenance. They did not doubt of victory, but treachery was feared, and eternal darkness had been at once decreed for spies and alarmists.\r\n\r\nThere was shouting and singing of ancient hymns and praise of the Almighty. They drank of the mystic wine. Courage, over-inflated, came near to giving way, and a secret anxiety stole into the inner depths of their souls. The archangel Michael took supreme command. He reassured their minds by his serenity. His countenance, wherein his soul was visible, expressed contempt for danger. By his orders, the chiefs of the thunderbolts, the Ker\\xc3\\xbbbs, grown dull with the long interval of peace, paced with heavy steps the ramparts of the Holy Mountain, and, letting the gaze of their bovine eyes wander over the glittering clouds of their Lord, strove to place the divine batteries in position. After inspecting the defences, they swore to the Most High that all was in readiness. They took counsel together as to the plan they should follow. Michael was for the offensive. He, as a consummate soldier, said it was the supreme law. Attack, or be attacked,--there was no middle course.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover,\" he added, \"the offensive attitude is particularly suitable to the ardour of the Thrones and Dominations.\"\r\n\r\nBeyond that, it was impossible to obtain a word from the valiant chief, and this silence seemed the mark of a genius sure of himself.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the approach of the enemy was announced, Michael sent forth three armies to meet them, commanded by the archangels Uriel, Raphael, and Gabriel. Standards, displaying all the colours of the Orient, were unfurled above the ethereal plains, and the thunders rolled over the starry floors. For three days and three nights was the lot of the terrible and adorable armies unknown on the Mountain of God. Towards dawn on the fourth day news came, but it was vague and confused. There were rumours of indecisive victories; of the triumph now of this side, now of that. There came reports of glorious deeds which were dissipated in a few hours.\r\n\r\nThe thunderbolts of Raphael, hurled against the rebels, had, it was said, consumed entire squadrons. The troops commanded by the impure Zita were thought to have been swallowed up in the whirlwind of a tempest of fire. It was believed that the savage Istar had been flung headlong into the gulf of perdition so suddenly that the blasphemies begun in his mouth had been forced backwards with explosive results. It was popularly supposed that Satan, laden with chains of adamant, had been plunged once again into the abyss. Meanwhile, the commanders of the three armies had sent no messages. Mutterings and murmurs, mingling with the rumours of glory, gave rise to fears of an indecisive battle, a precipitate retreat. Insolent voices gave out that a spirit of the lowest category, a guardian angel, the insignificant Arcade, had checked and routed the dazzling host of the three great archangels.\r\n\r\nThere were also rumours of wholesale defection in the Seventh Heaven, where rebellion had broken out before the beginning of Time, and some had even seen black clouds of impious angels joining the armies of the rebels on Earth. But no one lent an ear to the odious rumours, and stress was laid on the news of victory which ran from lip to lip, each statement readily finding confirmation. The high places resounded with hymns of joy; the Seraphim celebrated on harp and psaltery Sabaoth, God of Thunder. The voices of the elect united with those of the angels in glorifying the Invisible and at the thought of the bloodshed that the ministers of holy wrath had caused among the rebels, sighs of relief and jubilation were wafted from the Heavenly Jerusalem towards the Most High. But the beatitude of the most blessed, having swelled to the utmost limit before due time, could increase no more, and the very excess of their felicity completely dulled their senses.\r\n\r\nThe songs had not yet ceased when the guards watching on the ramparts signalled the approach of the first fugitives of the divine army; Seraphim on tattered wing, flying in disorder, maimed Ker\\xc3\\xbbbs going on three feet. With impassive gaze, Michael, prince of warriors, measured the extent of the disaster, and his keen intelligence penetrated its causes. The armies of the living God had taken the offensive, but by one of those fatalities in war which disconcert the plans of the greatest captains, the enemy had also taken the offensive, and the effect was evident. Scarcely were the gates of the citadel opened to receive the glorious but shattered remnants of the three armies, when a rain of fire fell on the Mountain of God. Satan's army was not yet in sight, but the walls of topaz, the cupolas of emerald, the roofs of diamond, all fell in with an appalling crash under the discharge of the electrophores. The ancient thunderclouds essayed to reply, but the bolts fell short, and their thunders were lost in the deserted plains of the skies.\r\n\r\nSmitten by an invisible foe, the faithful angels abandoned the ramparts. Michael went to announce to his God that the Holy Mountain would fall into the hands of the demon in twenty-four hours, and that nothing remained for the Master of the Heavens but to seek safety in flight. The Seraphim placed the jewels of the celestial crown in coffers. Michael offered his arm to the Queen of Heaven, and the Holy Family escaped from the palace by a subterranean passage of porphyry. A deluge of fire was falling on the citadel. Regaining his post once more, the glorious archangel declared that he would never capitulate, and straightway advanced the standards of the living God. That same evening the rebel host made its entry into the thrice-sacred city. On a fiery steed Satan led his demons. Behind him marched Arcade, Istar, and Zita. As in the ancient revels of Dionysus, old Nectaire bestrode his ass. Thereafter, floating out far behind, followed the black standards.\r\n\r\nThe garrison laid down their arms before Satan. Michael placed his flaming sword at the feet of the conquering archangel.\r\n\r\n\"Take back your sword, Michael,\" said Satan. \"It is Lucifer who yields it to you. Bear it in defence of peace and law.\" Then letting his gaze fall on the leaders of the celestial cohorts, he cried in a ringing voice:\r\n\r\n\"Archangel Michael, and you, Powers, Thrones, and Dominations, swear all of you to be faithful to your God.\"\r\n\r\n\"We swear it,\" they replied with one voice.\r\n\r\nAnd Satan said:\r\n\r\n\"Powers, Thrones, and Dominations, of all past wars, I wish but to remember the invincible courage that you displayed and the loyalty which you rendered to authority, for these assure me of the steadfastness of the fealty you have just sworn to me.\"\r\n\r\nThe following day, on the ethereal plain, Satan commanded the black standards to be distributed to the troops, and the winged soldiers covered them with kisses and bedewed them with tears.\r\n\r\nAnd Satan had himself crowned God. Thronging round the glittering walls of Heavenly Jerusalem, apostles, pontiffs, virgins, martyrs, confessors, the whole company of the elect, who during the fierce battle had enjoyed delightful tranquillity, tasted infinite joy in the spectacle of the coronation.\r\n\r\nThe elect saw with ravishment the Most High precipitated into Hell, and Satan seated on the throne of the Lord. In conformity with the will of God which had cut them off from sorrow they sang in the ancient fashion the praises of their new Master.\r\n\r\nAnd Satan, piercing space with his keen glance, contemplated the little globe of earth and water where of old he had planted the vine and formed the first tragic chorus. And he fixed his gaze on that Rome where the fallen God had founded his empire on fraud and lie. Nevertheless, at that moment a saint ruled over the Church. Satan saw him praying and weeping. And he said to him:\r\n\r\n\"To thee I entrust my Spouse. Watch over her faithfully. In thee I confirm the right and power to decide matters of doctrine, to regulate the use of the sacraments, to make laws and to uphold purity of morals. And the faithful shall be under obligation to conform thereto. My Church is eternal, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. Thou art infallible. Nothing is changed.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the successor of the apostles felt flooded with rapture. He prostrated himself, and with his forehead touching the floor, replied:\r\n\r\n\"O Lord, my God, I recognise Thy voice! Thy breath has been wafted like balm to my heart. Blessed be Thy name. Thy will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Satan found pleasure in praise and in the exercise of his grace; he loved to hear his wisdom and his power belauded. He listened with joy to the canticles of the cherubim who celebrated his good deeds, and he took no pleasure in listening to Nectaire's flute, because it celebrated nature's self, yielded to the insect and to the blade of grass their share of power and love, and counselled happiness and freedom. Satan, whose flesh had crept, in days gone by, at the idea that suffering prevailed in the world, now felt himself inaccessible to pity. He regarded suffering and death as the happy results of omnipotence and sovereign kindness. And the savour of the blood of victims rose upward towards him like sweet incense. He fell to condemning intelligence and to hating curiosity. He himself refused to learn anything more, for fear that in acquiring fresh knowledge he might let it be seen that he had not known everything at the very outset. He took pleasure in mystery, and believing that he would seem less great by being understood, he affected to be unintelligible. Dense fumes of Theology filled his brain. One day, following the example of his predecessor, he conceived the notion of proclaiming himself one god in three persons. Seeing Arcade smile as this proclamation was made, he drove him from his presence. Istar and Zita had long since returned to earth. Thus centuries passed like seconds. Now, one day, from the altitude of his throne, he plunged his gaze into the depths of the pit and saw Ialdabaoth in the Gehenna where he himself had long lain enchained. Amid the everlasting gloom Ialdabaoth still retained his lofty mien. Blackened and shattered, terrible and sublime, he glanced upwards at the palace of the King of Heaven with a look of proud disdain, then turned away his head. And the new god, as he looked upon his foe, beheld the light of intelligence and love pass across his sorrow-stricken countenance. And lo! Ialdabaoth was now contemplating the Earth and, seeing it sunk in wickedness and suffering, he began to foster thoughts of kindliness in his heart. On a sudden he rose up, and beating the ether with his mighty arms, as though with oars, he hastened thither to instruct and to console mankind. Already his vast shadow shed upon the unhappy planet a shade soft as a night of love.\r\n\r\nAnd Satan awoke bathed in an icy sweat.\r\n\r\nNectaire, Istar, Arcade, and Zita were standing round him. The finches were singing.\r\n\r\n\"Comrades,\" said the great archangel, \"no--we will not conquer the heavens. Enough to have the power. War engenders war, and victory defeat.\r\n\r\n\"God, conquered, will become Satan; Satan, conquering, will become God. May the fates spare me this terrible lot; I love the Hell which formed my genius. I love the Earth where I have done some good, if it be possible to do any good in this fearful world where beings live but by rapine. Now, thanks to us, the god of old is dispossessed of his terrestrial empire, and every thinking being on this globe disdains him or knows him not. But what matter that men should be no longer submissive to Ialdabaoth if the spirit of Ialdabaoth is still in them; if they, like him, are jealous, violent, quarrelsome, and greedy, and the foes of the arts and of beauty? What matter that they have rejected the ferocious Demiurge, if they do not hearken to the friendly demons who teach all truths; to Dionysus, Apollo, and the Muses? As to ourselves, celestial spirits, sublime demons, we have destroyed Ialdabaoth, our Tyrant, if in ourselves we have destroyed Ignorance and Fear.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Satan, turning to the gardener, said:\r\n\r\n\"Nectaire, you fought with me before the birth of the world. We were conquered because we failed to understand that Victory is a Spirit, and that it is in ourselves and in ourselves alone that we must attack and destroy Ialdabaoth.\"\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+   | Transcriber's Notes                                          |   |                                                              |   | Page 74: \"Madame des Aubel's\" amended to \"Madame des         |   |     Aubels'\"                                                 |   | Page 170: \"clomb\" _sic_ (archaic; past tense of _climb_).    |   | Page 210: \"befel\" _sic_ (archaic).                           |   | Page 230: \"Bouchette\" amended to \"Bouchotte\"                 |   | Page 234: \"befel\" _sic_ (archaic).                           |   | Page 259: \"cetain\" amended to \"certain\"                      |   | Page 278: \"youself\" amended to \"yourself\"                    |   | Page 284: \"wistaria\" _sic_; alternative spelling.            |   | Page 309: \"Bergundy\" amended to \"Burgundy\"                   |   |                                                              |   | Accents and hyphenation have generally been standardised.    |   +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE REVOLT OF THE ANGELS ***\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one-the old editions will be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.

In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'",
