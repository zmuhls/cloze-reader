# Deployment Rules

## Rule 1 

Remember to use `npm run dev` to launch the typescript application NOT `open index.html`

## Rule 2

Always remember that there is meant to be a GitHub pages deployment of this TypeScript application with its use of OpenRouter tool calling for fetching and redacting words in book passages sourced from the manu/project_gutenberg dataset. OpenRouter tool tooling function should also now be directed to pull from a natively hosted dataset fetched from [manu/project_gutenberg dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/manu/project_gutenberg) on Hugging Face.
