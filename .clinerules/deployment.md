# Deployment Rules

## Rule 1 

Remember to use `npm run dev` to launch the typescript application rather than `open index.html`.

## Rule 2

Always remember that there is meant to be a GitHub pages deployment of this TypeScript application with its use of OpenRouter tool and function calling for fetching and redacting tokens from Gutenberg texts for the purposes of the game.
