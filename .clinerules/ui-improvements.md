# UI Improvement Guidelines

## Button Standardization Rule

All interactive buttons in the game UI must:

1. Use consistent sizing: min-width 90px, min-height 36px
2. Share the same base styling class set
3. Be positioned in a single control row when possible
4. Be visible only when their action is relevant

## Text Display Rule

All game text elements must:

1. Use the typewriter font family and styling
2. Be left-aligned for readability (except titles and headers)
3. Use proper semantic HTML elements
4. Have consistent spacing and padding

## Interaction Pattern Rule

The game's interaction flow must:

1. Keep "Continue" button consistently styled and positioned with other buttons
2. Make analysis optional and user-triggered rather than automatically displayed
3. Ensure all interactive elements are easily tappable on mobile (min 36px height)
4. Maintain a clear visual hierarchy between primary and secondary actions
